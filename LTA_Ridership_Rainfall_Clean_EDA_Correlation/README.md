# Project 1: Data Analysis of Singapore Rainfall


Project Objectives:

Analyze the rainfall in the Singapore and identify if it has any affect on the train riderships. Extend findings to Lead Data Analyst to further propose recommendations where the efforts should be focused on in order to increase transportation efficiency.

Data used:

The total rainfall, maximum rainfall, raltive humidity, number of rainy days and ridership by month from 2014 to 2022.

Data Dictionary:

Five main datasets were used in this project. The data dictionaries of the datasets can be found below.



| Feature          | Type    | Dataset                              | Description               |   |
|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|---|
| total_rainfall   | float   | rainfall-monthly-total               | Monthly Total Rainfall by month from 2014 to 2022  |   |
| highest_daily    | float   | rainfall-monthly-highest-daily-total | Monthly Highest Rainfall by month from 2014 to 2022  |   |
| relative_humidity| float   | relative-humidity-monthly-mean       | Monthly Relative Humidity by month from 2014 to 2022 |   |
| ridership        | int | Average Daily Ridership              | Average Daily Ridership by month from 2014 to 2022  |   |
| rain_days        | int | rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days | Monthly Relative Humidity by month from 2014 to 2022 |   |



Key takeaways from the analysis:

Rainfall and ridership are directly related to each other. In the upper quartile region of the rainfall data, there are more riderships. However, there are times when ridership are higher but qualifies as an outlier as this is due the COVID-pandemic and internationational events where there is an influx of higher number of tourism. e.g F1 Grand Prix

Recommendations:

Months Affected:

Monsoon seasons Nov and Dec

Methods recommended:

Frequent maintenance works on selected months to prevent faults and downtime as there is higher riderships
Secondly, higher number of train frequncy 
Thirdly, incentivise commuters on the selected months so as to spread the cogested timings
