3,149odnt,How do you cope when you go from manic to depressed overnight?,I have been manic for two weeks and then yesterday I just fell off which isn't too surprising as I always get depressed after I've been manic.  I was writing like crazy for two weeks and then yesterday it was like there was just nothing left and I slept for 12 hours last night and then napped another two today.  I feel generally blah and apathetic and I don't want to do anything.  I know I should practice opposite action but I just have zero energy.  Any coping mechanisms?,15,0
4,1497cwy,Quit my job last week during an episode. Regretting it now.,"School teacher. Love my class, but I have a couple who have ‘the most extreme behaviour I have ever seen in 20 years’ according to my current acting principal. 

Took a week off for my mental health because I felt a manic state coming on after a particularly stressful week. At the beginning of the week I honestly felt like I never wanted to go back because I was mentally stuck and I let my (acting) principal know this. The last thing I needed to do was be forced to make a decision.

Against any sort of protocol (the union is now furious with him) my principal forced me to make a decision in the middle of my unpaid leave, that I took for mental health reasons, off school campus, in my the middle of a manic episode.

Really regretting my decision. Love my students and have been crying all week because they don’t want me to leave. I have a desk full of cards from them. They just announced my resignation to all the other staff, parents and students at the school and I don’t want to leave. I have no fucking idea what to do now.

Edit: talking to the union would be a good option but I’ve only been working for 6 months and am not part of the union yet.",137,0

6,149iwv3,How did you learn to accept your diagnosis?,"Because I feel like I cannot and I’ve been researching extensively and obsessing to find any other reason that could explain my behavior and comin up dry…

I’m going through my last 12 years of life (I’m 29) and realizing that my “infinite energy” isn’t really my baseline mood because i inevitably crash… my version mania or hypomania ticks literally every single box (completely wreckless behavior, traveling all over the world never stopping, oversharing, prostitution, excessive drug and alcohol use, spending sprees on stuff for my sister, talking over people, hyper sexuality, feeling euphoric etc etc…) besides hallucination and hospitalization, even though I can check all of these boxes without a doubt in my mind I’m still convinced I’m making this all up and I’m losing sleep over this diagnosis. 

I’m rummaging all corners of the internet to see what other people’s experiences with mania is because I’m just the type of person that cannot take anything at face value, and since there is no difinitive test for bipolar disorder my nerves are just shot looking for answers. They tell me I have bipolar 2 but I feel way more mania than depression and it feels like it’s been constant since I started my antidepressant 4 years ago (lessening since I quit drinking and drugs) Thank you in advance.

Edit: I was diagnosed officially (for the 4th time) with Bipolar 2, PTSD and PMDD last Wednesday and have been kind of feeling weird about it since then",20,0

I was told that being zapped of your energy is actually a very typical symptom of bipolar and sometimes it can mimic sleep disorders.

The worst part about it is I only started feeling this way after my mom got diagnosed with a terminal disease. Before this I would say I was someone that had excellent energy and pizzazz. And now I feel like I'm permanently stuck in the exhausted mode. It makes life so hard!

17,149ry8z,First time posting-here we go,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least). 

Long story short-I'd left an abusive situation a little over a year ago from a controlling narcissist who didn't believe treatment would help and immediately blocked them, to entering the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (a month and a half after that) with my supportive boyfriend who was my best friend a couple of years before. As well as extremely supportive family/close friends.

On top of the medications I've been taking (only for a few months), I consume Delta 9 THC which has helped me calm down from hypomania. This doesn't work for everyone and I'm definitely not saying to consume it if you're not comfortable-but this is just how it works for me. 

&#x200B;

Also-I want to throw this out there and see if there's any similarities with anyone else, but my boyfriend AND my best friend have told me these when I've been entering hypomania;

\- twitchy hands (when standing still)

\- fidgeting in place / erratic behavior 

\- pacing the same path (without change in pattern or speed) 

\- incredibly fast heart-rate (my boyfriend was holding me and said that it felt like my heart was racing out of my chest)

I want to hear success stories from people who came off their meds and have been stable, but I also want to hear from people who didn't have such a good time coming off their meds. Are we really doomed for a life of taking medication?

20,149i8qb,Feeling hopeless due to no job prospects,Hey all. I’ve been trying to feel better since I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 but it’s really hard to without a job and income. I quit a really good job at the beginning of my manic episode and haven’t been able to find one since. I have a college degree and can’t even find a retail job to hire me. I worked a serving job for like a week but it took more of a toll on my mental health and I felt degraded. This has caused me to be very depressed and suicidal. I only get interviews but no job offers. I’m halfway through the month and rent will be due soon. The only reason I’ve been able to get by is because of my mom and boyfriend. I feel like a financial burden to everyone. I’m in debt and the bills keep piling. I’ve been on serequol and abilify. Those haven’t worked. I just got switched to lamitical but I’m tired of not feeling ok. I’m tired of being broke. The cost of living is too high. I can’t afford anything.

I enjoy my booze a litte too much. I've gotten locked up to a hospital bed against my will. Been delusional, paranoid, angry. 

But I hide it so well most of the time. I deny it all too often. I fake it just so I can have a somewhat regular life. I trick myself into believing it's not real.

I use Daylio too and have the habit of writing down whatever I am thinking for the day since I have trouble remembering specifics from day to day. This time when I came down from mania I know I had my usual urge to run away but when I looked back at my journal entries I had fully developed plans for leaving to stay at my grandparents old place (now abandoned) and how to get a flight to the netherlands and get to japan from there. This really worried me, and I tried to convey this to my husband. He just kind of brushed it off. He’s the one who usually keeps an eye on me during those episodes.

32,149flim,Mania has been getting embarrassing,"Gotta vent but my brain is in tangent mode so sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’ve been fluctuating in a hypomanic-manic state for a couple of months now but I’ve been able to mostly keep things ok until the last month. I’ve definitely been fueling it and I know that but I’m just so afraid of the crash and I want to prolong that coming as long as I can. Drinking has been a big part of the fueling. I do embarrassing shit all the time when I’m in these episodes but last night I was told about something I had done and I feel nauseous over it. I’ve been seeing this guy, who I’m not even sure I should be seeing. He’s a regular at the bar I work at and I don’t ever go out with coworkers or customers like I don’t like to fuck with my money but here we are I decided to go out with him anyways this time. We’ve hung out a handful of times over the last couple weeks and the second time, I went to his place, we drank and had sex and I slept there then went home, just like the first time. But in the morning everything just felt off and I just didn’t feel super comfortable pursuing this and I kind of just decided to be apathetic about it and only go back over if he really pushed for it and if I was wanting the attention. Sounds shitty cause it is. Idc at this point. So I didn’t really talk to him for a few days and then he came into my work the next week and things felt ok again so I went over there after work and things seemed normal. So I proceeded like that one morning was just a fluke. Last night when we were hanging out he said something about “ it just kind of threw me off when you were laying in my kitchen alone” and I’m like tf are you talking about? And he was genuinely shocked that I didn’t remember. As he explained, suddenly the experience came back to me and I’m about to cringe typing it out. That second time I came over and things felt off the next day was because I had a fuckin panic attack and then my brain blocked it out ?? That night after we had sex, he went into the bathroom and while he was in there I began to have a panic attack (also I hadn’t had sex in over a year before hooking up with him due to trauma that isn’t fully resolved, clearly lol) so I went into the kitchen I guess idk what my thinking was. He said he came out and I was like nearly fetal position rocking and I was saying that I needed to leave but I was way drunk so he didn’t want me to drive. he coaxed me out of it and got me to go to bed eventually but OH MY GOD that shit is so embarrassing. I’m lowkey wondering what’s wrong with him that he’s still interested in me when that was the second time we ever hung out but like UGH this is the stuff that makes me not mix work with all of that now every time him and his friends come into my job I’ll know that they all know how unstable I am.

Money issues and stresses are on my mind literally constantly and I just feel like I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do, because I put myself in this situation. 
I feel like if therapy and meds were helping I shouldn’t have had a manic episode and spent so much. And when I do have issues I shouldn’t be having break downs and self harm thoughts.

41,149l9we,Is it mania or do I have a real problem in my relationship :/,"I am manic rn. I haven't slept in a few days. A common thing w/ mania for me is hypersexuality.

I've always been in monogamous long term relationships with friends, never been on a date or met someone outside a friend group.

I'm married. Happy to be married, can expound on that more, but my husband is very giving, sensitive, gentle, yet unfortunately suffers from low self esteem and a sense of timidness.

We haven't had sex in forever. I couldn't hope to tell you the last time we would have, like past a year at this point, and the last time would have been a 'quickie'.

When I'm not manic, I'm usually OK w/ it. I'm not 'happy' about it, but I don't think about it every day or talk about it all the time.

But when I am manic, I care soooo much. And I skip from how I think someone else might normally go 'oh this bothers me, it will build up slowly, I'll try to talk about it.' I instantly go 'well this exact same day I want to go find someone to flirt and/or sleep with'. I've never done that, even when not in a relationship, but it's like I have NO boundaries immediately.

Am I trying to blame my bipolar since I'm like whatever the rest of the time except mania, or am I using it as an excuse for not addressing it more w/ him when it's a problem regardless?

Dunno where to go from here :/ I'm in therapy and a terrible client bc my therapist says hey you need to talk about this, how did it go last week talking about this, oh you still haven't done it I can't think of another way to tell you to get over it and do it lmao",2,0

45,149pmbk,How to move on from manic behavior?,"A few months ago I had a full blown manic episode with psychosis. I was in a really good position in my life. I was dating, doing well at work, exercising regularly, and going out. But despite being medicated, I still had a bad episode.

During this episode I said some weird things. I accused some peers of things like poisoning me and said I was pregnant (awful, I know). I didn’t say this stuff directly to the people I was accusing, and the people I said this to aren’t even friends with the people I accused, so they might not even know I said this, but I still feel mortified. I know I was wrong for saying these things, but this was the first episode I’ve had with auditory hallucinations so my delusions seemed so real and I was extremely frightened.

I was episode free for almost five years, was in a different environment than which I had my last episode, and was really trying to preserve my new reputation and have a fresh start. I’m normally a really relaxed, “chill” person but now I feel like a basket case and feel seen as “crazy”.

I know everyone has moved on and I doubt anyone still thinks about my behavior, so I how can I finally move on from this?

I’m also a major perfectionist so I tend to linger/obsess on my faults. I keep comparing myself to my peers bc I also had to a take time off from work due to my episode and I feel like everyone is advancing/doing well in life besides me. Any advice is welcomed.",1,0

I was fine showing up everyday. i didn’t LOVE it (i’ll never love a job), but it was bearable. 

Until yesterday when my coworker lied directly to my managers face about me and there was nothing i could do. I tried to point out she was lying, but my manager waved it off. I was enraged. My rage gets really bad and scary, but random strangers or coworkers have NEVER set it off before. Usually because i don’t care enough about them.

I paced around the room for about 30 minutes (idk how nobody noticed or maybe they just didn’t say anything) while fighting back tears from being so angry and not being able to do anything about it. 

my rage is the absolute worst part of this disorder for me personally. and now this job has triggered it while also being the ONLY job to ever do so. i’m terrified to go back to work today. if this happens again, and i can’t hold it together, the cops will 100% be called on me. maybe working is just impossible for me.

So Ive been on 600mg of Seroquel XR for about a year now, but almost every time I take it at night and a wait a little (~1 hr) the sleepiness starts to settle in I start to get either 1) feelings of impending doom, like everything is gonna get f*cked soon or 2) how my life is a mistake after mistake, regret after regret. 

When this happens, I either go to bed and wake up feeling fine or it would last 1 or 2 hours then completely go away.

59,1492bw6,"Started meds maybe over a year ago, my mania and depressive episodes have gone, but my anxiety is still super high.","I was diagnosed roughly last year, and I have taken meds from Albilify, Lamcital , and lithium. (Don't remember exact names). I also take Concerta (ADHD meds, but they suspect I don't have ADHD)

For the most part, my mania and depressive episodes have gone. At least the emotional aspect.

I usually start manic episodes around  April and nothing even close to that has started. Just feel anxiety all the time. 

I still have a very difficult time doing regular things, like consistently keeping my house clean, working out regularly, eating properly, getting things done, etc. 

I barely do them. I have extreme anxiety before I do them, and I just can't start. And I only start when I realize that I am fucked and just start doing things during panic mode. 

So I feel like I am physically depressed while I am not emotionally depressed. My mania phase has completely gone and has not come back. I sometimes I wish I was manic, it was much better than now. 

I also feel like I don't want to get into social situations. I don't want to meet people unless I have to, and I don't even want to think about dating. When I was manic, I was dating around like crazy.

Obviously since I am not taking care of myself, I completely let myself go, I look old and ugly, and I am wearing the same shit over and over again, my hair is getting long and I am just extremely unhappy with the way I look. 

So, putting this altogether, it's giving me extreme anxiety. And therefore I am in this constant loop. 

I thought medication would help me stop behaving this way, but I still feel this aspect to be the same and in some cases worse. 

I told my doctor, and he said from a third-party point of view, he thinks I am doing well. I walk my dogs everyday for an hour or more. I am doing pretty decently at work. I ""try"" to be social by going out once in a while, etc. 

He told me that the only way I can get out of this ""slump"", as I call it, is through routine and discipline and there's like no ""meds"" that can make me motivated.

61,149aj3d,Bipolar 2 and psychosis?,"So, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 last April, and after hospitalization last month I've started a partial hospitalization program. The new therapists and clinicians I see there think I may experience psychosis, which is a totally new diagnosis for me. Admittedly I've had experiences since early adolescence that seem to fall on the psychosis spectrum: brief auditory hallucinations, intense fear that someone was in my home and I needed to hide from them (so I'd lock myself in a bathroom or closet for an hour or more), and intense, unrelenting anxiety that follows ""obsessive patterns."" When I attempted suicide, I felt almost compelled to do it, not by a voice or anything but this feeling of inevitably and ""I'm a burden and need to be punished."" Then in the hospital I had a horrifying vision, and after coming home I had the same vision and have had fear of the dark since (though it's been less than 2 weeks). I started Latuda 2 weeks ago and everyone is very confident it will help, so I think I'm posting here because I'm just confused. I thought psychotic features made you bipolar type 1 by definition?

63,149fosq,Can mania be subtle?,"Hello. I was diagnosed Bipolar at 23 years old. Didn’t want to hear it. Then shit hit the fan that year. Long story short, I had a mental breakdown. Dropped out of college. Quit my full time job. Got a studio apartment I was nowhere near ready for. Got into heavy drinking. Got into drugs. Did a lot of wild/questionable things. 
Now we are here. 
I’m 29 years old. Married. Almost 5 years clean. Pretty much sober the past 3 years with the exception of a very occasional drink. Work a full time job. Go to therapy. My life is stable, I have a lot of coping skills, and I value all of this. 

That being said, I can see how my party girl days can definitely scream mania. However, in my stable life style, sometimes I question if I’m Bipolar…I do swing from long periods of depression/anxiety to periods of feeling “normal.” Now normal to me might be what the mania is? I feel happy, productive, motivated; but I also stay up a little later (and I mean a little- like I fall asleep at midnight instead of 10pm). I get big ideas, but in my head I’m justifying them as I’m not depressed- so get everything done! Clean, catch up on alllll bills, think about vacations, look into moving finally (we want to move in the next two years). I get pretty hyper about this stuff though and my husband says I pump the gas too fast when I’m feeling this way. 

So is this depression and I’m just emerging from a depressive episode…or is it actually Bipolar and my mania is just better managed due to using my tools? 

PS- I’ve tried a couple a bipolar medications, but I was allergic to Lamictal and Depakote alone made me very depressed. 
On the same page, I had what my doctor called rapid cycling on Zoloft and Wellbutrin by themselves. 
I’m also diagnosed ADHD, C-PTSD, and OCD. Only taking Buspar at the moment. 

So my doctors probably onto something and I’m just in denial I’m sure lol.

Then came december 2022, i was having some problems like low energy, not wanting to go to work, i talked to my doctor and he asked me to raise the dosage to 200 mg. Which i did.
In a few days i was back on my routine, working, having fun with my friends, started partying a lot was drinking and getting high often. One day my brother and few cousins confronted me that i might be becoming bipolar, i was totally ignorant to that, another day went by, i had a massive fight with everyone at my home and left the house.
Next night i took some mdma which totally went negative and i did a lot of stupid shit. Didn’t harm myself or anyone. My 2 friends were there who handled everything till i calmed down. Now i knew i fucked up and wanted to fix things in any way possible.
A cousin was there who went to my home and told everything to my family, who got me thrown in a rehab. I was picked while i was asleep from my apartment and thrown there, i belong to pakistan and the rehab experience was very miserable it was like being in a prison. I was kept there for 2 months on God knows what medication. Their diagnosis was “drug induced mania”. They didn’t even diagnose me with bipolar or anything else as this was the only isolated incidence i had.
Came back home, my family doesn’t want to talk about any of it. I didn’t go for any follow ups or take the medicine that they recommended.
I wanted to get through all this myself.
But its been 3 months now that i am out of the rehab, i am trying to be strong but i know i am super depressed. My legs keep shaking when i am sitting, i cannot find peace.

The last time I stopped my tegretol was disastrous, I was even in hospital at the time and still got myself in a world of trouble. The antipsychotics I have been on haven’t been improving my mood significantly but had at least taken away the suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts.

The real problem is the fact that more and more people I interact with seem to pick up the fact that there's SOMETHING wrong with me, even if they can't pinpoint what it is. It's like typical people have a sensor that goes off when they are in the presence of someone who doesn't fit in 100%. I don't have any real desire to be wanted or accepted by other people even, I just want them to understand me in a way that doesn't come off as unusual. I've tried approaching it logically, trying to really invest myself in my hobbies and interests, but of course those never take for more than a month or two. The only time I ever had a long sustained interest was when I was full of ritalin and fixated on weird arcane shit during the pandemic. No one wants to talk about that though. When I try to talk to people in social situations, I recieve blank stares as though I just said something obscene. What comment about the weather could I have made that confused or upset them so much? IDK maybe im just paranoid and nothings wrong with me HAHA.

85,148r52y,The guilt of my past behaviour is eating me alive.,"My ex and I were together almost 4 years. 

Last year my diagnosis changed and my psych took me off my antipsychotic and mood stabiliser. After Christmas I began to unravel, coming off lithium I had my first full blown manic psychotic episode. 

When I’m manic I’m truly horrible. I am vile, capricious, psychopathic and verbally hostile. I am truly a disgusting human being to be around. 

My psychiatrist continues to be utterly useless despite me telling them I cannot come off my medication again. The true victim of my episode has been the demise of my relationship. My ex was far from perfect and had many problems of her own, but I cannot help but feel disgusted with myself for how I treated her. I only stabilised back on an antipsychotic recently, and by that point it became too much for her and the relationship beyond repair. 

Whilst I know my ex wasn’t the innocent party I cannot help but feel disgusted and ashamed of myself for how I behaved. It doesn’t help having a psychiatrist who refuses to acknowledge that my mania and psychosis were actually bipolar related. I had issues with substances during the relationship but I tried so hard towards the end to make it right, to get clean and to rebuild our relationship. 

I refuse to point blame at my ex other than for what is reasonable. She was a true hero dealing with me and I pushed her to the edge. I miss her in some ways but the decision to end things was right. 

What I cannot get away from is who I become off meds. Finally being stable again is frightening looking back. Ex tells me my mental health was no excuse, I’m inclined to agree. Fuck me, the whole thing is like a car crash. The house is quiet and I can’t escape the knawing feeling it was my fault.",18,0

I went from being considered a respectable and outgoing girl to someone’s crazy (and I mean crazy as in literally insane) ex girlfriend.

102,148nsnc,Rapid cycling is destroying me,"—Talk of self harm and wanting to give up—

I have been struggling since at least September last year. Either meds adjustments don’t do anything or they work for a short while before everything crashes and burns. 

My depression reached new levels during the last month, and now my mood has been rapid cycling so bad that I have multiple mood swings a day. I literally don’t know what to expect from one minute to the next. Although this has been going on a while today reached a new peak of rapid cycling and I am EXHAUSTED. I feel bad for my husband, I feel bad for myself. 

I have my mom staying with me so that I am not alone while my husband is at work (I have a history of SI, and the urges have surfaced so I discussed my mom staying over with my husband). 

I just want to feel something besides the confusing emotions and thoughts in my head. I want to give up, I know it would destroy my mom and husband but my current existence is no walk in the park to them either. 

It’s a long story I won’t bore you with, but my psychiatrist has been out of reach for a few weeks but we finally talked today and I will go for blood tests tomorrow and get a new prescription. 

Honestly? It’s feels pointless. A waste of time and money. I don’t know anymore…

I think I am self soothing with shopping and I have a plan for something I want.l to buy tomorrow but I don’t want to disappoint my husband. I bought something today that didn’t work as expected, but I bought it cause it was a lot cheaper than the one I really wanted. I know it was stupid but I thought it was the right choice. 

Sometimes I just want to run away but I love my husband and our pets so much. I want to run away from my thoughts and emotions, not them, if that makes sense. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this. I wrote on TrueOffMyChest a while back and only got one response. I deleted my post after a few days.

I remember when I was 6 and I was manic but tbh I always thought I was normal. I haven’t had an easy life I was in and out of the system from birth until I was 14 with a lot of fucked up hiccups in between. I was homeless for a year and then my school help me get some help not mental help but made sure that I was fed and had supplies and stuff. I was in the McKenny-Vento program all through out highschool. Somehow I graduated but I was 20 years old. I became pregnant at 21 and it turned my life around. I did everything I could for my son. Cps was involved in my life shortly after he was born it was a pretty fucked up story and without them being involved I would have never gotten my diagnoses I swore off therapy and counseling because of the abuse I endured throughout my life with them and being forced to take medication and see them when I was younger. I don’t ever remember my diagnoses as a child but my fucked up father swore he knew I didn’t have it until guess what he told me the day after I found out he was bi polar. I struggled everyday of my life I am now 23 with mental illnesses not knowing what it was. I thought I was doing fine. I thought suicidal ideation being manic and depression episodes where normal. After everything I’ve been through which short to nothing of a life in hell I thought it was a normal response. Well anyways i found out I was bi polar in a court room last week. In front of judges and lawyers. I busted down crying it was so traumatic no one had knew that I didn’t know. I was begging for a year to receive my psych evaluation. Cps made me do three of them and I have had 6 caseworkers throughout this whole process and my case has been fucked from the start. I am still processing how to talk about it but finding out in front of a bunch of strangers who decide the fate of my son and mines life broke my heart I busted down crying uncontrollably because for years I argued with everyone who told me I had it that I was wrong. Even my partner who has a bachelors in psychology and sociology was able to diagnose me and has lived and dealt with it for 5 years and it has put a serious strain on our relationship has told me multiple times I have it and I was heartbroken for him and me.

I take venlafaxine for depression/anxiety and it works rather well, finally! I'm also on quetiapine, about 250mg a day, and zopiclone for severe insomnia/restlessness. 

End of this April, I was a victim of domestic and sexual assault by my ex. In that short period of the relationship, he was extremely possessive and controlling, experiencing severe mania when drunk (relapsing alcoholic)

I also have severe PTSD among others. He was arrested, I'm fully cooperating with local police and from my doctors, women's shelters.

118,148l4cq,Zombie Apocalypse,"Yes.  The title is absolutely sensationalistic, but that is how my brain works.  Sometimes in this struggle, we try to push down the parts of ourselves that make us shine.

This is an NSFW post that has been percolating in my head for almost the entire 25 years since I was first diagnosed.  It is my experience.  It is what I have learned about myself.  Things I wish I did differently and things I am proud of myself for surviving.

I chose the title because I have an irrational concern that I would not last long if we are faced with hoards of the undead.  While that fear is likely unfounded, how the world is going these days doesn't inspire confidence that what we face is much better.

The approach towards mental health has changed a lot since 1998.  Seeking help back then was generally seen as attention seeking behavior.  I was ashamed to talk to friends and terrified to tell my parents.

These were the really dark times for me.  I was on the cusp of turning 21.  If I wasn't trying to overcome a disturbingly low self-esteem through speed and sleeping with any guy who showed the slightest bit of interest, I was slowly increasing the depth I would cut at my wrist. (Classic attention seeking whore behavior at that time).

Around the time I was standing at 5'8"" and 114 pounds, I finally talked to my parents.  My father walked away and my mother asked if it was something they did.  Maybe asked isn't the right word, more pleaded with me to assure her it wasn't her fault.

And so I hid again.  I blamed myself for making them feel bad.  Pasted on a happy face when they were around.  Drank myself to sleep when they weren't.

Somewhere along the line, the term, ""chemical imbalance"" became all the rage.  When I tried to talk with my parents again, they had something to cling to.  It wasn't anything they did.  It was something wrong with me.  

If they could throw enough money at therapists and medication, they could convince themselves that they were ""helping"" me.  Financial help from my parents always seemed to come with a higher cost than a Vegas loan shark.

Perhaps my biggest problem at that time was a refusal to stay in therapy.  How could I talk to a stranger about a less than perfect childhood without acknowledging the role my parents played?  After all, this was a chemical imbalance so what could I possibly have to work through in therapy?

As the years went on, attempts at therapy became more and more pointless.  I didn't just hide my feelings from a therapist, I worked hard to hide them from myself.  

After a while, I started to doubt whether my memories were even true.  Did I make it all up to justify why I had so much trouble navigating the world?  

Meds got me to the point I could function enough in the world and I taught myself how to survive on that.  Isolation became solace.

A few weeks ago I ran into a major problem with my meds and have been forced to take a deeper look at myself.  

No.  Not myself.  I am fucking awesome.  I like who I have become!  I have been forced to take a deeper look at what led to my first psych visit in '98 and how it has led me to this place now.

Once again, my thoughts are based on my own experiences.  Don't ever let what anyone else says keep you from seeking help.  You are worth it.

Therapy:
I suck at therapy. I'm a conceited bitch who still believes I know more than the therapist. While this may be true for some I have met, I will admit I used the same rationale to ghost therapists who could have very muched helped.  I was too afraid to go down that road.

Meds:
I wish I had done more of my own research before taking anything.  And after many years trapped on Effexor, I wish there had been more info about long term use (obviously not possible for a newly released drug at the time).

I'm frustrated with the current state of mental health care that doesn't seem to provide a suitable amount of tests before putting people on meds.  And even if there are more tests, how many of us can actually afford them?

Once again, never let anything keep you from getting help.  If it helps keep you afloat DO IT.  Consequences be damned!

On those dark sleepless nights, when all you can do is hate everything about yourself, try to remember that there are thousands of things beyond your control that led you to this spot.

FWIW, I still haven't been able to do that for myself, but it sounds like damn good advice.",5,0

I was able to hold a job, manage my relationships, control all my manic episodes and coast pretty well through the depressive ones. However, following each of the two concussions i’ve had in the last 2 years. I have found that my symptoms seem less manageable, if not even worsened as a whole. It is not like they have been changing my meds a lot, I have been on the same dosages since January, but following my concussion in April, everything has seemed so much harder. I ended up losing my job due to taking a few days to heal from the concussion and since then have not been able to hold a job down. I was admitted to the psych ward for the first time a month ago.

127,148t845,Feeling like being under an emotional microscope,"I wanted to know if any one else feels like they are under an emotional microscope. I tend to feel like everyone can recognize my emotions and they think I’m crazy. My emotions may not have anything to do with being bipolar, nor are they out of proportion whatsoever, but I still feel judgement. They are also usually not noticeable by others unless I say something about it. There is no reason for me to believe, for the most point, people think I’m crazy. I still feel like I have to keep telling myself I’m not. When I’m in a depressive episode I feel constantly watched when I’m around others and they are plotting against me trying to make me unstable. When I’m manic, I withdraw from others too. I’m so worried that people will think I’m unreliable or not trustworthy. When I’ve had conflicts with roommates that had nothing to do with my illness, I was dismissed and nobody took responsibility for actions that were unprovoked and clearly disrespectful. They dismissed it and said I was bipolar. It’s not like I yelled at them or brought it up inappropriately. I have months of stability at least every year, but due o past experiences, I’m still worried all people think of me is crazy. 

I also feel scared and/or shameful now about telling people I have the illness because a lot of people have their own idea of what bipolar disorder is and often times it’s not a representation of my experience. For example, I haven’t had the agitation-like manias. I’m running all around the neighborhood nonstop excessively talking and laughing and having delusions and sometimes hallucinations. I can’t control my emotional reactions. Someone has told me that one of their family members died and I couldn’t stop laughing even though I didn’t find it funny. Either way, I hate telling people because I don’t like the assumptions and the way some people can come off as nice and accepting but the minute you bring up something they are doing that’s upsetting you and is disrespectful, they are quick to call you mentally ill to avoid all accountability. I worry about ever having a SO because of all the stigma, judgement, etc. It also kind of hurts seeing all the posts where people are struggling w their mentally I’ll partner. The last thing I ever want to be is a burden. I do everything I can to stay stable. I don’t drink or do drugs even caffeine. I take my meds and attend therapy actively. I hold my myself accountable for everything I can. I try to be as honest as possible. I just wish I didn’t have this illness. That’s it.

142,148i0en,Off my meds for two days and I feel TERRIBLE,"I take Latuda and Cymbalta as my main psych meds, plus gabapentin for chronic pain and Zofran for the nausea the Latuda causes. For the last five years I've taken my medications right before bed. I struggled a lot with going on and off meds when I was in my early twenties, and a ""keep it simple, stupid"" approach to taking meds at the same time every day has helped me stay consistent. It's been the stablest, in many ways the best, period of my life; I owe my life to these medications.

In the last few months I've been on and off my meds a few times. The first time wasn't really by choice - I had a month-long migraine attack and my nausea was so bad I threw up my meds several times and couldn't retake them. I noticed that on the days when I didn't have medications in my system, I was waking up much, much earlier. With the Latuda/Gabapentin/Cymbalta combo, I struggle to get out of bed before 10 a.m. Without it, I was waking up at 5:30 with my husband and dog. 

Sedation is one of those things I've just kind of gotten used to. I don't like it - it's really affected the kinds of jobs I can take, among other things - but better to be sedated than manic, right?

Well, on impulse a few days ago, I decided to try taking my meds in the morning rather than at night, to see if it would help with the sedation. But then... I didn't take my meds, because at first I liked how I was feeling. Now it's three days later and I feel fucking awful: restless, like I want to run away or blow up my life or get an awful tattoo or shave my head or cut myself etc etc. Classic signs of the mixed manic episodes I got before diagnosis. So I took my meds again this morning. I still feel awful, but I know they'll kick in eventually.

I guess I'm just sad that, in my thirties, with decades of experience with this disease, I am still going to struggle with the realities of what medication management does to my life. And I'm sad that I still sometimes struggle with not wanting to take my meds.

Saturday went to the beach and spent too much money, I used to live in that area and it all looked unfamiliar, I felt like I was in a weird dream, Sunday went out spent too much money, was very on edge. 

Yesterday no sun in the morning, I spend all morning crying because I feel very confused with severe derealization, couldn't remember any of the last few days.

Sun is out again, now I feel really strange- confused, feel like nothings real, racing thoughts, feel out of control, completely crazy, my own body doesn't feel like my own. I'm not on meds for bipolar as this was diagnosed by private psychiatrist and the mental health team I'm under isn't taking it seriously. I'm on mirtazapine 7.5mg at night and Ativan 1mg split into two doses. Underneath it all I'm very depressed and have become dependent on the Ativan(thanks to the doctors who prescribed it and kept telling me to take more of it to get me out the door). I'm scared of trying any new meds due to anxiety

What on earth can I do to stop losing my mind completely? I'm not sure if this is mania or extreme anxiety/depression/dpdr",2,0

I think I ruined my life. I don't know if I even feel love for the person who's been with me for over a year. He asked me why I've continued to tell him I love him, I said its because I want to, and I did. He asked me if I was just pretending, I don't have the answers to anything. Without him I don't have a place to live that I can afford on my own. I may have to drop out right before starting college. I don't feel anything about it really. 
I've been on medication, just antipsychotics, I haven't taken them in I think about two days which usually would mean I'd be a wreck. I don't think I'm a great person, and I don't know if I love the only person who may ever love me anymore. I honestly don't want to hurt him, I do care. But I can't really feel much now.

155,148cpte,Pre-diagnosed and scared,"I (35f) had an appointment yesterday with a therapist who told me I might suffer from bipolar disorder.
I have had a few depressive episodes for the past 10 years and since 2021 I have also experienced some symptoms that are consistent with the definition of mania. I have been on therapy regularly since 2020 and I have consulted a psychiatrist since 2021 who put me on quetiapine but while my therapist does not talk about a diagnose, the psychiatrist told me that these were mild mood changes and did not consist of bipolar.
The meds are okay and help me sleep, but did not prevent me from having both manic and depressive symptoms.
About 2 months ago i went to my general doctor because of a sinus infection and ended up crying in his office with a huge panick attack and opened up about how i was feeling mentally. He referred me to a therapist (both part of the national heath service - i am not in uk but in a country with a fairly good free and public health service). Yesterday i had my appointment and i mentioned a manic episode i had about 1 month ago - a burst of energy that lasted 5 days).
My final diagnose will probably come only in august when i will have an appointment with NHS psychiatrist but the therapist suggested bipolar disorder and although i feel like my intuition and symptoms are being validated, i am also scared. I am on work leave due to feeling miserable and i am worried my condition worsens and gets me in trouble. I have a wonderful, caring and understanding partner who is taking the load of caring for our house and 3 kids almost exclusively. 
I know i will get better with meds (doctor had me on sertraline as well) but i am really scared of telling my parents and friends about this. I feel like a huge failure, not living up to my full potential and just a disorganized mess. What was it like for you folks with a late diagnose and what can i do - small stuff - to make this a little easier? Thank you all so much",2,0

I have Bipolar 2 and after letting my doctor know I have been feeling (not hypomanic but) a little more up than usual he prescribed me with quietapine for the first time. He didn’t tell me to take a steady dose every day but only take a tablet when I couldn’t calm down or couldn’t sleep.

160,14830wo,I drew for the first time in 3 years!,"The last 3 years have been a lot for me mentally. I finished grad school, passed my board exams, had a baby, and started a new job straight out of maternity leave. I felt like I had lost all creativity and the ability to focus on anything that used to be mine. It was all about my son, my family, my job and just trying to hide the constant mixed/manic episodes. My husband would tell me that me that I’d feel so much better and less stressed if I went back to this hobby or he pleaded “any hobby”. He didn’t quite understand that every attempt I made to draw, paint, write, or anything creative was completely washed out of me because I was in constant survival mode masking my intense episodes so I could function for my family. It’s laughable to even say that, because to the outside world it might have looked like I was a very ambitious, driven and extremely productive person…those who knew me personally could see how bad the spiral was and they tried the best they could. I finally switched psychiatrists, after working together 10 years and although scary, it was the best move for me. I took a job that is structured, very positive culture, and honestly does stand by work/life balance. There’s no expectation to work outside of my contract hours plus my boss and coworkers are amazing. I found a female psychiatrist who was able to invest the time for hour long sessions rather than 15 minute med check-ins. She also has given me the acceptance and understanding that child birth really screws up a lot of us birthing people who are bipolar. I’ve always been bipolar 1 and I’ve had mixed episodes in the past. But as I was explaining to my new doctor, this has been the first time in since my son was born in which I have gone from severe ups to severe manic mixed episodes with only very brief periods of stability or depression. 

It’s been a really rough road but I feel like I’m thawing out and coming back to life. My skills may be rusty but I was able to freely draw: things I saw, things I made up, things that were silly, and things that were very just very random. I did it with relaxation. Nothing more. Just feeling calm and in the moment.

I’m proud that I’m starting to get back to me. I’m proud that I can look at some of my emotions now and not always jump to a good day is going to lead to mania, a bad day filled with anxiety and tears is going to be a mixed episode and that feeling down for a day or two is turning into a depressive episode—but rather, I’m entitled to good days, bad days, and everything in between. I used to know myself so well. My triggers, my patterns and I was 100% compliant and reliant on myself to follow my treatment plan. I was successful for almost 10 years.

It just feels better to feel ‘normal’, get back to what I love and give myself the compassion I deserve for the hell I went through.",8,0
161,14855ld,I am so broken,"Three weeks ago today, the love of my life ended things with me. This isn’t the first time either. In fact, it’s the third time. He says he’s too fucked up and unsure of himself to be in a relationship. He has good reasons which I don’t want to get into, but he also has promised me the world and told me over and over how he didn’t want to lose me for the past year. 

I thought we would make it. I had faith. We’ve been through so much. I feel so broken - not just because I miss him, but because I’ve never had any relationship where my partner actually follows through on the things they say. Where they stick around. Where I trust them when they say they value and love me. 

I know in time things will get better, but I have been so deeply unhappy since the on and off started at the end of February. I know I deserve better but I wanted him to be better.

162,147q2uh,Cheated during a bout of serious mania. Looking for words of encouragement/advice/comments or anything.,"Hopefully everyone can hear me out before rushing to judgment. I’m severely bipolar and have been dealing with the disorder since 2010. My wife and I have been together since 2013 and married since Oct. of 2018. Before we started dating I told her about my illness and all of the symptoms that come with it, including mania and psychosis. I tend to become manic during the holidays and start to recover in this spring. This season was the worst bout of mania I’ve ever experienced. A friend of mine lives in New York and invited me up for his birthday celebration. Drinking, drugs and situations of excitement severely impact mania. My wife and I have a 14 month old, our first child together. Getting out of the house for a night in the city was incredibly exciting. The first sign of real mania was me putting my card down for a $1,400 dinner tab. The second was binge drinking. The third was buying a VIP section in the club we went to, another $5,000. I live a comfortable life but in no way do I have any business spending that much money. The last sign was when I started to take drugs. Cocaine and Molly. Things I haven’t touched for a decade. By this time I was in complete psychosis. At some point I disappeared from the group and received oral sex from someone in the club. I don’t know the person and can hardly remember it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to multiple doctors to ensure I am clean after multiple tests for STDs. The only thing that holds me back from having peace of mind is the possibility of having HPV. It’s been since January 14th and I’ve been stuck. Do I tell her and risk ruining our marriage, her ability to trust me and probably anyone else, or risk breaking up our family and seeing my son grow up with a split household? We haven’t had sex since January 14th and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to touch her again. I know it’s wrong and no matter how bad I want to I can’t bring myself to do it. She is finally starting to ask why I haven’t touched her and I lied and told her it was my meds. Is this a dark secret I keep? Do I tell her? I have to think of my family. This isn’t just a post to tell me it is ok what I did. I feel shame, worthless and like I don’t deserve them. But I feel like they need me. And I certainly need them.",47,0
163,147trqh,First IV Ketamine Treatment,"For Context: I have been diagnosed with PTSD and BP-1 Disorder. I normally do sublingual tablets under the tongue for my ketamine treatments (prescription) that I do at my house. But as the anniversary of the PTSD-related trauma is happening this week, he referred me to do an IV ketamine infusion instead. I've also done nebulizer treatments with him. 

It was a completely different experience with ketamine in the IV treatment I've never experienced before when comparing to the nebulizer treatment and the sublingual tablets. There was an anesthesiologist on staff that talked to me before, we did a 40mg infusion, which I told him I didn't want to do anymore than that since he said he a low dosage of ketamine would most likely be more intense than what i've experienced before with other treatments. He was right...but it was in a good way.

It was the first time I was ever able to 'completely' dissociate away from reality, and was able to revisit the trauma surrounding my PTSD...but while I was under that 'spell' it felt like I was in a mentally safe space to be able to go back to some intense trauma-related emotions about it. Definitely cried (not like sobbing or anything out of control) during most of the treatment infusion time, which hasn't happened with me with the nebulizer or sublingual tablet treatments. The anesthesiologist checked in on me every 5 - 10 minutes to make sure I was staying calm, and to remind me I was in a safe space and that it was okay to cry. 

It already feels like a weight has been lifted off of my chest. I've been undergoing ketamine treatments for almost two years now through my psychiatrist, and it's been helping me tremendously on my mental health journey of feeling stable and not 'spiraling'; but again, today was the first time it was IV. 

Has anyone experienced doing different types of ketamine (prescription) treatments? Did you find the IV seemed to 'work' more? 

Just wanted to share a small part of my healing journey.

164,147pfj2,Wanting to be that person I was when I was hypomanic,"When I didn't know I was bipolar, I just thought I was ADHD, I started taking Vyvanse for ADHD and experienced a fundamental and radical change in who I was as a person. Like every self doubt I ever had washed away, I had an amazing elevated mood, I could focus very well because I was doing a lot of mindfulness, and I had amazing goal directed behavior. I didn't know that I was hypomanic at the time, and I just thought the Vyvanse had fundamentally changed who I was for the better. My identity fundamentally changed from this experience, and ever since then I find myself with ocd like compulsions to be that person again. Its like my identity/personality is wrapped up in who I was during that episode, but who I actually am can't fulfill that identity. I am having a hard time moving past this, even though my mood is now normal. My anxiety around this has improved a lot with CBT, and mindfulness.

169,147xurs,Is your brain this crazy? How to forgive and forget my past self,"Hey 


I’ve always had pretty low self esteem and my brain gets stuck in the past a lot. Like daily. My brain flashes back to the parts of me that were I was at my lowest. When my behavior was awful, cringe or plain sad I suffer from BPD, BP with major depression.  (I’ve been in therapy for 4 years & stable on meds for 2) 

My body was hit with a chronic pain disorder and it’s really awful. I couldn’t even walk for a few weeks. Somehow, I’ve made 2 dreams come true; become a full timer writer and financially support myself. 

As a disabled person it’s a miracle to be functional enough to work a full time job. another miracle that I can work remotely and that my salary is really good (unless you live in an over price city like New York. 🙋🏽‍♀️) 

Life is still hard but I’m really lucky, especially given my circumstances. 
But it’s so hard to be proud of myself and let the past go to the parts of my brain I don’t need to rewind to. I can’t emotionally connect with being proud of myself anymore. I can’t connect my gratitude for certain things to my actions. I’m grateful to have a roof over my head, but I can’t link that back to the positive ways I’m living my life. 

Yes, Life has been but there are things I’ve done that have made it harder. 

But the way every mistake I’ve made resurfaces is haunting. The scenes are more powerful than my ability to live in the moment. I want to change the way my brain operates and I don’t really know how. Affirmations and scripting has help me to have a base level amount of self respect and love. That’s pretty miraculous but I also don’t credit myself for the change, I say it happened because I refuse to be in constant pain and being disrespected by someone. 

I’ve had waves of it being easier to feel pride but it’s just until it the accomplishment become part of the mundane. 

I wonder what people without mental illnesses think about every day. 

Do they feel so overwhelmed by their thoughts?  Does speaking to people feels like a chore? 

I really want to be happy. Live in the moment, embodying the pride I should feel rather than shame.

Ive been in and out of mental wards 5x. Im in my early 20's I'm very introverted and socially awkward. 
I've always been told to be extroverted it will make you happy because humans are meant to make connections with others. 

Anytime I socialize I over share , I have 2 friends and I'm pretty sure they both hate me because 1 never responds the other just ghosts me. Said I was thinking about offing myself to 1 of them (havnt talked to this 1 friend since highschool just recently started talking and hung out 1x) I had a crush on them in highschool they are very aware of it but years after I see this person as a friend, nothing more. 

They said to go get therapy but I can't because I have no insurance, can't get a job because legally I can't drive due to double vision nor can my mom drop me off at any job because of her own job. 

I try to be social like going to a local fair we have every year but I have no friends and my mom won't go with me.

I have ADHD, Panic Disorder, BPD (I think it's autism because it doesn't happen unless I'm over stimulated) OCD, and insomnia.

Havnt seen a physician in 4 years so no telling what problems I have physically.

I forget to drink water and eat. My right kidney is in constant pain, severe migraine. I can't ask for help because my brother needs mental help and has asked for some help, I don't want to worry my mom and family because they think I'm doing so good and I'm happy. 

Truth is, I'm scared to be happy because for over 20 years , I'll be doing good in life, happy ect. Then shit hits the fan, rinse and repeat.
 
Don't want to be happy anymore I just want to die. My grandmother offed herself June 16 a few years ago. As little as I met her as a child around June I'm nothing but depressed and when I realize what month it is it hits different. I can't off myself because I know it would push a family member to drink again and I can't do that to them plus if I fail I'll be admitted back to the ward.

187,147wf02,How do you cope with the let down from a manic episode? (Content warning: self destructive behavior),"I’m sorry I’m not super familiar with the rules here, so if you are sensitive to talk about self destructive behavior, I’d suggest not reading on!!!

I’m 20 and I was diagnosed with Bipolar one about a year ago. I completely flipped out and cut off all of my family at the end of last may, and moved in with my boyfriends family. Granted, my family was terrible for my mental health, and in hindsight it seems to be the “right decision”. I was able to use mental health resources provided by my college last summer and during the fall semester because my boyfriends family was incredibly generous and helped me pay for classes. After about 6 months (December 2022) my boyfriend was kicked out for his own family issues. We moved in with my best friend at the time, and I was going through what I think was a manic episode for just under two months.  I was VERY unprepared for living on my own, and I don’t have money for insurance let alone to pay out of pocket for help, right now that is. With that being said I am completely unmedicated and never even had time to find anything that helped me. Life is getting really really hard. I was so hyper sexual and erratic It eventually led to me sending pictures and chatting online with strangers. I even made the awful mistake of flirting with a coworker way too much for someone in a committed relationship. I lost substantial amounts of money bc of spending sprees on things I most definitely shouldn’t have been buying. My boyfriend eventually found out about my unfaithfulness. We were able to talk things over and he forgives me and even understands how it happened… he’s truly my angel!! But goodness the guilt I have is unsurpassed. My self esteem was at rock bottom and I still feel so unworthy of love. Fast forward past 3-4 months of deep depression and the return of bad habits, I freaked out again. My friend who I was living with didn’t take care of her cat and would always leave the kitchen a rotting mess, and one day I got the idea to cut off my last friend. My bf and I moved out in less than a day, with no notice except for a passive aggressive note I left stating “I moved out btw <3”, ruining any chance of reconciliation. We had no where left to go, so his parents agreed to let us move back in with them two-three weeks ago. They know I am struggling and just want to help me… but I have developed some serious trust issues and im terrified to be around them alone. I was riding the high that got me into this mess up until about a week ago and I am spiraling out of control. The guilt I feel for everything I’ve done in the past year is debilitating, and I feel like I physically can’t trust anyone else to help me. I desperately need help coping with manic episode let downs, and how to overcome trust issues so that I can get the help I really do need.",5,0

190,147xfrm,How to have discipline,"For as long as I remember, I have had basically no discipline. I can tell myself that I will make a change and I can be good for maybe a month at max and then I fail. I can *never* tell myself no. *NO MATTER WHAT*.

I have ADHD as well and that just makes it feel impossible. I’ve been binging on fast food and soda every day. I’m indulging in my expensive hobby more than I should. I buy things whether I have the income for them or not.

My current bipolar meds really don’t seem to be helping and I haven’t had ADHD meds for months now. My most recent psychiatrist said I can’t get ADHD meds because I have to be drug-free to get prescribed them (despite already being clinically diagnosed). But how can I stop smoking weed when I am dopamine deprived? 

The first psychiatrist I had seemed to understand and diagnosed and prescribed me medication for ADHD. This made quitting weed cold turkey quite easy, but since the medication I was taking was on backorder for months, I fell right back into the cycle. So I ran out and now I cannot find the motivation to get more medication.

I think I am experiencing a mixed episode because I have felt some familiar manic irritation and have also been having a hard time doing most things. But the symptoms seem like they are mild and i cant shake my feelings of confusion. I feel like i am losing cognitive function. I seem to have barely any ability to articulate myself clearly and its so fucking frustrating because I cant explain or put my finger on why i feel the way i do. I have dealt with this numb feeling so long though that sometimes I think this is just how people are supposed to feel and I dont really have any issues. I am stuck in my head almost all minutes of the day. Constantly anxious about something going on in my life. I find no joy in ANYTHING.

197,147xtn0,Doctor thinks I'm bipolar this might be a long one,"Hello beautiful people!

As many of you, the second my doctor said anything to me, I immediately googled ""doctor thinks I'm bipolar reddit"" and ended up here. I'm gonna go ahead and apologize bc this will be a long one.

I'm a 33f, always been described as bouncy, fluffy and basically a hyper person. It's something managed and dealt with my whole life. I get extremely productive spikes and then will randomly just be an absolute goblin refusing to do even basic needs like taking a shower. 
I collect hobbies, diving into them feverishly, only to randomly lose all interest, allowing stuff to sit on a shelf never or rarely to be messed with again.
I will be the best, most attentive friend and then fall off the face of the earth.
I am incredibly spontaneous and will randomly just decided to take off for the day but at the same time panic about walking into a Lowe's because idk 🤷🏻‍♀️

These are all things I've managed. I've also had social anxiety, but it was mainly centered around new situations and would generally go away once I was actively in those moments. I found smoking the devil lettuce was also something I really only enjoyed doing by myself as it would spike my social anxiety around people.

However in Mar. 2023, I had three sicknesses back to back. Nothing major but enough to take it's toll, the last one being possible strep so I was put on amoxicillin. 

About day two into amoxicillin I was out in my garage, normal day, took a hit off a bowl (I've always been an extreme light weight so I stick to flower and maybe two hits is all I need) then went inside.

I suddenly had a massive breakdown. Extreme panic attack. Had to call my s/o to come home.

The next 2 weeks was a state of nothing but panic attacks. Constantly in the mornings. I could not escape my head. My thoughts were racing so fast that it made me feel like every second I was about to take off running. I felt absolutely out of my mind and yet paralyzed inside of it. Could not stop the panic attacks so went to my doctor. In that time I also entirely stopped smoking weed and drinking caffeine as it was proving to be a trigger. I still have not resumed either of those things.

At first she was sure it was a thyroid storm brought on by the sicknesses. However after three different blood tests, urine test and even a EKG everything came back... Fine. My thyroid was perfectly healthy. In that time she had put me on Propanol to lower my heart rate (as it was elevated when she saw me) and given Lorazepam for spikes (that stuff was wonderful at making me feel almost normal again but I avoided taking it unless absolutely necessary bc of potential for addiction) 

So she went on to give me stuff for a possible anxiety related illness. Continue Lorazepam only for spikes and wanted to start me on Lexapro (5mg as I am very small 104 pounds and previously all medications I've needed a lower dose) Lexapro was an absolute nightmare. I was back to the peak of the episode that started this whole thing. Stuck inside my head, mornings I was an absolute jittery mess on the edge of panic attack. I would have to get up 3 hours before I needed to leave the house because I'd spend 2 hrs laying in bed in an attempt to calm myself enough to just get ready for the day. Zero appetite, zero sex drive (least of my problems) extremely irritable. 

For some reason I convinced myself I was being dramatic and stuck it out for a week before I reached out to my doctor who immediately said I needed to stop taking it. 

Within 4 days things leveled back out, I still don't feel like who I was before this whole thing started. For context I was VERY happy. I had, in the passed two years, finally fell in love with.myself. I enjoyed who I was, was very confident in myself and loved life. I barely had any sort of anxiety. Now I no longer can have coffee, can smoke to relieve stress (those two really are just kind of sad not my main issues) I live with anxiety every single day. The mornings still being the worst part of it. But no longer spiraling like I was at the beginning of this or on the Lexapro. 

Once things leveled, my doctor had me answer a bunch of questions. She even said she was so surprised bc at the start of this she could of swore it was just a thyroid storm. However I never really had told her about any of my daily issues, bc before this, they really were not something that bothered me. I loved when I became wildly productive and yes it did suck when I'd suddenly lose it half way through some random project but I managed. After speaking she has stated she believes i could be bipolar and asked if id be comfortable trying medication for it. 

I have to admit, after the Lexapro I am very very apprehensive. It took me right back to when this whole ordeal started and it was terrifying. Every day felt like a month and I was physically fighting it felt like just to do basic tasks. But I also know that whatever started all this wasn't medication and could happen again. I just want to be back to the person I was before all this, if that's even possible. 

I guess I am attempting to see if my experience matches any of you here. I must admit I don't know very much about bi polar and if any of this are things you've all dealt with. I'm looking for information, I haven't given my doctor a yes or no yet. As of right now I am ""ok"" (again not who I was before all this still very low energy, higher anxiety and just not myself) but I worry about doing nothing. Any advice or insight on this absolute girthy tale is going to be VERY appreciated.

201,147zbxl,How do you stay grounded during psychosis?,"Tl;dr: what healthy coping mechanisms do you like to do to keep yourself grounded when you are feeling psychotic or in a highly manic state?

Hi everyone, I am currently awaiting a diagnostic interview this week with my therapist but her, myself, and my family think I may have Bipolar I with psychosis. I am between meds because the last one was giving me heart arrhythmia and the pharmacy won't have the new one until tomorrow so I am just sitting here trying to keep myself level-headed as the mania symptoms return. 

The thought disorganization is getting really bad and I'm growing increasingly worried about the weird delusions returning. How I am feeling physically, cognitively, or emotionally changes so quickly it's hard to feel settled. I thankfully have a great support system here with my family and therapist (my psychiatrist is kinda so-so, but whatever) so I do feel safe.  However, every step of this has been about dealing with new sensations and cognitive contortions that I would love to know what you fellow sufferers of Bipolar Disorder do to cope in the moment when the mania is overwhelming.

Will I with someone get an obsession?

Basically I’ve been on two big stressful international trips the past two weeks, which my psychiatrist strongly cautioned against (not going was not an option). So I knew this would have some effect on me since travel is one of my triggers, but I have no idea what is going on right now. I was in a medium depressive episode before leaving, which has felt a bit exacerbated since beginning the trip. But after a few days I started to get very disoriented, having a hard time hearing/understanding what people are saying when they speak to me, sleeping all the time and even sleeping through my alarms which I’ve never done before. I think I had one small visual hallucination but still am not sure. This got a bit more extreme at the worst possible time when I was going through an airport to get to the second part of my trip. I was overtaken by what felt like extreme fear and confusion and couldn’t understand what was going on around me or what people were saying, and I could tell that no one could understand me either. I remember feeling trapped in my head and thinking that I wanted to go to the hospital except not in the country I was currently in. This went away after a few hours but I was completely freaking out. I even listened to a voice note I sent to someone and can hear that my voice was very weird and slow.

I’m also not manic. It’s something new, and right now I’m in one. Nothing bothers me, because nothing matters. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this.

223,147i6pa,Recurring mania,"Hi everyone! So this is my first time uploading on this subreddit but, I have something to ask to others with bipolar more specifically ones who are more often in manic/hypomanic episodes, I have extremely rapid cycling bipolar 1 and this year in 2023 I've so far had about 6 manic episodes... yep, it sounds a bit unbelievable even I don't believe it but I look back of all the symptoms of whenever it happens it most definitely is mania, but okay so one of my more specific ways I can mania is actually there is I begin to actually starve myself unintentionally and I get physically repulsed by all food, even if I try to eat it it tastes so bland to me that it makes me lose my appetite even more and this usually happens for about a week and then it ends and I eat like normal and my mood is normal... I usually try to calm the mania and unintentional starvation down with weed and when I run out the mania returns and it's just another vicious cycle... I hope this story isn't all over the place it's kind of hard trying to catch my grip on my thoughts while writing this but yes, I'd like to know if anyone else has that warning sign to mania.",2,0

231,1478bqi,Anyone in a successful relationship with someone who has bipolar?,"A while back I made a depressing post about if I’ll ever find someone due to my Bipolar 2. Within it I explained in great detail about why I was thinking that way due to my struggles, realizations, growing points, and not to mention I keep seeing a lot of failed relationship stories too.

All I’ve ever wanted was to find that one person who just seamlessly fits into my life. I want to find that forever person who I truly am happy with and can be myself around. I’m just scared I’ll never find that again. Within my post I explained why I think I could hopefully find it though due to my growth as an individual. 🥲

I’ve been *so f’in depressed* lately and just want to hear some inspiring stories about others being in a healthy, *long term,* committed relationship with someone who has bipolar. 

I want to hear from individuals who’ve been together for years and years and years, not from people in 2 or 3 year relationships. I’m looking for lifelong and want to hear from those who are in those relationships because of this.

*For added context:* I don’t settle, I have standards, so I’m very picky with who I let into my life and why it takes me a decent chunk of time to find someone between relationships. I know some people with bipolar have a tendency to jump but that’s not me.

233,1479olq,Diagnosis and self harm,"Hi. To start out with I’m a 24 year old gay male, who has had slight behavioral and mood problems since my mid teen years. Lots of issues at home as a kid, psychological and physically abusive step parents you know? 
Well my issues continued to get more and more frequent as an adult. Then when July hit last year, everything in my life absolutely blew up. I stopped sleeping, eating, caring about the state of my home. Calling off work frequently to the point I almost lost my job. Had black outs in memory, to the extent where I “woke up” on the ground in a corn field in the middle of a small thunderstorm. I had drove my car 7 miles away from home and parked on the side of the road near the field and walked through one of the plow lanes and fell back. I don’t know how long I was there. I don’t remember driving there or walking through the fields. I started hearing things, at home and at work. People calling my name when nobody was around, I heard my grandma talking to me. And she’s been dead for 12 years. Then it got to the point of hallucinations. Then I’d start to see my grandma, and the worst part was when I walked into my house and saw my stepfather running at me fist raised. He had been dead a year at that point and I hadn’t seen him in 9. Along with those I was seeing people in the darkness, watching me wherever I went. In the shadows of my house and at work. And at times it’d be like I had a United Nations Council going on in my head with so much talking I couldn’t comprehend it. And other times it would only be 4 or 5 voices at a time, and they would all sound like me, but they’d all say different things and it was like all the different parts of me were telling me what to do. As a result, one day when my head was splitting from all the congestion and screaming I took one of the things I was working on at work (I’m a welder), and pressed it deep into the exposed flesh under my PPE. That started to make things easier, it hurt so much I was able to focus on that instead of the circus I was seeing and hearing. So that’s what I kept on doing. Now despite this, I knew everything I was seeing and hearing wasn’t real. I knew my grandma and stepfather were dead. I knew the shadow people I kept seeing weren’t real. But the burning was the only way to help. There would be periods of time where I’d be okay, I wouldn’t sleep but I wouldn’t be tired. And then I’d start sleeping with any and all men who would have me without a second thought. That lead to me being sexually assaulted and almost killed at the hands of a dangerous man. But despite that I’d continue. I maxed out my credit cards within a month and was $10,000 in debt. I’d spend paychecks on things I didn’t need and then couldn’t pay my bills. And I started drinking more frequently, but not enough to where I’d be considered an alcoholic. I put myself in more dangerous situations. Speeding 20-40 miles over the limit, passing cars with cars approaching closely on the other side, trespassing on the stone quarry near my house, trying to climb the water tower near my house (and failing because it was raining and I kept slipping), wearing my headphones with loud music and my eyes closed on highly trafficked train tracks. 
Finally one day one of my coworkers was messing with me to the point where I thought I was hallucinating again. And it got to the point where I ran from work without a word to anyone. I went to the mental health clinic at my home town which was 12 miles away. After filling out the paperwork it took 3 weeks to get in with a clinical psychologist. When I did I told her everything, it took 4 sessions over a month to get everything in the air. 
My friends and family were unaware of the self harm. But they all agreed that at that time the psychologist should have had me hospitalized. 
She got me set up with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, who diagnosed me with Bipolar 1 with acute mania and psychotic disorder after reading everything in my chart and talking with me. And after my diagnose, my mother revealed that she received the same diagnoses after a suicide attempt 7 years past when she was in a psychiatric facility. She said based on her mother and her grandmother’s life and behavior they likely had the same. 

So my reason for posting is, do you agree that my first psychologist should have taken 
extreme measures for hospitalization?",4,0

Also, my eating diorder doesn't let me take anything that might cause weight gain (and I have already developed insulin resistance due to 6 years of anorexia and 2 years of binge eating, so it is difficult to manage my weight in a healthy way as it is - currently I am at a healthy BMI and I am hoping to stay in this range).  


But I feel like it is starting to get to the point where I am just so so angry that I am not living up to my potential due to these illnesses, cannot take challenges I would like to because I cannot bear the emotional burden and lack the confidence to do so.

Also, depressive episodes are crippling and the whole thing is rapid cycling, it is making me exhausted mentally and physically.

Hello, so I was diagnosed bipolar 1 when I was 20 years old. It took a long time to find the right medications and going through treatment before I felt stable. I also come from an incredibly unstable household. When I was around 24, I started to reject my diagnosis, I felt bitter about it given that it seemed like the problem was everyone else in my family. I hated the way they treated me over the years when it was clear to me they were the ones who need the most help. I was in an accident that gave me a concussion and shortly after healing I made the decision to stop my meds and seeing a psychiatrist. I felt I was sick and tired of feeling like my head was being fucked with and I was just in miserable circumstances. I loathed myself and the diagnosis which didn’t match up with the image I had of myself. I used all the coping skills I was taught in therapy and I graduated college and found a job and pushed through the pandemic. Except, now at 27 I’m spiraling again. All the classic symptoms are back and I’ve hit an all time low, I feel so stupid and guilty for feeling this way and for having stopped my treatment in the past. So  I just started my meds again after an ER visit for suicidal ideations. I forgot how hard it can be to adjust to it all. I feel so lost.",5,0

274,146r73x,Butterflies in stomach - early sign of manic episode???,"Okay so I'm quite new to bipolar disorder symptoms, I honestly didn't know how serious this illness is.. I was ""diagnosed"" with borderline personality disorder before I turned 18 and it seemed legit, it helped me understand how my mind works, what triggers me and why, etc. 

But the past few months I realised that even though I'm mostly in a depressed state since I was a child, I often make a 180° turn and become especially confident and productive, I need less sleep, become more sexual, take risks, and overall I just try to live life to the fullest. Then I fall back into depression, sometimes without a reason, and then the good times seem like a lie to me. 

I never noticed this pattern before, but now at the beginning of this year I had a clearly manic episode (which then turned into psychosis) and I'm trying to put the pieces together. Looking back, one of the first signs of the starting mania was this feeling of ""butterflies"" in my belly. It's mostly a nice but overwhelming feeling in my lower stomach & private area. I was turned on 24/7 and no amount of masturbation / sex made it disappear. This time it's a little different because even when I'm not turned on it feels as if I am because of these ""butterflies"". 

I am really afraid that it's an early sign that I will spiral into another episode and maybe go into psychosis again. 

I started going to therapy but had to stop because I can't afford it right now. If I want to get free healthcare I have to wait 1-2 years. I would check into mental hospital if things get worse but I have two kids with no help, so that's not really an option. 

Is there any option to stop an upcoming manic episode other than medication? Please help me, I'm so scared. I made really dumb things the last time and I don't want to ruin my life any more.

I had 5 years history of GAD, depression for which i took 25 Zoloft, and some hypomanic episodes that no one took seriously until i got filmed how was behaving and described my psychiatrist how i was feeling.

 Last winter i had my first true major depression episode and they pumped me with 100 Zoloft. I went mad, anxious and furious with a sensation that i have something eating at me from the inside. She told me to wait at least 4-6 weeks and so i did but my symptoms were getting worse, not better as she said so i stopped it on my own and went finding another doctor

At first she thought too it was depression and anxiety. She tried 2 times (first with 25mg of zoloft and got agitated, then with 10mg of vortioxetine because i was depressed, both drove me mad) then she diagnosed me with BP 2 Something changed in my brain when i got pumped with 100 of zoloft. Before i could tolerate antidepressants.Not anymore. I have some questions

1.The last 3 days i felt so depressed that i sat nearly all day crying something in bed, but today i feel anxious again, but still anhedonic and cant eat. Can this happen or is it just cyclothimia or maybe a mixed episode? I read about this online
2. What is fast cycling, means i can feel better some days and then feel very depressed another day?I mostly am depressed that is why for the last 2 months they tried antidepressants
My doctor said she doesnt give antidepressants to people with agitated depression(maybe she wanted to say bipolar without me knowing?)
3. What are your experiences with bp
and what meds are you taking. I take 600mg of Seroquel xr, 100 lamotrigine,500 valproic acid and  benzos(mainly before i go to sleep), alprazolam and clonazepam

My friendships since high school (I’m now 25) have always been really tumultuous - either because I overestimate the care others have for me/too trusting and I end up getting hurt and taken advantage of, or I sabotage the friendship in an effort to protect myself if I perceive any possible psychological danger to myself….

This response I think is partly shaped by my trauma but I think mostly because of how my brain works. I feel big things all the time and some of those are fear and pain.

Im 26, had depressive episodes through out my whole life, got diagnosed with ADHD at 23yo and 2 years ago after a really bad hypomania (cheating, maxing out credit cards, drug abuse) I got diagnosed bipolar at 24yo. Both runs on both sides of my family so…. 
Me and my SO went through a really rough fase trying to repair all the damage I’ve done. We are doing a lot better now. 
I know the disorder is not responsible for everything I’ve done, now that I’m diagnosed I realise how I’ve could’ve tried to avoid/control it. 
Since then I’ve been taking lamotrigine, latuda and going to weekly therapy sessions, which are keeping me stable. I’m very aware of symptoms now.
The whole healing process after my hypomania gave me traumas, things were said and cant be taken back, some wounds are still healing, and thats ok. But every now and then when we have occasional conversations about things that happened he freaks out.
Every single time my diagnoses comes up my SO tries to invalidate my symptoms. He always begs me to be open and communicate about any issues I might be having with my mental health, but when I confide in him and bring up some symptoms I’m struggling with he dismisses it saying thats not the disorder, I’m just a bad person trying to justify bad things I’ve done.

This kills me. The stability came at very hard work and not being able to confide in my partner without getting invalidated its so discouraging. 
I’ll never hurt him again, I’m doing everything I can to ensure that, I love him.

Im 20, ive been in the mental health hell loop since 12/13 in offices but ive always struggled. Adopted mother used substances while in utero. My psychiatrist suspects im bipolar, has it on my chart with cptsd+anxiety; however, i dont feel like i am “sick enough” to have a genuine issue besides a fragile personality. Everything feels like how people normally live life but i dont know. Psych said (kindly) i am different and have a chemical imbalance. I feel like a fake, people genuinely struggle while i dont feel like i struggle enough. I undercut myself like that but its not like i can forget the years of inner turbulence, attempts, hospitalizations, or the scars i have. I dont feel like i suffer enough as i dont have frequent attempts, life wrecking decisions, and slightly gotten life together. Since i am still alive off meds its even more reason in my head that i am jus weak and alright. Meds made me lose my sense of self and constant inner dialogue. Family tolerates and treats me slightly better on meds, didnt know when i was off for months secretly as i can control my show of emotions well until the last crumb of me is devoured. Emotion showing is never good here. I plan of talking to my therapist about me being a fake but i had to jus get it out.",3,0

I’m back working now, but I’m struggling with concentration and getting feelings of rejection from friends based off of nothing at all. In fact they’re constantly validating me at the moment. Then on the flip side I’ve picked up like 3 new hobbies fairly intensely, am moving house at the end of the month and planning a wedding for October. I’m losing quite a lot of weight too, which was needed, and have a heart health scare ongoing. Like, I know I’m going to be fine, but I just feel so on edge. The medications have kept me stable for so long, and therapy got me to a really good place when I stopped a year ago.

Recently I think I was manic for the first time after having developed CFS but since I have no bodily energy or a low ability to move it was a very strange experience. My mind was busy and racing but my body can’t do anything to expend the energy. Which is a good thing to avoid negative behaviors but also felt like being trapped in a way!

Sometimes a bit slips out, I feel like I have the plague and if I sniffle once suddenly I’m a freak show or a bratty kid. I’m really struggling with new management at my job. For context I work at a very chill and open minded small business, it’s a job I used to really enjoy. My old manager and me are extremely close and his wife has a mood disorder. With him I felt very connected and in the loop with my other managers and higher ups. New manager is the complete opposite, didn’t even know what manic meant. For about a month I was on the wrong meds and went through a mixed mania phase, now I feel like anything I have to say is ignored or dismissed as me just being the resident nut job. That shift has been extremely hard for me, my boss doesn’t like me as much, I’m written up far more, chastised for small mistakes, and am pulled aside for meetings that feel like I’m a child being scolded. All while feeling out of the loop with the rest of management. I do not feel comfortable telling upper management that I’m in a depressive or manic state to request shifts in work load, not being able to tell anyone to get accommodations has made me dislike a job that once made me extremely happy. I understand I’ll have to work until I’m dead, work is awful, and any tolerable work is good work but good damn going from being open about my struggles and getting support to being treated like a child is really fucking with me. I don’t want to quit cause I know everything else is worse or the same, I’m paid liveable wage, and I like the job and staff. I’m really considering trying to work for myself but I don’t have faith I could be consistent in it.

Every part of my life is like this. I try so so so so so so hard to be normal, but if I react moderately poorly to something even around people who struggle with anxiety and depression I’m shunned and treated like a bratty kid. I’m tired of being a problem, I’m tired of not being normal, I’m tired of not wanting to have friends cause I’m afraid of people leaving to tell everyone I’m crazy, and I’m tired of hiding every bad thing that’s eating my brain. 

I don’t understand why I can’t be normal it’s so extremely frustrating, I can’t even fix it I’m just stuck like this all cause someone was cruel to 5 year old me. I’m just stuck with this, I’m always gonna be the freak show. It makes me so sad.",7,0

Not even the lines from my mouth are my own

Born pigeon toed with an inability to hold my calories

Wailing and storming with a family home of gasoline

Doused for anything deemed weak—a stutter and tripping evaporates confidence

I’m not my own—baptized with mania as a teen, sticking fingers down my throat

Hopping on planes—looking for an exclave—my family knocked me out the herd for too bing too feminine

321,1463e5f,I’m finally starting to make some progress!,"I think I’ve only posted here once before. 
I was diagnosed with Bipolar 13 years ago. (I’m about to turn 26.) It has been a constant struggle to get reliable, consistent treatment. 

Last year, I started using Brave Health for my therapy/psychiatric needs. At the time, it didn’t cost anything because I was dirt poor and had insurance through the state of FL. 
I moved back to NY in November of ‘22. My therapist and psychiatrist were not licensed in NY, so they paired me with a psychiatrist who is licensed in NY, and put me on a wait-list for a therapist. I got new insurance through my employer, and updated the organization with this information. 

I felt like I was being jerked around by this new psychiatrist. She wouldn’t take me seriously. I was prescribed Aripiprazole and Hydroxyzine, which was an okay combination. I told her that it was helping, but at such a low dose, it wasn’t having any major effect. Instead of trying to increase the dose, she switched me to Latuda and Buspar, which was a terrible combination that made my symptoms worse. 
On top of that, nobody ever bothered to tell me that the organization does not accept my insurance, and I was being charged (unknowingly) upwards of $100/session. 

I have since stopped utilizing their services and I contacted my DO, who took over prescribing. She put me back on the original combo until I can get in to see a local mental health provider. 

I ALSO LEARNED that my thyroid levels are wayyyy off, which has a great impact on my mental health. For background, I had hyperthyroidism (diagnosed at 15?) and had a total thyroidectomy in 2017. I’ve been on Levothyroxine since then, but somehow my TSH levels got to 129.0 in January. (Normal range, according to provider is .27-4.2) 
I followed up with my endocrinologist, who made some medication adjustments and set dietary restrictions. 

I finally feel like we’re starting to get somewhere with treatment. I’m taking baby steps, but at least I’m heading in the right direction!",9,0

330,14652ec,How can i make life easier for my partner as someone with Bipolar?,"Hi! 

I am 24F and bipolar. I’ve been diagnosed three years ago, it’s been rough but I’m on meds and try to have a routine. I have very sharp mood swings throughout the day and I always feel ‘too much’.

I’ve been together with my bf(24M) for almost 2 years now. He has ADHD and derealization. We actually clicked because we were both struggling with the concept of reality since I’ve been having hallucinations that time. We help each other out. When we started dating, I wasn’t that bad with mood swings but throughout the year I got worse. He is so helpful, so nice and so understanding. He manages everything so well. But he says I usually confuse him because my mood changes so drastically and he doesn’t know what to do sometimes. I got sad over this and he said ‘It’s okay, u know I love challenges. Maintaining u is challenging but fun. I love to help’. He was so nice again. But what if one day he’ll say ‘It’s too much’ and leave? For example a few nights ago I asked him ‘What is a question u would like me to ask u frequently?’. He said ‘I would like it if u sometimes asked -would u like me to leave u alone?-. Bcuz sometimes I’m busy but I don’t want u to feel lonely or neglected so I make time for u but it prevents me from working since concentrating is hard for me’. I am gonna work on this. 

I am in a phase where I don’t really know myself if that makes sense. I can’t tell when I feel or think something if it’s bipolar or me genuinely. It’s hard as I don’t remember past very well. I don’t know who I was and I don’t know who I am. Sometimes it’s too much so I just go walk around for a few hours and he gets worried. I tell him where I am and when will I go home but he still feels uncomfortable. 

We have a healthy relationship, we never fight or hurt each other, we are best friends. I want to marry this guy, I want to be the best version of myself for him. We work in the same industry(game) and we have lots of fun. 

So my question is how can I help him and my relationship in general? Do u have any tips? And if u also have ADHD, what would u like ur partner to do about that?",5,0

But now I find myself becoming depressed when I have nothing to do. Plus due to my depression, I don't feel like traveling or going out because I know I won't enjoy myself or would want to go home early.

I'm stuck in this weird stage where I can't do my hobbies. I either can't focus or I have lost interest in them. For example, it's hard to me to watch TV or movies. I get so restless. I find it virtually impossible to read books, novels, or even short stories as if I have a brain fog. I also find my other hobbies to be boring.

All day long I basically do nothing, only looking forward to bedtime.

My psychiatrist thinks the focus part might be due to executive dysfunction and possibly ADHD. In a little over of a week from now, I will get tested for it. I hope all I need is just a medication adjustment or a new med. Speaking of meds, my psychiatrist prescribed me Seroquel. They told me it should also help me with the med.

334,1462072,Bipolar Coping Strategies,"Hi! It’s my first time on the bipolar subreddit because I was looking for a place to ask a question or two and share what’s been going on. I have bipolar depression and it’s taken a toll on my mental health for many years now, but it’s getting a lot better! I was taking a medication for it and seeing a therapist, although I have since lost that form of insurance. I’m still currently looking into treatments but I’m waiting for my insurance to switch over so it’ll be covered again. 

Anyhow, I’m trying my best to deal with it and haven’t had any significant mood swings in a while, however, last night my boyfriend and I were painting when I started to become a little more reserved. It’s hard for me to explain what I’m feeling during those times other than “low” or “low energy”. I just want to exist and not make many decisions during that time and be on autopilot. But it’s also very difficult for him because it makes him think I’m upset with him. Admittedly, I’ve had and sometimes continue to struggle with telling my partner when I’m upset and I’ll wait a few hours before I do instead of telling him as it happens. But because of this, it makes him think I’m upset with him when I’m depressed. This morning it really hurt his feelings and it made me a little frustrated since I’m still feeling gross. I know his feelings are valid and I want him to realize my mood has nothing to do with him and I still want to spend time with him during that time, but I’m just on low battery mode until it goes away in a bit. Part of me feels like I’m being unfair because his feelings are warranted but I also feel like crap because I can’t help how I get during those times. 

Anyhow, I was looking at articles to see if there were better coping strategies for me during that time and I found a lot of helping resources for dealing with a bipolar partner, but I’m currently trying to find something on how to support and reassure your partner when you’re going through an episode. Being talkative just makes me feel worse and I don’t know if I can force it, but I want to find something to show him that shows I care and do want to help him as well. I really love him and don’t want to hurt him like this. Any helpful articles of coping strategies are extremely welcome and thank you to whoever took their time reading this! Have a great day!",4,0

I also have father/trauma  issues which might contribute to my being nervous around men more than women. 

Anyway, they want me to go to a comedy club with them. It'll be dark inside the club, they'll be laughs, drinks, fun. They want me to get out the house. I think my sister worries about me staying inside all the time and her boyfriend as well. 

I'd rather stay home and babysit my nephew and sigh in peace at being alone. (My nephew is six and it is surprisingly way less exhausting being just with him.) 

I do not want to go. I'm desperate not to go. I'm scared to be around my sister's boyfriend. He's a really great guy and has given me no reason to be afraid or nervous around him. And, I really, really like him for my sister. I don't want to appear like I don't like him by being standoffish.

But I don't feel like being in a social situation that might be awkward. I might do or say weird things I don't mean to do, because sometimes I'm unsure how to respond well in social situations. I'm terrified of that happening. I have to copy other people and what they might say or do, and I don't do that well. Sometimes it comes out wrong.

So, I have a plan. I could let my mom do my hair and join them for the comedy club. Maybe  have some fun, interact with my sisters boyfriend and maybe it won't be so bad. 

OR: I could call my mom and tell her to come by later at 6pm and take as long as she likes doing my hair so I can miss going to the comedy club. I'll tell her I have things to do and can only get it done at 6pm. (She's braiding my hair and it does take awhile but not THAT long) 

A part of me feels like because I feel so afraid of going, that maybe I should try to make myself go. That I'll always be afraid if I don't push myself, and I shouldn't live life that way. 

Any advice?",3,0

I (33f) am currently on the following meds:

75mg Zoloft (was 100mg…)
100mg Lamictal
40mg Latuda

Last week friday, my psychiatrist started to decrease my Zoloft. Throughout the days following the initial decrease, I started to have adverse side effects; brain zaps, tingling on the left side of my, etc. The brain zaps got so intense that I ended up in the ER.

They ran a bunch of tests like chest x-ray, blood work, and 3 different MRI’s.

Once my results were back, I was told that my symptoms were due to Zoloft decrease, and they are happy that I came in, as they MRI found an umruptured 5mm aneurysm in my brain. It is small enough that it did not require immediate surgery, so they sent me home with instructions on how to contact a neurologist & neurosurgeon near me.

With all that being said, I was also diagnosed with: bipolar II, ocd, adhd, ptsd, bed, and bpd traits at the beginning of this year. I can’t help but obsess over thinking that stress from all my illnesses caused this.

I am feeling the absolute lowest that I’ve ever felt in my life. All I can think about is that life is not fair & that I don’t want to be here anymore.

376,145bq1n,I’ve had a very sad thought last night — I think I’m fated to loneliness.,"Last night I was thinking of this guy I met last time I was hospitalized.

He was from the drug abuse division, but we started interacting and got closer. 

We planned to see each other outside. But I left before him and I talked here, with friends, a relative, and everybody told me that I shouldn’t get involved with someone who is a drug abuser. 

So I distanced myself and kinda stopped replying to him. 

But last night he came to mind and I wondered if he’s okay. He’s disappeared from social media for a while now and I checked his mother and she posted something about this place where people go for treatment. Can’t know for sure if he’s there. 

Anyways, that made me think that I couldn’t be with him because I know he can get violent — he told me he punched a wall and broke his hands to not punch his partner, prior to that hospitalization.

That’s really scary and I feel like I would be afraid to sleep with him and maybe one day I wake up with him punching me. A person here shared a story like that with me.

Then I had realized that it can and will probably happen to me as well.

Who would be comfortable knowing that “anytime” I can flip and turn into a person completely lost from reality, and who has no control over their actions? 

I feel like no one sane enough would play this bet. So, now, I’m thinking I’ll just die alone and that sounds so sad. 

I see old men on dating apps and I don’t want to be like that. I want to have someone to share life with. 😔",15,0

378,145jx9w,Sometimes I wish people could see it when they looked at me,"I'm sure it wouldn't improve things all around. I'm sure some people would avoid me on sight if they could tell. Maybe even some would be violent.

But at least then more people could understand. They wouldn't forget. When I'm stuck in my house for weeks, not answering my phone- they'd know it wasn't just me avoiding them.

When I drop out of school again, it's not just me being lazy or not wanting it enough.

I'm not some loser refusing to get along in society. Or a great visionary who aims to trailblaze a new radical way of living. 

It's just this thing in my head that's imperceptible to the naked eye. It can't be picked up on a blood test, or displayed in a scan. It's quiet most of the time, and gets forgotten.

It doesn’t seem to matter if I’m stable, manic or depressed, the food aversion remains. I’ve been on 4 different meds since I was diagnosed 8 months ago and each time my doctor says “hopefully as you level out the appetite will improve.” I haven’t experienced an improvement yet. Some drugs have slowed my weight loss, but none have caused me to gain weight or even stop losing. I’ve lost over 50 pounds in the last year or so and I feel weak. I can tell I’m not getting enough to eat, but I don’t know how to stop feeling viscerally disgusted by food.

Hi Folks,

I am so glad i found this subreddit. Makes me feel less alone. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline in 2020. I have been on 200mg quetiapine for a long time. (3 years ago it was 450mg and we were planning on gradually reducing it further, but my doctor after 3 years disappeared into thin air without notifying me beforehand). The last 3 years have been the most stable and fulfilling time of my life. I learnt how to be alone, stopped getting into abusive relationships, finished my degree, started becoming successful with making films (which had been my big dream since i was a child), held down a job with reasonable pay, etc. But in March, my doctor disappeared and i also got diagnosed with insulin resistance, which could have developed as a side effect of quetiapine. So i went to the hospital for a month to set my meds and to take part in a CBT group. It was nice, but the doctors there didn't really believe my diagnosis from 3 years ago, they said I'm ""only"" borderline.. And we reduced the meds to 0. 

But I am getting weird. Everything feels funny, i lose sense of time often.. And i think I may have stepped over someone's boundaries this morning. I just had a conversation with a person in an elevator. It felt good. Unfortunately, i took my efforts to track them down (we did not share any contact, all i knew was that live in the same building, but I used all my creativity and resources to find out where they live) successfully in 1 hour, and i asked them if they want to talk. Of course this pushed them away. I mean i think they got creeped out.

I feel ashamed and i wish i hadn't done it. I don't want to scare people. I don't want to step over boundaries. 

(I'm 25F and i reallyreallyreallly just wanted to talk again to the person who was a woman whom i felt i could really related to.)

I feel, think and act weird. This is not the me i've spent the last 3 years with. 

I feel everything and nothing at the same time, all the time. Everything looks and smells nice. I wish i could just spend the whole day looking at the clouds and the flowers without having to eat, sleep, work, etc.. It feels ""fun"", but not the type of ""fun"" i should be having. I forget to close the door of my apartment.. I forget where i put my stuff.. Losing track of days,.. Time.. Not cool.. 

Oh, and my sleep quality is the worst. I wake up too early, and i can't go back to sleep after that. 

I feel like a machine that just simply can't be turned off.

411,145f4l4,Just need to share my feelings about a sibling. We are both bipolar.,"This might be a long post but I really just need to get it off my chest.

My sibling (non binary) has been tormenting me since I was born. There are probably a lot of different diagnosis that would fit them and I wouldn't be surprised if they have BPD as well.

They are 4 years older and when they heard they were going to get a sister they didn't want me because they wanted a brother. I have bee unwanted by this individual that has existed in my life for 20+ years since before I was even born. When we were young it was a lot of fighting that sometimes would get physical. Once when I was 5-6 years old they put their hands around my throat and my side of the story is that I was being choked. My sibling has always and will always deny this fact and I honestly can't remember much from when I was younger so I don't know myself. I just know that to this day it is something that I remember as traumatic. It could be that my brain at that age made it out to be a scarier situation than it really was. My parents got very worried and was ofc upset with my sibling that has been upset with me since then for telling them that.

When I was around 10 years old my sibling moved away to live at a few different homes. This was the first time that my family had time to breathe and most of us broke down when we actually were able to look at ourselves and ask how we were doing (my brother has mild autism and ADD and mother has bipolar). When I was 10 years old i started regularly seeing a therapist, both on my own and as a family. I became depressed and got on antidepressants + was talking to a doctor about maybe having bipolar as well. They put me on a mild dose of lamictal that was actually helping a bit with my depression (I have bp2 so my BP is mostly depression and hypomanic episodes weren't that noticeable to me at that point).

Our family was a mess and my sibling still lived in homes pretty close by. I remember how they once walked back home in late autumn and the post car picked them up in the morning since they were walking around in a fucking t-shirt. Early morning we were woken up by them knocking on our door saying they wanted to come back home. After a while they moved to a home where teens with mental disabilities could go to get treatment while being able to go to school as well.

When I was around 11 my sibling called home one evening saying they were going to end themselves. They were talking about how I would get their laptop and my brother would get their cat like it wasn't that big of a deal. They lived about 3 hours away by car at this point and there was nothing we could do. We tried to contact police around there to help us but they were out and talking about doing it with railways so it wasn't easy to find them. The police did eventually find them and brought them back to the home and we went to visit a couple of days later. They were walking around laughing with one of their close friends as if nothing had happened a few days before (I will never forget that day when our whole family were crying around the kitchen table feeling hopeless for hours and not knowing if we'd already lost them). When some of my friends in school the day after asked why I didn't come to the thing we'd planned the day before I honestly didn't know what to say because none of them would ever be able to imagine what I'd been through or hopefully have to experience anything like it.

A lot of years from then until now where they aren't taking their meds, sleeping properly or realising that they need A LOT of help. When you talk to them it's either a mental breakdown where they run out screaming and crying (throwing a tantrum like a 5yo) or having a decent conversation where you feel like you're actually getting somewhere (only to be forgotten within s few days). They live with my Grampa and brother, siblings have the upstairs. I'm honestly happy Grampa has a hard time making it upstairs at this point because the place is a complete mess that would need professional cleaning to ever look like a living space. They occupy my room whenever I'm not here and it's full of a lot of things whenever I do go here (staying here in the summers to help Grampa with the big garden) and I honestly can't deal with it. When I got here this time they had to do the washing to get me some clean sheets. They were sleeping on the sofa in their room because they had no clean sheets while my brother was sleeping on the sofa downstairs since he had none. I had to fold the rest of the sheets when I got here because they were just in a pile on a chair downstairs and I realised my brother was crashing on the sofa downstairs when he was there before I woke up 2 days in a row. This was AFTER the sheets were cleaned. For him to actually change his sheets I had to put them on his bed and then come back later to make sure he started changing them.

My Grampa has stopped trying to make any changes in the dynamic because it just ends up with mental breakdowns, so he as a 80+ yo with issues with arms and shoulders are doing a lot of chores on his own. The sink upstairs is almost completely clogged and the shower is so unused that there are bugs crawling in it. We have for a long time tried to get the government to help BOTH of my siblings but whenever any help is offered they decline. I feel like I get forgotten a lot especially with my sibling since I function semi normal most of the time. I take my meds and most of the time sleep properly (hypomanis episodes fuck with my sleep) and most of the time function properly. But it's like they both forget that I'm also ill and have bat shit crazy depressions where I barely get out of bed. 

The thing that is upsetting me the most at the moment is when my sibling talks about how ""we'll"" make sure to do things. I actually want to slap them (sorry about being graphic) because they actually have the audacity to include themselves in helping our grandfather when I'm here. I agree that they sometimes do something but my god you are not taking care of him. If someone is visiting and they try to take the credit of ""yeah, you know we help Grampa out with the garden and chores"" I honestly want to laugh out loud. I've tried talking to them about it and saying they shouldn't be talking like that when they aren't doing that much. But in their mind they are. Maybe they might be doing something when I'm not here, but they sure as hell aren't when I am.

This post is long af and I don't know if anyone will ever read it, but I really needed to rant about this. I feel like every outburst and mental breakdown they are having is slowly tearing away prices of me and I'm trying to meditate and let go of the negative emotions about it all since I don't want Grampas last years to see the garden he's been working on his whole life wither away before his eyes. I'm trying my best to keep it together and we'll see how long I'll be able to stay here, we're a week into it at this point and it's been shipping away at me.

After a long day of working outside they want to hang out and play things or watch stuff while I'm really tired, but turning them away means hurting them emotionally which leads to a tantrum of screaming and crying. My mother has broken contact mostly since they get things like them abandoning them when they were a kid and not enough as a mother thrown in their face every other time they talk and my father is doing his best to be of support. He is hanging out a few times a week in the evening and trying to spend some time with them since they feel alone. Text or call every morning and evening to tell them to take their meds (which mostly still don't) and answers almost any hour of the day when they call him. I've realised recently that he does a lot more than I thought he was since I live a while away from here and don't see them too much. But my dad is working a full time job and lives with his fiancé while trying to take care of 2 people over 20 years old that had no concept of personal hygiene or cleaning at all (I don't enter my brother's room in fear of things moving on their own).

I don't think I'll be having much contact with either of my siblings (brother rarely returns calls or texts anyways) after Grampa dies. Right now I want a relationship with him and it's basically impossible to cut then out of my life since they live with him. My sibling has got it into their mind that they need us to help them through their trauma, which I can understand to a degree, but I'm not up for that shit. They made my life a living hell as a kid and I barely have any good memories with my family because they always needed all of the attention. A lot of it is a fog because I have mentally blocked a lot of it out. The fact that they feel entitled to me helping them in any way is one of the most selfish things they have ever done to me and it's hard to deal with that fact.

I'm dreading and looking forward to the day Grampa moves on and joins grandma in a better place since that will be the end of a lot of suffering for me. But until then I'm ready to try and put up with all of this, for him, my only living grandparent I have left.

I feel a big better after this rant and feel like I can keep going for a few more weeks here (hopefully)",1,0

It's on a professional social media n this head hunter spotted me (i'm decent at ""attention who\*ring"" toward a limited number of specialists like scholars etc)

Anyway she spotted me n said she could find me a job in my field despite my issues. She says she has a shrink / coach that do psychometric tests. I had the later on visio this morning. She suggested i might benefit from short sessions of trauma reduction (harassment ; loneliness ; brun-out ; numerous biographical breaks ; social-class migrant ... ).

With this, I might openly be hired as part of a positive discrimination scheme (tax reduction for businesses) for special people.

420,144zxh7,Seeking advice/wisdom on how to get through this very hectic period of my life (first post),"M | 28 | Bipolar II w/ heavy anxiety & depression, substance use issues, and (probably) ADHD & mild ASD


Hi y’all,

I’m coming to this community for support because for the last 4 weeks I feel like I’m losing control of my life and that I’m very close to falling apart completely.

About 4 weeks ago my grandfather had a very close brush with death and, since I’m very close to him, I semi-manically decided to pull the trigger on moving back home (a cross-country move). This had been something I’d had in the back of my mind lately, but due to recent events and my lease ending very shortly, I quickly committed. Although I have had little periods where I’m calm and level headed to sit down and actually plan this move, I feel like most days/moments I’m totally overwhelmed with the fear that somehow I’m definitely going to fuck this up. Whether that’s running out of money, having something come up during my drive I can’t handle, or messing up something with my family once I get there. 

And all of this mental/emotional turmoil & stress is negatively manifesting in my body (sore muscles, existing underlying pains are magnified, my immune system is shit) and in my behavior/actions (I’ve been really unable to focus at work/home, I’ve called out/left work a couple times, making up a medical issue to cover up my mental instability, and having conversations with family that tbh I’d even be a little worried about if I were them).

To add to all of this I have been getting high (weed) all day every day (which tbh isn’t very new at all, but lately I feel like it’s been fucking with my grasp on reality, along with other long term cognitive stuff). Also my caffeine intake has been crazy high (200-400 avg., can be up 600-700, daily) which I hate because it makes me so damn anxious & tense. But I can’t really stop/restrict myself because I believe it’s helping me (and tbh it really is the only thing powering me, especially since it’s not uncommon for me to eat just once a day before I go to bed). And in full disclosure my spending has been a little reckless, I just had a mini ritalin bender (that WAS for my moving drive…), I’ve drank alcohol twice in the last week (which I never really do), and my time spent on porn is becoming unhealthy. 

Moreover, I will be saying goodbye to a state that has been my home for 11 years and is where I became an adult. There are many feelings of regret, sadness, loss, joy, relief, and failure that I can feel that I’m not fully processing at this time. Pushing them down just below the surface.

I know in my logical mind that I’ve just really fucked up my brain chemistry this past 1.5 weeks, and that I wasn’t starting off in too good of a spot, and that I just have to ride this wave out. And I know that I’m like 85-90% sure I’m ready/prepared for this move (and that I have some support system if things go wrong). And I know, in my heart, that this really is the best move for me right now. 

But y’all, I really do feel like I’m losing it and that I’m on a slippery slope into breaking/going into psychosis - and I just can’t break out of the intrusive thoughts that keep me from getting excited & motivated for this move and the planning it takes. 

Anyways, thank you all for reading all of this, and please if you have any wisdom or words of encouragement to share, please do. 

Thanks again.",5,0
421,144uing,Telling people you're bipolar,"Hi there! I see pretty often on this subreddit posts about not telling people you are bipolar. I find this very interesting as I am pretty open about it to relatively anyone I converse with on a regular basis. To me it is simply something that comes up in conversation as almost everything relevant to my life has been traced back to it. After lurking on this subreddit for quite a bit a time I am beginning to doubt whether this is truly the best thing for myself.

&#x200B;

A few things to consider in my mind are that I don't communicate this to superiors at jobs or in general, it is only to my peers; furthermore, I am pretty young and wonder if this in large part a generational difference given people my age grew up in an environment even slightly more accepting of mental illnesses than even 10 years ago. I also do test the waters of people's opinions of people with mental illnesses before I reveal anything to others.  


I am just curious as to what other people's pros and cons are regarding this, I can't guarantee anything said changes my opinions or actions, but I do wonder if I am just weird and off putting or if this is totally sane behavior.

I didn't have time to even think, spend time with myself or with my family/friends. It's exciting to know I'm going to have so much spare time to do the things I wasn't able to do, but it's scary. I spent the whole summer only staying in bed and watching videos when I was 13. I'm scared I'm going to do the same, which just sends me into depression. Having too much time alone also sometimes triggers my hypomania. I literally ""attack"" everything around me while trying to kill some time.

I am extremely successful in my job and at age 23 i was the youngest chief in the country in my title, responsible for 60 people and responsible for a department with net income of 50 million per year. Then at age 24 i got a promotion and now I am responsible for around 50 people but a department that earns 130 million per year. Just to put in perspective.

6 months ago I bought a house with my bf. Dream house. We got a dog. Dream dog. We have it all together. He has a good job and income aswell. Dream income.

But i am not ok. 

A couple of years ago all of this would have been my biggest dream to achieve. But i am just feeling so MEH about everything. And i can't describe this feeling because it's the first time that it is this exact feeling that I am feeling. I just had a depression, a severe depression, and it just continued and evolved into this feeling of nothingness. 

My bff got engaged and I had to PRETEND to be excited for her. PRETEND. The real me is excited and I know my heart isn't this cold. I love her to death and I've always wanted this for her because it has been her biggest dream. But the fact that I had to fake and pretend happiness for her??? I just reacted how she would expect me to react and told her what I normally would say when I'm excited. But i felt .. hollow inside 

But since I can't describe it, since I 'on paper' am living the life and have accomplished so many things at such a young age, the psychiatrist really has a way of saying: ""well you're functioning"" 

When in reality i am not.

i am thinking that I can't stand another day of feeling.. unsatisfied and unhappy isn't even the words to describe it with ..but rather feeling NOTHING

I'd honestly rather have a depression og manic episode than feeling this numb

TRIGGER WARNING: Workplace SA



I work at my old high school. I live the people I work with so much. But this year, we got some new teachers. And one of them got super inappropriate with me. He did it slowly. He made it seem like we were just buddies at first. And then he told me that I had put off a vibe to him that I was into him, and he wanted to tell me before I put it on the table that he was “down”. I have always had major issues saying no to people. I told him I was uncomfortable in the nicest ways I could think of. Things just kept getting worse. 
One day, he got me to come to his classroom under the guise that he needed to speak to me. I made him promise we would ONLY be speaking and nothing else. His door was locked when I got there. And still locked when he let me in. I wasn’t thinking that you could still open the door from the inside. I was intimidated and nervous. The moment the door shut, he grabbed my chest with both hands and looked me dead in the face the whole time. I retracted and reminded him that’s not why I was there. We did speak about what I came there to speak about. And then as I got up to leave, he walked to the side of his desk, tapped it a few times and said, “I could fuck you right here, or you can blow me before you leave.” 

I have been in the process of recovering from an attempt on my life that caused me to have to move from Missouri all the way back to Arizona. It’s been along road full of intense highs and very low lows… but I was finally starting to stabilize. And then this happened. 

I was afraid. I wasn’t thinking straight. All I could think of was “I cannot let this man inside of me.” So I chose to do what I felt would be the “least damaging” option. 

I tried to hide it for months. I tried to ignore him as much as possible after that. But when I wouldn’t respond to messages, he would just find me in person. The things he would say to me were outrageously explicit. I told him uncountable times I was uncomfortable. I ended up reporting him on the last day of school about two weeks ago. 

I’ve spent the first two weeks of my summer in bed. I have slept through most of my days and most of the night. I can barely function even on my adderall XR and Zoloft. (I know zoloft isn’t right for everyone who is bipolar, but for me it’s been the only thing I’ve taken that works and I’ve been on a plethora of antipsychotics and they don’t work for me.) 

Today I took a half of a Klonopin and it helped me immensely. But I can’t rely on it every day. HR will be contacting him soon for an interview. I’m afraid. I’m stressed. I’m anxious. I feel guilty for saying anything. I feel guilty for his wife and his kids…. 

How do I keep going? How do I make myself get out of bed and function again? It’s never been this bad before. I don’t want to get back to the place I was just two years ago when I’ve come so far…",2,0

Lasso the bells off the cattle

Shallow it is to fill before dining 

No confusion amongst the jury 

My personal verdict reading: “No tethering to the post tightly in the cement block”

Her never moving amongst the frailer sails 

Sweet is privilege 

Where narcissists have rail.



When the husband doesn’t know the bell—

She scurries amongst murk to bottom feed on a stranger

Her analysis and thought: “22 looked to be pulled along like a carp to angler”.




I…

Starved… spastic, frantic idiot—set to be carved by a mid-aged charlatan

So hurried; transplanted so far off—impulsivity a spasm

Caught off; asphyxiated by confusion of new culture and language 

Blemished with delusions and suicidality

Wailing vulnerably—in the open with a mind of neon pulsating “pounce me”.



Cycling, habit—egos gonna suck me

Deplete to serve—a skeleton not my own

Depravity amongst gravity makes a blackhole 

Torn, splintered; older me knowing what human interaction means 

Being spat upon and beautified with ornaments on me

A brick amongst the others

Her eye attracted to the younger ones desperate and in the need for help

Not respected—a jester who swelters amongst his thoughts 

“Where has all my marrow gone?”

When so bare they decorate you up

These ornaments all over; illusive are the heavier ones

Bringing all my locomotion to a halt

No clamor from the audience 

Fate is engrained in my thoughts 

Never polite to be fretful in face when others are to be waited upon.",1,0
460,144kdyf,After my first big manic episode I just got a BP diagnosis,"Hi everyone, I just got a diagnosis which I did not expect at all and I just don’t know how to feel. I have had multiple depressive episodes with the biggest one happening last September. We ( my psychiatrist, my psychologist and myself ) thought it was a burn out which culminated on an out of nowhere SA. I also have ADHD and was treated both for depression and ADHD. 
This past weekend I have not slept for 42h straight and I felt amazing. The best I ever felt, super energised, talked for hours without stopping, had amazing sex with my husband while the week before I was super depressed. Today I had my usual psychiatrist appointment and after talking to him about all that, he asked me so questions to evaluate me and told me I just had a manic episode. And that I should stop taking my anti depressants right away. 
It’s kind of hard knowing what to think. It felt amazing. I don’t know why people would take meds to not feel like this. 
And this diagnosis has so much stigma especially in my community.

462,144nevg,Disclosing to Employers,"I've seen a lot of posts about when to tell employers or acquaintances about your diagnosis and most seem to say you just shouldn't do it.  I know I'm lucky with where I work now in that they take employee mental health VERY seriously (I work with vulnerable adults which can be very taxing for everyone), but even when I worked as a housekeeper for a hotel I had it down under disabilities.  Here's my reasoning:

I don't want my employer to be caught off guard when I start acting oddly and I think it helps having more people around who can help clock symptoms.  I do know a lot of times people can be very disrespectful about this though.

The biggest reason is reasonable accommodation as per the Americans with Disabilities Act (something I know a lot about thanks to my job).  When I'm manic there is a very specific way I know I can keep productive and if that isn't possible then I need to change schedule or take time off.  Time off of course only needs a note and doesn't need to be specific.  As a housekeeper having disclosed my diagnosis meant when I told them I was having an episode and needed to have my accommodations and they said ""we'll see"" I was able to say ""no, either I have the accommodations as specified or I'm going home and you can't retaliate or I swear to god I'll sue you"" (I was bluffing on that part, I don't have the money to sue, lol).

Now, I been taking 1-2 classes at time. I did try three classes at once for a semester, but I got overwhelmed by the workload. It made feel depressed too. I felt like I didn't have enough time to unwind or relax. Somehow, I finished strong.

He would tell me that I'm not getting it, that I was acting slow, forgetting things, not taking initiative, ect. I tried getting on disability before I applied to this job because before I stopped working, my episodes would prevent me from working when I was working and could never hold a job.

He decided to fire me because he believes that the meds I was on were preventing me from doing my job right. That I was always spacing out, had fog brain. (I'm on abilify and wellbutrin)

At pride I met this guy and after like an hour of talking to him I went over to his house and did drugs with him and got insanely wasted and pressured into sex. I never would have done anything like that normally. But this is a pattern I've noticed that happens sort of frequently when I'm meeting new people.

I change the locations of the pillows and blankets on the couch. This sounds stupid but it allows variety and so I can feel a ""different"" comfy each day.

I got a couple of candles. I light a different one each time depending on my mood. Citrus for energy, lavender for relaxing.

487,143ue8e,Lost another job.,"First time poster. 56 yo male. Only a handful of family members know I was diagnosed 15 years ago. Mom and brother seem to dismiss it. They think just because my dad had a temper that I have a temper, and not bipolar. Although, I check pretty much every box on the ""Are you bipolar"" questionnaire.

I was just let go from my 2nd job in 9 months. The first was for asking a gal who was verbally harassing me to ""please shut the fuck up"". I was very polite about it. They fired me for 'aggressive behavior'. The fired her 3 months later as she was a trouble maker and lied, alot.

This time was for differences with the big boss. He was a micro-manager and liked to talk behind my back to the line workers and office staff. He never came to me about issues, only them. He is a half owner in the business, so what he wants, he gets. This is the first time I've ever told an employer about my bipolar, but they didn't seem to think much about it. They said he and I can't see eye to eye, and he owns half the business, so....

I can't count the number of jobs I've lost or walked away from over the years. I'm now at an age and point in my life that I wonder if I'll ever own a home again. Will I ever retire. Can I hold a job for more than a couple years?

I don't really want to talk to anyone locally, because I don't want to end up in a data base, with very little help in exchange for it. I was diagnosed years ago by a doctor, and everyone just keeps filling the Seroquel script every month since. No need to confess my life to someone to confirm anything.

I've lived the good life, and I've lived the simple life. I'm good either way. I've strived to achieve and live the good life for the past 22 years.

488,143r1hk,It's my birthday.,"It's my birthday and I'm spending it without friends or doing any big celebration or anything. I've had some really great birthdays in the past. I usually go on trips, have really sweet celebrations with my husband, and a long time ago, got together with a lot of friends. 

I don't really have any friends anymore to see on birthdays. (This is of my own doing and I understand that and am perfectly okay with that for the most part) I'm also without my husband because he's still stuck in a work contract. I've been having a few depressive episodes maybe its because my husband's gone or that I don't really have any friends to hang out with, but I'm going to be completely honest with myself and say that I know it isn't really any of those things. I have depressive episodes for just about anything. I had a full on meltdown and was having a few thoughts of suicidal ideation when a moth got into the house a few days ago. It sucks to be like that. To have episodes for any reason. Moths don't seem that big of a deal to anyone else. Definitely not enough to end your life over. 

Family have been surprised I don't want to atleast go out to out and things but honestly I just want to go to the bookstore get a few horror books, stay home the rest of the day, play my favorite video game (The sims) watch old cartoons, maybe play my favorite online game and just relax.

Because, I've been stressing myself out so much lately. I have bipolar disorder and Autism, so I have a lot of social issues and its really, really HARD to be around people, or anyone. Even close family members. 

I'm always trying to remember if I'm saying the right things, wearing the right expressions, or doing something wrong, or being weird, or constantly thinking if others hate me even though I have no real reason for this thought, or overthinking simple social interactions to the point it stresses me to tears. It exhausts me doing this all day every day. So, yes. I want to stay home and be alone. I just want one day. One day without these constant thoughts of anxiety, depression, struggling to fit in and mask correctly, and maybe that sounds sad, but I prefer not to dwell on that, and just be happy my mind can maybe be a bit quiet this one day. That's all I want for my birthday at this point.",24,0

What I really need is a change in my medication. However, my psychiatrist keeps cancelling my appointments. It’s now been over 5 months since I last saw him. My community mental health team have been communicating with him about the state of my mental health, but all I’ve heard from him is radio silence. I’m essentially left to fend for myself. 

I’ve been to the hospital after trying to take my own life on the 19th of May. Or maybe it was the 18th. I can’t really remember but the hospital said I wasn’t a suicide risk and discharged me. My mother protested but they said, “We don’t control the mental health beds anyway.” 

After I went to the hospital, my community mental health team referred me to the home treatment team. They discharged me the same day they met me, citing that I, somehow, disengaged from them. 

I went back to my community mental health team, their advice was to ring the out of hours GP and start the process to be hospitalised. Apparently, it takes a GP and a social worker. My mother rings the out-of-hours GP and he asks me if I feel unwell. Because I answered “yes,” I was told I have insight and that there was nothing he could do. Oh, and to also go back to the same hospital who discharged me. 

It’s now at the point where I am genuinely disengaging with my mental health team because I’m no longer well enough to make it to appointments.

Diagnosed with ""mixed bipolar"" per my psychiatrist. Anger is really almost too common of an emotion for me, so arguments happen really quickly - even if I'm not meaning for them to. Or even have a reason to be angry?

Anyway, I'm writing this because I'm curious. After a while in most arguments, I can't help but laugh. It's not like a ""I'm Laughing AT you!"" It's just .... I can't keep a straight face. I have no idea what comes over me but I can't keep my smile away. It's actually uncontrollable. And when I do surpress it, it looks (probably) even worse that I'm hiding laughter.

Almost everytime it happens, the other person gets so much angrier. I get it, it seems like I'm laughing at you. In reality, I have no idea why I started laughing. Sometimes it's just a grin, tonight I was staring the other person in the eyes and just . . . Let out a laugh. Short. But it was enough for them to become so much more irritated at me. 

""I can't stand it when you do that shit.""

Me neither!

I was thinking maybe it's just the sudden hit of ""I'm Done Arguing."" Because sometimes halfway through arguments, my mood will change and I'm over it - done. Ready to move on. Like it never happened.

Right is wrong and wrong is right, everything is both good and bad and it's all just a big fucking circle of possibilities and paradoxes. NOTHING IS REAL.

Time is moving both faster and slower. My senses are heightened but also dulled in some ways - even my voice doesn't feel like my own, my vision is distorted, and my physical body is hungry right now but nothing tastes good or is appealing, physically tired but fully charged. Doing everything on autopilot and the thoughts are coming in so fast in abstract yet completely logical ways. Writing it out helps but hurts but hurts at the same time bc I can't even grasp all the thoughts bc they're coming and going so quickly.

Words in themselves have no real meaning anymore even though they're useful in describing what's happening. But at the same time they're super important. Everything in my world is collapsing and folding in on itself and nothing matters and everything does.

521,143kdct,Bipolar Medical Leave,"First time posting in here. I typically read threads in this group but don’t post. Hoping to gain some insight.

Hi friends, I have a bit of a dilemma. My medical leave from work has run out, and my job is no longer willing to accommodate additional medical leave regardless of what my doctor recommends. Little back story: I suffer from Bipolar I, anxiety, and PTSD. I will admit I’ve been off work intermittently for  about a year, in that time I was hospitalized 5 times, and completed several PHPs and IOPs. Any time off work has truly been spent trying to better my mental health.

Originally, I was given 4 options to choose from when returning to work: 

return to banking (roughly 60 hrs per week in a high pressure sales environment)

Return to banking with reduced hours (40/wk) still a high pressure sales environment, but the kicker is I would still have to do the same amount of work as my teammates working 60+ hours per week

Separate from the company (terrified of not having health insurance as my treatment is rather intense)

Find a new role within the same company- I was told I was have 30 days to find a posted position through the internal system and interview for said position.

I ultimately decided to search for a new role within the company. I like the idea of keeping my benefits and still working for a reputable company, not to mention I specifically moved to this state 3 years ago to pursue my original banking career. I have a lot invested in this company, but I know the pressure and work load may not be ideal for my mental health recovery. The new position would likely pay a little less, not being a sales based role, but I can afford to take a bit of a pay cut.

Fast forward to yesterday (technically day 1/30 to find a new position) I get a call from HR, giving me 3 options that I have to choose from within 24 hours if I want to maintain employment with the company.

1. Relocate 3 hours away to a different office to make roughly HALF of the income I have making previously. Totally not what I expected, and out of question.
2. Return to banking with reduced hours (40/wk). Still a very high pressure sales environment, where I am expect to give roughly 80 clients my personal cell number and be available at all times. The pay structure is based on your production goal for the month. I would still have the same production goals as my teammates, but have less time to make sales. 
3. Separate from the company effective today.
Im very frustrated, overwhelmed, and paralyzed by making such a huge decision in 24 hours. I did express that it seems unfair to give me 30 days initially then make me make a decision overnight.

I know looking for jobs outside of the company would be ideal, but I didn’t go to college so I’m just worried I’m not qualified to do much or make much in terms of pay. I’m not opposed to making less, but I got comfortable with the income I’ve been making for the last 3 years, and now have financial responsibilities I didn’t have previously (like a mortgage payment).

I just bought my house 2 years ago, it’s beautiful and I love it and the payment is very reasonable compared to rent in the area. 

I’m worried whatever decision I make will cost me my home. Moving to this state for the job and buying a house are probably my two biggest accomplishments in life.

I just have layers and layers of worry, making it impossible to make a decision.",4,0
522,143bg4y,I don't know how to do it anymore.,"The last month and a half has just been an absolute shit show and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.

This is long but I am hoping someone out there will read it. 

I moved in with my partner into an amazing apartment and in less than a month we were informed they're selling the building - after an extremely thorough application process where we stressed we were looking for someplace to live for at least the next three years. Now we have no guarantees of that. And I've had to work at home for all the viewings (we're still not fully unpacked and I hate it) so my cats don't get super stressed out but it's still affecting them majorly anyway. 

My job that I just started in February has progressively gotten harder and harder. I was given accounts that others did not want to deal with and now a plethora of procedure changes have made my accounts as difficult as the team member who has been there for 20+ years while the other newer member of the team just tried to pass on the harder work to me.

I had what I thought was a hit and run incident where a woman scuffed the fk out of my car coming out of her driveway because she didn't see me. It turned into a whole confrontation at the police station but now I just don't want to deal with insurance or court dates so I'm just going to drop it. I think I can buff things out at home anyway and it's not worth the insurance increase. 

I got super upset with my obgyn office because they wouldn't refill my birth control one last time. I currently have four days left. I made an appointment with a doctor in the same medical group thinking it would be okay but it wasn't. I had to schedule an appointment at the doctor's office that's now 20+ miles away. I lost my cool on the phone and even though I apologized, I don't think they're going to refill my prescription now. 

My meds feel like they don't do anything anymore. I've been using cerebral for over a year and just cancelled my subscription because I was (miraculously) able to get a psych appointment two weeks from now at a new doctor - but I'm so scared of how it will go and of their diagnosis will align with my previous one.

I haven't been on a vacation in four years and now I may not be able to go on the small one we were trying to take at the beginning of July because someone else on my team was going to take off as well.

And those are just the big items. I can't stand it anymore. I've broken down into crying panic attacks most mornings in the last two weeks and I have no idea how to keep going. I'm worried about affording my new psych doctor, I don't think I can afford therapy, I can't afford all the other doctor and dentist visits I know I need. What's the fucking point anymore?",11,0

528,143k91f,Struggling," I was diagnosed with bipolar II in 2020 after a hospital stay. My bipolar has mostly been depression with a very rare and short episode of mania every once in a while. It has been well controlled with meds until recently. I have been having pretty bad mood swings that include longer bouts of mania, which is new to me. I’m talking daily mood swings and insane manic episodes. Nothing extreme but it is uncomfortable because I have racing thoughts and I’m impulsive with spending and I want to talk to everyone about anything that pops into my head but I’m very lonely. I also have no outlets except the gym and I’m trying to take care of a three year old with very little time for myself. I spoke with my psychiatrist last week about changing some dosages on my current medication because I am very hesitant to change medications completely after a very bad experience with a psych many years ago (I had a bad reaction to lamictal, I thought my parents were trying to kill me and they also pulled me off of a medication I had been on for a very long time without titration sending me into withdrawals while also dealing with the side effects from the lamictal) and my main medication helps me sleep. The same hospital stay in was diagnosed bipolar was because I suddenly stopped sleeping and was awake for almost three days and I was having very serious thoughts of self harm, so medication changes scare me because I want to be able to sleep.

I began seeing a therapist about three months ago but she practices “rogerian” therapy which is basically talking to her as though she is just a friend, not a medical professional. She did kind of help with a few things but I stopped seeing her recently because I felt I wasn’t getting any  coping mechanisms from her.

So now I feel stuck. I’m having daily manic episodes and I don’t know how to deal. I have anxiety and these episodes are so much different from that so my usual tricks aren’t working. My executive disfunction is shot. I feel sick and exhausted from these wild swings. I’m not myself. Obviously I need to find a new therapist but I can’t find it in me to sit down and do this. I can’t find the time or motivation. I’m trying desperately to find balance and relax and by the time I feel slightly stable I need to take care of something like laundry or cleaning or picking up my son from school and I can’t concentrate when he’s here.

The past two weeks I wake up super tired at each awakening. Sometimes I can fall back asleep in a short while, other times I'm up for a hour or few.

I also wake up feeling extra tired when I wake up officially to get out of bed.

I think it could be caused by my depression. I have lost interest in many things, including my hobbies. My theory is I'm not sleeping well because my mind isn't as active like it was during the spring semester.

Trazodone isn't working for me. Which sucks because it has been my go-to sleep med for two years now.

On the bright side, I see my psychiatrist next week about it.

I don’t know if this is making sense to anyone else but it’s getting really tiring to feel so ashamed of myself for every little thought. Like, in my head every person on Earth is automatically more inherently worthy and smarter than me (but also I’m actually pretty intelligent, hardworking and not a terrible person…?) and it’s been really getting to me lately.

542,143misd,My Personal Theory on Bipolar,"Since my first and hopefully only manic episode, I have reflected substantially on what really sparks these types of episodes. This isn't so much a universal theory of Bipolar but this is kind of how I see it working on my end.

So I believe we are presented with themes that we are preoccupied with. True unresolved feelings and emotions.
For me, I was filled with concern over health (I have chronic illness), family issues, and having some sort of legacy.

As a result I imagined that my problems were solved. That a fictitious philanthropic family wanted to take me in and solve said problems. Every beautiful girl wanting my hand in marriage. Everyone was celebrating me as I in contrast, felt worthless.

So for me, it seems like there are certain themes and triggers that contribute to stress and when you focus on the stressful situations that don't resolve it can lead to emotional damage.

I think it varies with everyone as our brains are wired in all sorts of different ways but this was just something I thought up.

My son crying for him isn't helping. I have financial stability and am working full-time and am going back to school to further education but there's a lot of things unresolved in my past relationship occasionally spilling over the surface. 

I've suggested family therapy but he's stated he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't think he wants to (we had been together for 6 years). I can hear the sadness in his voice one second and then the next no emotion. He's been understanding in the aspect of  supporting me with living accommodations and putting himself second, but he's only been moved out/away for 2 months. 

He says he hates me? But then today was willing to have a conversation about life. I don't freaking know. 

 But I know our awful communication will affect our son long-term & my state of well-being and I'm just trying to back on track to give my son a healthy life.  

Unsure how to cope with guilt/grief to this degree with this diagnosis and could use advice because therapy's a little expensive to be asking at this point. 

I've apologized to people I hurt for the entirety of the year & have made ammends with whom I can and have tried to get things back on track. I acknowledge I'm responsible for decisions I made or did not, I just wish I could explain that wasn't my normal self.

I felt the decline before it happened and I communicated to loved-ones but I received a lot of them brushing it off as I had been ""stable"" for a long time. But COVID isolation & giving birth triggered a lot. 

But I'm starting to randomly have bad anxiety attacks and I think it's over unresolved issues with my previous partner. I'm starting to realize maybe I've been in shock. 

It's like I'm just now grieving the entire ordeal and I've been suppressing it? 

I feel like I want to isolate from everyone in my life for various reasons and I know that's not healthy. 

I think I'm starting to decline again but unsure how to prevent it. I just want stability accross the board.",16,0

My boredom feels extreme. Sometimes painful even.

Everyday I wake up in hopes today will be different. That I will feel better. I get disappointed everytime. But I can only hope.

Perhaps I need a medication change or adjustment? I see my psychiatrist next week about it. But until then I don't know what to do to make the week more bearable.

For the past 6 years or so, I’ve noticed a pattern which I’ve been calling “dissociation episodes”. Sometimes there’s an obvious trigger, and sometimes not at all. When these happen, it’s like I’m panicking and filled with doom and worry, but I also don’t feel like myself at all, it feels like I’m dead inside, I can’t work, I have trouble understanding anything. How I feel better is by taking some seroquel and sleeping. When I wake up I’m back to normal. 

Basically though it has come to my attention that these episodes happen bc of stress— it’s like a flee or dissociative response to stress instead of fight or flight.

But frankly for three years that's not a lot.

I was talking with a friend the other day who has been much more succesful at managing her mental illness. I asked her if she was me, what she would do differently. She said that I needed to change my mindset. I needed to stop assuming that I'd fail because it means I never try.  I believe her. I agree with her. I don't know how.

At the time I thought I had another job lined up but for one reason or another they went in a different direction. I started drinking even more heavily than usual and was drunk every night for about a week and a half. That ended with me saying some horrible things to my wife and mother, and some extreme psychotic depression. I haven't had a drink since and plan on never drinking again.

565,142tga5,I was 13 years old when I learned recurring suicidal ideation is not normal.,"I was in a class and one day, we were discussing health and self-esteem, etc for kids our age. We did an exercise where our teachers gave us a worksheet with multiple choice answers . Once we had submitted them, my teacher was going through the responses and stopped the class and said, we should all be kind because someone here has thought of suicide more than once. Everyone looked around cautiously while she talked and I remember looking down while she talked and when I looked up I realized everyone else was looking around trying to see who it might be. I quickly pretended to do the same. I don’t think anyone caught on.

I’d been the “smart” kid since I before I could remember and held small leadership roles for my grade. I don’t think anyone ever suspected it was me.

Before that day in class, I’d always had ambiguous thoughts of disappearing or just wishing I didn’t live.

I was not diagnosed with bipolar until I was 34.

When did others realize that most people don’t wish they weren’t alive for (more or less) every day of their life?

So yes, at first I was just angry given how she also kept telling me Lithium can't make you sluggish while it very much can since it's written literally everywhere and it did when she had given me a higher dose but now that it's lower and with prolonged release instead of popping 2 pills I voiced some concerns and she just ignored them

I'm not scared but I'm starting to think maybe I'm just imagining not being able to sleep and feeling elated, just like I did when I had suspicions of being bipolar before getting diagnosed. I don't spend a lot, sure I'm on a limited budget being a full time student living with my parents so who knows what I'd do with unsupervised access to larger quantities of money, but I mean how far does the ""everyone has it different"" thing go?

I was diagnosed by a therapist years ago as bipolar 2 but didn't put any stock into it due to some complications I had with that therapist. I hit a really low point in my life last summer and decided to find a psychiatrist and get some help. 

This new doctor had my try lots of anti depressant medications which all ended up making me extremely agitated and short with people. My new doctor believes I am bipolar 1 and was going through mania for about 3-4 months. (attempted to change everything about my life, changed jobs, fasted for hours daily to cut weight and running 5 miles every day, was running at 100mph and was just awful to people) 

As of today I am lithium carbonate and have been on it for about 3 months. I feel really well balanced and even have heard from family how different I seem. 

My problem is I can't sleep, I fall asleep and get about an hour but wake up every single night with leg tics and fight to go back to sleep.

Ive expressed this to my doctor and was prescribed Ativan for sleep. I don't want to take this drug because I know how habit forming it is but last night I cave and took one. It relaxed me but I still just could not get to sleep. I spoke with my doctor today and she suggested putting me back on nortriptyline which was a drug I was taking when she says I was experiencing mania, I don't know why this was suggested.. 

As a child I was diagnosed with tourrette syndrome and struggled immensely. When I was in my 20s my tics subsided for the most part but my mood swings were all over the place. I've tried many SSRIs and tricyclic medicines but I've never felt as balanced as I do on the lithium.

572,142wled,"Folks with bipolar, did you have to adjust to your medicated self?/How did your lifestyle change once you got on medication?","I am 21F, diagnosed bipolar I a year ago, but I have had symptoms since late childhood/early teens. Before adulthood I experienced typical and awful bouts of depression, where I got barely anything done and was able to do well in school just by being a smart slacker, interspersed with periods of (hypo)mania where I would sleep much less, feel euphoric and productive, and get a fuck ton done... even as a teen I'd feel so inspired/creative and in my own head that I'd write heaps, some of which became national prize-winning stuff, or published work. So I kind of fell into this cycle of doing absolutely nothing when depressed and then just waiting for the mania/hypomania to kick in so that I could rapidly catch up on everything and be my ""normal"" self, frontloading work and accomplishments before the depression inevitably hit again.

Now, as an adult, this has made me incredibly unhealthy. Before ""doing nothing when depressed"" just meant playing videogames and crying in my room and just coming out for dinner; now it means substance abuse (weed and cigarettes), dirty laundry piling up everywhere, plates that need to be cleaned, bills that I am late on...

I don't even ""catch up on life"" when manic anymore, my thoughts move too fast and the euphoria is too intense for me to get much done, and all bets are off obviously if I become psychotic/manic manic. I also have ADHD that is also way more destructive in adulthood than it was when I was younger, and it's difficult to focus hypo/manic energy into productivity much of the time. Now I just spend a lot, go on a lot of walks/runs (lol), and make embarrassing posts on social media...

I feel like I spend all of the time inside my head, either trying to numb the pain or just trying to ride the waves. I've been on medication for 6 months and it has helped. My moods are much more even and I feel way more ""normal"". I am glad to not be psychotic or suicidal. But everything feels less exciting, for one... not in a good or bad way, just objectively. Life is more predictable now. More stable, and that's good. But less exciting.

And also, the fact that I have built my entire personality and living habits around having these extreme and unpredictable shifts in mood. I am glad that I can let go of those habits now, but I'm not quite sure that I know how. I've never had a ""healthy""/stable approach to life, and have very few healthy habits and don't know how to start building them. I don't know how to start working on things at a steady, even and predictable pace, I don't know how to gently manage my life in a sustainable way, that's never been me. I feel still like I'm waiting for something to happen, for me to get super depressed, or better, super high and manic so that I can ""start"" doing stuff. Has anyone else experienced this?

I'm talking unable to go to work and having to request time off, unable to leave bed for majority of the day, little to no appetite, shutting people out (isolating), and overall unable to take care of yourself anymore. 

It's been hard to get myself to shower, do my skincare routine, brush my teeth, and make myself food to eat. My birthday is coming up and I am going on a trip with my family this week. I have zero excitement and it's hard to look forward to things. The past years that I've been THIS low, I've had to check myself into the hospital because of hopelessness and suicidal ideation. I've spent 3 birthdays in the psych ward and this year I can't check myself in because I have this trip coming up and I still have hope that I can push through this. 

I don't know why this happens around the same time every single year. If you also experience this please let me know how you try to bring yourself out of your depressive episode. My meds are good right now, I might need an increase though, not sure. I'm currently on Viibryd 20mg and Olanzapine 5mg and have Bipolar 2.",1,0

if i wake up myself that’s fine, i can wake up and get on with my day but omg if somebody ELSE wakes me up and they do it in a way that somehow overwhelms and angers my irrational brain i literally ball my eyes out, feel confused and lost in routine, can’t focus, and quite frankly it makes me feel slightly suicidal. it’s absolutely insane and embarrassing and i can’t stand it.

some ways of waking me up cause more extreme reactions than the others. waking me up in a blunt “get up it’s _:_am” will just make me angry but waking me up in a “i’m doing such and such and taking the car and you need to get up right now” kinda way is an example of what DESTROYS my mood and i can’t help it. it’s not just that, there are other ways, it’s just the matter of wanting to literally DIE because someone woke me up wrong. maybe it’s the being woken up to a plan that wasn’t discussed and i feel out of the loop? not being able to have a conversation about a plan is VERY hard for me, i absolutely hate it.

Hello everyone. I had to stop all of my meds cold-turkey the past few months as my doctor refuses to pick up his phone, and I ran out of money.

I am wondering how you guys deal with these episodes when they roll through.

I now live with a brand new person who i consider to be my closest friend right now. i may be transferring schools as i live near a different university in our city now.

needless to say this triggered a manic episode while moving that I'm now crashing from. I'm missing work. I'm vaping more than ever.

I'm between psychiatrists right now. my old psych retired a few months ago without telling me after discharging me a year prior. i only found out because my prescription got canceled. I'm now working with my family doctor to come up with a treatment plan. I hadn't been sleeping well, hence the seroquel prescription. 

my question is whether anyone notices a difference between brand name and generic with any of these medications, but specifically abilify as generic was given to me in place of brand name around the middle of the month when i picked up my prescriptions.

I'm also wondering whether the seroquel is the best choice. I've been having terrible side effects such as blurred vision, confusion, dizziness, and feeling faint.

599,142ogdt,Is there therapy for someone traumatized by dealing with their illness alone?,"I have seen many therapists and I feel it can help but always grinds to a halt when talking about trauma. My outside life has been pretty good. I have good relationships with my family, mostly stable romantic relationships throughout my life, barely any kind of bullying growing up, a great marriage, friendsn education, talents, financial security, most people seem to like me...

My life has been better than your average person it seems. My mood disorder started around puberty and I dealt with extreme mood changes and unstable emotions, sometimes to things that I knew were inconsequential or for no reason at all.

I've come to the conclusion that my mood disorder was almost solely neurological but my anxiety stuck around. I kept quiet about my problems growing up because of the shame I felt. Everything was fine in my life, so why do I feel this way? I don't deserve help for these behaviors because maybe I'm being overly dramatic, lazy, selfish, attention seeking (even though I hid the issues as best I could and was never honest about how I felt). I was a young teen, knowing my life was average to good and feeling so confused and guilty about what I was going through. 

The last therapist I was working with did internal family systems with me. For those who dont know, its a type of therapy that recognizes and works with different parts of the self and will even talk to those parts through guided meditation. It was great therapy and I learned a lot, but she was making me feel unheard when it came to dealing with my mood disorder. She felt it was a ""part"" of me that I could speak with. 

So I did. My parts always looked like me, but my mood disorder was this horrible amorphous black haze, almost blazing like fire and would just float around like an asshole. I let it speak and the face it has was indescrible and the sounds it made still haunt me. I had the worst panic attack I had in a long time seeing that.

It had nothing to offer. It was like personifying a disease or a cancer and believing I could somehow reason with it. She kept insisting it was possible and our relationship just fell apart from there. I cried and pleaded for her to believe me, that it was the trauma of dealing with a mood disorder by myself as a child and not because of some outside force that is easily recognized or quantifiable. 

Am I alone here? I feel like all my trauma came from within and the anxiety I still deal with comes from the bad habits I acquired while working through it by myself and all the guilt I felt for feeling like my emotions and feelings were totally invalid and that I made a decision to feel that way. 

I need help but every single therapist I talk to always seem to dig for some kind of horrific event, consistent abuse, anything that could explain why I'm still dealing with anxiety. 

For context, it took a while, but with some healthy decisions and trial and error, I found a medication combination that has me fairly stable for several years (with needed tweaks here and there). But I still have issues opening up to people close to me, being honest about my well being, having shit self esteem, and my biggest issue right now is dealing with an eating disorder for the last couple years. I'm 37.

I've taken CBT and DBT classes, but most of the time I just feel triggered when taking those classes. It reminds me of all the times I've employed those techniques just to have them fail because my brain just wasn't having it and feeling horrible for ""just not trying hard enough.""

606,142h1hw,I’m so bitter towards myself," woke up this morning after about a week of falling into a mini depression (compared to how it used to get without my medication.) Im out of pot and I finished my last cigarette yesterday morning. I told myself im done smoking anything because my brain just wants to do that all day when im depressed. I also binge eat and gain like 20 pounds when I smoke pot and am depressed. Once im over the low spells, I quickly try to loose the weight and do so successfully in about a month in a half. 

The pattern has been my life. Im 25 and have been doing this long before I knew I had bipolar, it started when I was like 17. I would go through Taco Bell and order like 8 things on the menu and just smoke out and eat it all in one sitting then go to the next place and do it there. I would then obsessively run to loose weight while literally taking cigarette breaks. This was before I was medicated so this was how I almost tuned out of the world with my bad habits 

I went about a year without doing this but recently I just randomly started doing all that I described again. I have been medicated and my brain has been feeling probably 40% better than it ever has. That difference makes the pain feel more like the normal and the more stable times feel more boring. 

I don’t know. I wanted to rant. I know all of this is better than having a drug or alcohol problem but it just hurts. What I am saying is that I woke up and realized that I think I do this still to this day because I’m bitter of all the time I’ve lost to this illness. Im bitter with how it feels like the youth I could have had was robbed from me by some unpredictable illness. I think I hold onto these coping mechanisms of self destruction because I subconsciously feel I have no choice but to be this way because I don’t deserve anything more.

She stuck with me through 2 psychosis episodes that landed me in the hospital. All while she was nurturing our little man. Just a shout out that I’m still in love with her. Taking in the good memories today.,61,0
619,1428xk8,I'm sick of my meds,"sorry this is going to be a short rant, so if you don't want to read it please keep scrolling. 

I started taking meds in February (I'm on 5mg abilify) and at first it was great but now I feel like I just can't feel anything at all. no happiness, just pain and numbness. 
I really try to do everything I can to make it better, I eat right, go to the gym, (don't sleep pretty well but there's nothing I can really do about that)
I just want to feel something again. I feel like I lost myself. I don't even know what I like anymore. I'm afraid to go off my meds but I also hate what they're doing to me.
does anyone else feel this way?",5,0

What is left of the hyper me that, made a movie and took sexy pictures.

I noticed that majority of people told me that ""i'm crazy"", ""i'm speaking nonsense"", ""i'm impossible to be around"", ""i'm annoying"" and  ""loud"".There's more but these are common i heard.

It can be sometimes violent and it can be sometimes something harmless.It depends.If you want to calm me down you either have to be patient with me or gentle.Sometimes that will not work.I can be very unpredictable with it.

627,1424q20,Depakote- managing weight,"Hi Everyone,

I am curious to know if anyone has had success managing their weight on depakote? 

After trying many meds over the years Depakote seems like my best option. I was on lithium for over three years and while it was amazing it caused me to break out in severe acne. 

I haven’t found a medication that made me feel like lithium did until I started taking depakote. I am so hungry all the time and I’m not sure what to do. As much as I felt the weight gain would be better than the acne, I’m not so sure anymore. It’s really bothering me how I can’t seem to stop eating. I’m honestly tired of being on medications at this point. 

Part of me just wants to stop taking them completely and see what happens. But I know all too well that it’s  probably not a good idea. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is if depakote worked well for you were you able find a way to manage your weight? Sugar cravings?

I’m also on seroquel and Zoloft, but depakote was added most recently.

I am grateful that I was able to recover, distance myself from the people i was hanging around back then, focus on my studies, and move on from those actions without any long-term consequences such as a child, an STD, or a permanent life-altering decision. I’ve graduated uni and I’m starting a good job in a very nice company. Nevertheless, I wish I did not have to carry the weight of those actions for the rest of my life.

So today I had an appointment for an ADHD evaluation. I was diagnosed with it as a child but we never got deeper into it. As I had to see a psychiatrist to renew my medication, I decided to do a full test to see what type of ADHD I have and bla bla bla. 

After the 3 hour meeting where I answered a lot of questions about my past, my current life... The psychiatrist told me that I was indeed ADHD, but the main problem was that I am bipolar type 2. My first reaction was to say ""well, I don’t think so"". My mother is bipolar and all my life I've tried not to be like her, so this diagnosis really turned me upside down. 

Since I don't have depressive episodes, I've tried to challenge her because for me it doesn't make sense to be bipolar if all I get are highs and moments of joy that are too intense (which I thought were due to ADHD) but she says that it can happen in some people. 

She doesn't want to renew my Concerta prescription, saying she's too afraid my bipolarity will cause a manic episode. So she wants me to take Lamotrigine for 3 months and then she'll put me back on Concerta.

I'm honestly still shocked by this diagnosis. Does this make sense to you? Should I get a second opinion?",4,0

To me it seems like people only see the surface, they just see the times when you weren't at your best because you were ill.

I’ve been on over 10 or 11 medications mostly antidepressants. Ever since Zoloft stopped working for me in 2018. I was trialed on Lamictal but it didn’t work and each time I’m put on an anti-depressant, I become agitated, restless, and I don’t really get much of a mood lift.
When I come off them, I feel better for a week or two before my mood goes down. My main issue is depression and anxiety. I may have manic like symptoms, but that seems to be antidepressants induced.

My psych now wants to put me on sodium valproate, and at this point I’m just resigned to going along with it because I’ve lost hope with a lot of other things.

Yet, in a movie theatre, I absolutely LOVE to watch movies!!  My local theatre has big comfy recliner seats, and it’s dark, and my sole attention is on the movie.  I also love popcorn.  My first job as a teenager was at a small local theatre.

I don’t have any other symptoms of ADHD.  If it’s my meds, what can I do about it?

I’m on disability and my teenager spends most of the time at their father’s house…so I have oodles of free time.  I really wish I could enjoy TV.

My meds are: Lithium, Latuda, Lybalvi (Olanzapine+), and an occasional PRN of Clonazepam.

Only got to see the therapist once a day, when we did talk it was never about getting help. Psychiatrist talked more about what new pill that they were going to shove down your throat. 

When I did get out, I felt like my life will never be the same. That I'll be stuck reliving what has happened.  I have been stuck on those days. Replying everything in my head. Feeling  alone like I was. Can't eat certain foods because of it. No one in my circle seems to understand what I'm going through. They just tell me that it wasn't that bad. It was to safe my life.

I’d like to do it but I have some concerns, first being that I’m worried that I won’t be a good subject, because I don’t usually wear any jewelry at all so I might be wanting to take it off a lot.

I was hospitalized for one manic episode about six years ago now, and other than that have simply been volatile probably throughout my life with more minor 'manic' periods throughout. 

I know the basic rundown from experience, or the idea that medication is the only way to treat the thing and that it will get dark without it. Gliding back gently to earth naturally seems to be a pipe dream (although I'm sure it's happened to somebody). However, I've been hyper-controlled on the 'good' early portion of things, although I have had the symptoms -- shopping sprees, but this time restrained to clothes I was already going to buy; successfully seducing just about any woman I talk to, but this time not taking things any further than a little flirting; very little need for food or sleep, so forcing myself; walking all over town, but in a health-conscious rather than vagabond kind of way this time.

I genuinely thought I was dying because it lasted 20 minutes and it felt like it was never going to end. It freaked my mom out so much she called an ambulance.

Found myself answering more historically, as questions sometimes asked this way and it really stood out that prior to being diagnosed bipolar and medicated, some of these would be greatly influenced. 

Pressured speech impacts a ton of the conversation ones, racing thoughts the distractibility. Psychomotor agitation for fidgeting. Hypomania for social ones, hell even mania for pattern recognition and imagination and relationship, attraction ones….

Long story short, I scored “on spectrum” and “probably” for ADHD, even with being 100% honest and purposefully answering neurotypical for many. It was very clear having bipolar influenced many of those that could indicate the opposite.

This is why a professional really needs to the diagnosing. The traits are easily mistakable.

Today I had my first intense bout of hypomania with psychotic symptoms in a long time.  Felt buzzing on my skin the walls were moving, voices.  It felt like a bit of a mixed state because I didn't know how to feel.  I swung from panic attacks to feeling confused but high on energy to feeling incredibly sad but still energetic in a bad way.  Like a nervous energy that I didn't know where to direct.

In any case I took my quentiapine before bed and wow it like instantly fixed most if not all the symptoms.  Crawled into bed and had a nice sleep.

775,13zmqau,Still struggling w lost/broken relationships from mania,"My first and only mania happened about 2 years ago. Among other things, during it I rampaged through my phone and email contacts sending a lot of cruel (and, often, painfully true) messages to my friends and relatives. Some worse than others.

In so many ways this experience has actually been a blessing and has sorted my relations in a clear way. Many people immediately forgave me and said, ""I knew it wasn't you."" The relationships that made it through this experience became extremely concretized.

On the other hand, there are others who don't really understand, or got too hurt because what I said was just too far in those instances, or for other reasons.

I still struggle two years out because two of the relationships I lost were two women I considered to be my very best friends. One of them actually just completely ghosted me, never responded to anything, and that was that. It is so hard with her because she is still friends with my sister and they socialize every few months. (My sis says they don't talk about me...which I'm not sure if that makes me feel better or worse). My relationship with my sis is sort of ok, but also feels really damaged because I can't get over the fact that she is chilling with this traitor. For more context the friend was my BFF since 1st grade. My sister only got to know her as a friend in adulthood.

The other friend I lost is diagnosed Bipolar 2. (I'm obviously 1 bc I've had mania). We talked some when I first got out of the hospital, which I appreciated. She said we didn't need to immediately discuss what went down when I was manic bc she just wanted to make sure I was ok. (A kindness the first friend didn't give me, which is shocking and makes me 100% sure it's right she's out of my life....more just tortured that she is friends w my sis). However, once we did start talking I felt that she was extremely defensive and not willing to understand even a crack of my experience or how it could be excused by being completely and utterly out of my mind. Even though she is bp2 and has only had hypomania she said, ""I've had mania before. Several times. Not as intense as yours but I do understand."" This as a way to basically shut me down when I said, ""it just seems like you're not understanding the nature of mania."" I'm frustrated with her for that. I've been hypomanic several times and it is just night and day, the difference, basically not comparable. It was insulting that she said that to me and makes me so mad. I didn't tell her this, I was just kinda like, ""I hear you, and again I am sorry..."" kind of thing. After that conversation I sent her a nice gift in the mail - a brand new sweater and some art supplies and treats for her new cat. She did not acknowledge the gift at all, though I saw she picked it up from the post office. I also sent another email trying to explain more that she did not respond to.

I have such a lack of respect for the just ghosting response. Why can't people say, ""I don't want to talk to you anymore"" or ""I don't want to talk to you now,"" ...and ideally like, ""thanks for trying to reach out / thanks for the $200 gift.""

I am at a point where I am for various reasons including things from before mania, glad that these friends are not in my life anymore. At the same time, it upsets me and causes me emotional disturbance frequently. I am also really mad at my sister for hanging out with my friend.

I am working to walk away and leave it behind me, focus on the many great relationships and opportunities I do have in the present and future. But still. Does anyone have any advice on how I can process this to better move past it, or can relate? The second friend who ghosted me after sending the gift and email I wonder if I should write her again or even call and just be like....""So I just wanted the closure and this is goodbye"" or if I should let her weak, bitch-ass, cowardly response speak for itself.

781,13zz1ls,"Bipolar II, BPD, just unrelenting anxiety and codependency? Who knows, but I'm hoping to share my experience. TW: substance abuse","For pretty much all my life, I've dealt with chronic anxiety. From tummy aches and nightmares as a toddler, to dissociation and panic attacks in my early 20's. I was much more depressed in high school and struggled with a lot of substance abuse. I got some relief when I started college, mainly just because I felt more free and independent. But that's when my struggle with relationships started. 

As concisely as I can put it, I take on the caregiver role very quickly. (I'd like note however that every guy I've dated ended up having severe self-esteem issues and depression.) I would grow to believe I was truly better and smarter than my partner, but that didn't stop my unrelenting anxiety that they would leave me. If they argued with me, said goodnight the wrong way, or maybe just changed their tone in one single sentence - I took it as all out war. I felt abandoned, hurt, attacked, and I would look for every means of escape and every way to get back at them. I would say things I didn't really mean just for the sake of trying to hurt them. I felt trapped inside this horrible monstrous person that didn't feel like me, but it was, wasn't it? Then when it was all said and done, I had no doubts about us. Everything would work out just fine, no matter what came our way. Rinse and repeat. This still goes on even in my current relationship, but to a lesser degree as I'm working on communication skills more actively.

After my last relationship ended (which was pretty mutual), it sent me into becoming a person I didn't know existed. I felt so good about myself, but also felt everything I did was out of my control. I was partying and drinking every night, meeting and hooking up with random people on the internet, sabotaging friendships for no reason, and hardly sleeping. This went on for the better part of 3 months, and then I just..stopped. No depression after, just went back to being normal. This is the closest thing I can think of to ever feeling hypomanic.

When it comes to medications, I tried a ton as a teenager. I was trialed on Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor, and Paxil. Nothing ever did anything for me except give me brain fog. I decided to try Zoloft again a few months ago, and the experience could not have been more different. For two weeks, I felt I was on cloud nine. Everything was better, I was happy, lifted, as close as I could get to euphoric without feeling actually high. Two weeks later, I crashed so hard and spent the entire night telling my boyfriend how I was losing my sense of identity and nothing would ever be better. Then the next day, I was mostly okay, but decided to come off the medication. 

My new psychiatrist says the reaction to Zoloft is an early indicator of bipolar II. She explained that for bipolar, SSRIs immensely exacerbate the highs and lows. Even if I don't experience the intense swaying of moods over long periods of time, she said as a 23 year old female it's pretty much just a matter of time. So I got started on Lamictal, still at the baby dose of 25mg but slowly moving up to 100mg as I adjust. I see so many people on here talk about their unrelenting depression, but I really don't experience it yet. I go a few days feeling good, maybe a few more being super anxious, but I feel my mood swings are a few hours to hours or day to day rather than weeks. Just curious if anyone else is similar. Thanks for letting me vent :)",1,0

785,13zxkre,Recurring dreams,"TLDR: Can an “anxiety dream” that hasn’t been present in 20+ years come back and be a sign of a pending spiral? I’m going through a difficult, but stable time. 

I’m currently stable, however I’m dealing with some fairly significant stress at work and home. I’m coping fairly well. However, last night I had a dream that I ONLY have in times in my life when things are starting to spiral. The dream is that I’m driving and I can’t see and it’s out of control. Nothing catastrophic actually happens. I happen to get to a point where I can acknowledge it’s a dream and force myself to wake up. This is the first time in years, but other times were frequently 24 years ago when I was drinking too much (22). I grew out of that, but used to have bouts of binge drinking during episodes. In the last 5 years I drink a couple of beers twice a year. I’m currently not using any substances.

I suppose I’m wondering if this dream coming back at a time where I do feel like a lot is out of my control and maybe that’s why this exact dream has resurfaced?",1,0
786,13zxe6s,"New manager made me cry. Do I tell her boss (my former boss and mentor) about the interaction, or let it go?","I've been working at my current job in the non-profit sector for nearly 5 years, and for the most part it has been a dream job. I had an awesome boss, great relations with my team, and truly feel like my work makes a difference and matters. Even when I  had a manic episode last year (with psychotic features) my boss was super supportive, kept my confidence about it and didn't make me feel judged at all. I will always be grateful.

If only things could stay that way.

As my boss is at a director level, we recently hired a new manager to help and I had my reservations when it was announced. But after thinking it through and discussing with my therapist, decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and hoped we'd get along and maybe become friends (everyone at my org is very passionate about the work we do, and I hoped we could bond over this).

Because I've been at the organization for so long, I naturally had my own networks and ways of doing things. I've also continued to discuss my projects with my former boss for the most part because we've always worked closely on these items in the past. For a while, it was just him and I. I'll admit I was also a bit intimidated by the new hire because she has a very direct, blunt management style and I was still feeling her out. But I've been friendly and even invited her out to lunch to get to know one another, and I thought it went well. 

We had a 1-on-1 call last week, which I prepared for under the impression we were to discuss our working relationship and ways she could support me as the new manager. I began our call with my typical friendly chit-chat and was immediately cut off.

She then proceeded to tell me, in no uncertain terms, that she found me to be ""disrespectful"" and having an authoritarian attitude (she's been her about a month). Her evidence was that I hadn't been checking in with her enough frequently (I've always had a certain level of autonomy, but had been CCing her on big projects) and she wasn't happy that I had used our online system to request a day off (after working the equivalent in overtime hours) rather than seek permission from her directly. Fair enough? While I can understand her perspective as a new manager, I felt it was handled very poorly.

I'm not proud, but I was completely blindsided by these accusations and immediately burst into tears on the call. I thought I had gone out of my way to embrace her as a team member and help bring her up to speed on my key projects. I have always been nothing but friendly and kind, and have always thought of myself as a team player.

She also told me, going forward I am not to communicate with my former boss, ever, and only go through her. IF he needs to be made aware of something, she'll bring it up to him. I'm to stop all contact.

Obviously, this is also distressing. He's been an incredible support and mentor and now knows my mental health history. After my disastrous call (in which she watched me breakdown with no reaction but total distain for my emotions) I feel at a loss of what to do. 

I definitely don't feel comfortable sharing my diagnosis with the new manager, and now dread our interactions. It also seems to be me she's targeting and not the other staff (who are also relatively newer compared to me). 

A part of me really wants to reach out to my former boss (her boss) and share what happened on the call. I've been obsessing over her use of words ""disrespectful"" and ""authoritarian"" and want to know if he's ever heard of other staff ever describing me like that. But I don't want to burden him, or feel like I'm ""tattling"" on her, so I haven't said anything.

I did call HR immediately after the call because I was near sobbing at how cruel she seemed on the call, and needed help processing. I didn't know what to do. I was so hurt and upset. I'm scared everything is going to change now at work and I feel cut off from my biggest professional support and mentor.

What should I do?",1,0

I've been having panic attacks about work since before I've been off of work. I'm continuing to have panic attacks about going back several times per week.


I also have OCD. The thought of going back just completely terrifies me and idk why. My anxiety has gotten better since before I was medicated, but I'm still having intense anxiety. I just don't think healthcare is for me. This is my 3rd healthcare job and I just don't feel like I can do it. Any advice would be appreciated.

789,13zpxo2,Am I Doing Alright? You let me know,"Hi all! So it's been a while. I was institutionalized following a failed attempt, put on meds, did outpatient treatment for a year THEN my therapist died - I stopped medication for 6 months then I suffered a ""stress induced"" blackout - tried therapy again for about 3 sessions and I've been rawdogging life ever since. That was 2 years ago.

So since then I've gotten really self aware with my moods, my emotions, my episodes and how to 'manage' them. A lot changed - went from surviving to living (toxic positivity gets the job done sometimes) but I was numb. 

I couldn't cry, for close to year. Even when I was in the thick of the shit - that little moment before I couldn't recondition the terrible feeling away, I couldn't cry - nothing. The really good moments were just okay.

Until the past 3 weeks. Where I went from breaking down in tears out of the blue in an office meeting at 9am to having the literal time of my life at festivals and parties with other people and by myself and I mean I was euphoric - like that moment was the happiest I've ever and will ever be & if that is so I will be okay because I had the time of my life.

This past week, I was not well(flu)and not going to work. Wednesday I was preparing to go back into the office and I got triggered by the tiniest non -issue and a had a full breakdown.

By that I mean fetal position, rolling panick attacks that lasted around 10hours and I went mute. I haven't had panick attacks that severe ever and only a few in the past 3 years. The last time I went mute was 5/6 years ago.

I went to the riverside when the attacks ended.... rationalized and explained everything that happened (to myself)- I thought about committing myself to the psych ward for a bit & let that thought go. Thursday, I spent half the day at the office in a constant state of panick/anxiety then found out my beloved friend lost his battle with depression and I went to Karaoke.

At Karaoke, I had THE TIME OF MY LIFE. And I was really sad and terribly drunk - I was feeling EVERYTHING! my emotions,  everybody's emotions - I cried to my ex who broke my heart terribly and after I cried in his arms because I was sad my friend died and I was feeling so much... I was okay. Like I have never felt sadness before in my life. I let a stranger walk me to my car, I got home, slept and woke up to find I had wet the bed. 

And I spent a shit ton of money at karaoke.

But I'm okay now. The sadness of my friends death comes in crashing waves. But I'm okay.

What do you think... should I make the call to the psych ward?

(P.S The funniest part is - for the 2 years I was 'okay', I was okay and dealing with the fact that I was misdiagnosed and had been faking this illness for the past 15 years and worked on healing whatever traits of manipulation or narcissism or trauma that would make me fake bipolar and mental illness or at least have me convince myself and others that l was ill. And guess what - I healed through that too. Made a lot of progress. I was okay.)",3,0

792,13zbl3w,How do you decide if past experiences were hypomania or you just doing weird stuff?,"I'm pending a diagnosis at the moment, and it's got me thinking back through the past few years and looking at things in a more critical light, but there are some grey areas where I can't tell if things I did were just bold or uncharacteristic of me or if they were related to hypomania. 

I'm posting here because I imagine a lot of you can relate to this feeling, whatever the reason is you're looking back, and I'd really appreciate some advice on how you sort it in your own mind. 

Personally, there are times lately that were clearly 'wrong' to me and led me to speak to my doctor. When I look back, before I had that awareness, there are a few big moments that stand out to me as making unusually poor decisions with money without worrying about it, starting uncharacteristic projects, that kind of thing, always when feeling 'not depressed', but I can't recall my energy levels or amount of sleep, etc., because they're a few years in the past and nothing drew my attention to those kinds of flags. I think that alone is enough to make me think they were 'me' and just normal, weird parts of life and being a young adult that I'll never repeat, but I guess I'll never quite know.

I’m nervous about this, I’ve been on 6 different medications in the last year and none of them have worked for me past the 3 month where my mind/body seems to rebel against them and I end up very sick. I need to keep my job, work have been surprisingly supportive and given my access to a mental health fund and allowed my to create a role that suits me in my professional function. But I’m very aware my brain is mush. I’m struggling to take on new information. I’m finding certain subjects and platforms really challenging, eg maths,  fucking Excel! I’ve literally been arguing with my partner over his desire to me to put things into an Excel spreadsheet and get to relearn it. Ffs, my brain has zero internet and trying to make me do it is frustrating for everyone. I’m struggling to be social as trying to ‘be normal’ is exhausting. I’m afraid to drink alcohol as when I was hyper manic I was drinking, smoking not eating properly or sleeping yet had no realisation to what extreme. Also online shopping for all sorts of odd things. When I’m stable I have no desire to smoke or drink the way I was drinking, alcohol I can take or leave until I’m getting hyper and then it’s like I down it like water but don’t realise that is what I’m doing at the time.  I don’t know if I genuinely have an alcohol probably or I develop one due to my state of mind but I’ve been going to meeting regardless to make sense of it. 
I haven’t spoken to my family about my diagnosis or events in the last year. Sort from mother and partner, no one knows the extend of trauma I had growing up. With therapy, I’m pretty sure the starting point for BP and BPD was due to sexual abuse when I was very young. My mother was aware but didn’t take appropriate action or protect me, I thought it was my fault for a very long time and also have been hiding it out of shame because she drummed into me that no one would believe and I must have done something to encourage it. I have confronted her about this. Still, the damage is still there, if anything, the birth of my own daughter in 2021 seemed to drag all my demons out. 
Apologises this is so long. Essentially I’ve been working so so hard to get better but I feel with every step forward I go further down a rabbit hole. My life plans seem out of reach, I hate the zombie I’ve become on medication. Despite my partners support I feel very isolated snd I’m terrified of having another episode. At the moment i’m still very low after the last episode 6 weeks ago. I’m trying to exercise everyday, which helps, and focus on a healthy and sleep but it doesn’t feel enough and I don’t understand my diagnosis yet. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",4,0

Now my relationship with my mom is better than it's ever been, and that is awesome. 

I feel much more spiritually connected to the world than I used to. I have bipolar with delusional tendencies, and the delusions I have while manic are mostly of a spiritual nature. I honestly feel much more at home in the world with this spiritual connection I found through bipolar disorder. 

I'm actually a much better writer than I used to be because of bipolar. I keep a daily journal tracking my mood, energy, mentality, just how I'm feeling and what's going on. Through the years it's evolved from being basic and barebones into being fullblown personal discussions with myself. I feel I have a much more developed sense of self-awarness because of it, and I owe it to being bipolar. 

I'm not saying bipolar is easy, it is a daily struggle for me. But at this point I've found a certain sense of beauty in the struggle of it, and I do believe I'm a stronger and more resilient person because of being bipolar.

829,13yxu4k,Am I just hypomanic and being paranoid? I’m afraid that the people at my car’s dealership snooped through my backpack when I was out of the room. Should I call them to see if they’ll let me review the security cameras?,"Today I went to pick up my car, which has been at the dealership for a month. I sat with the customer service manager in his office (a conjoined desk next to another conjoined desk and a side office), and waited for my parents (who helped pay for the service) to send paperwork. 

I had my backpack, and since it was the end of the day, I put it in an empty seat next to me. 

When the paperwork was sent, he told me to follow him to the front office to get checked out. I went to grab my backpack, but he said that I didn’t have to; that it would only take a few minutes and we’d be right back. I was hesitant, but said ok. At this point, there were no customers in the back of the office, just a few customer service managers and other employees (all of whom were ready to go home).

The checkout process ended up taking longer than was anticipated, because my parents’ card had issues. The manager I’d been working with eventually said he was going back to the office (where my backpack was) to “take care of some things” — likely whatever it was he needed to do before the dealership closed.

I ended up waiting to be checked out for about 20 minutes. That whole time, I had this gnawing paranoia about my backpack being snooped through because I’d left it unattended. 

(Also, as a side note, I could tell that the consensus among the employees was that I was a “daddy’s money” person — which isn’t even the truth — and I could feel the glares they hid under customer service smiles/voices.)

Anyway, I finished, went back to my backpack, and left. 

The reason I am so worried is that I had 2 journals in my backpack, each of which contains very personal entries. Even though everyone there seemed “professional,” and were undoubtedly just thinking about going home, I feel so stupid for leaving the backpack unattended.

My only solace are the facts that 1) when I later opened my backpack, I saw that the journals had been in the same (particular) position I had put them in, and 2) there were cameras pointed directly at my where my backpack was.

I looked up the dealership on Google, and they have a lot of 1 star reviews (despite being rated 4.5+ stars overall), although most of the bad reviews were about bad customer service and gouged prices.

So, what do you guys think? Should I call them to see if I can review the security camera?",2,0

I miss the mural that's been painted over on the building downtown, and the Indian restaurant that closed, and my good friend who worked at the bookstore who moved up North. The college farm I worked at is still there, and the coffee shop manager still runs the joint I used to work at, and my former professor still hosts poetry nights each week.

831,13ywwxr,(Diagnosis Pending) Just Had a Manic Episode for the First Time,"So I came out of a manic delusional episode like a couple weeks ago and am now seeing a therapist who said that until I officially get diagnosed, they'd be treating me as if I had bipolar. I don't know how to feel and I don't know how to deal with the fallout of the episode, as I also experienced some hallucinations/psychosis symptoms that have significantly alienated me from peopl in my life especially family. 

I'm staying with my dad now but feel really icky about everything because during the episode, my actions caused some trauma in the lives of those two and I don't know how to make amends in an appropriate way because I don't want to use the pending diagnosis as an excuse and also I don't think that me attempting to make amends will help them in the long run so I will just take a step back and let them decide how they want to handle it. Honestly my sense of identity seemed so sure during the episode but now that it's over and I'm looking at the carnage and the therapist said it was likely bipolar I don't really know who I am or what kind of person I am anymore. 

I was sometimes curious about the possibility of a mood disorder when I was in high school but having a professional tell me it's likely feels like a whole nother story, as well as seeing the carnage unfold. I've never really done anything like this before - stealing my housemates things because I was sure they were secretly mine/sure that that housemate had it out for me and had done terrible things to me with no evidence. A lot of thieving and having angry, screaming outbursts in the streets over perceived slights as well as having some sort of delusion that that would solve world crises. 

I was convinced that everything I was doing was for some perceived righteous cause and that everyone pushing against me were trying to silence me as some sort of conspiracy. I got banned from my old college campus and sent to a therapists office, but then I just took my umpulsive crime spree elsewhere and got arrested twice - one for setting a fire on the highway, and one for setting onein the rental property of my front yard. It sounds ridiculous now but at the time it made sense. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do with my life. I completely blew everything up and I know it's my fault but I can't fathom for the life of me what the fuck came over me. Where does the sickness (if it's bipolar) end and I begin? How do I bounce back from the consequences? I'm embarassed and ashamed and every morning I wake up and feel depressed and anxious over all this stuff. As I should, I guess. It feels like a righteous karmic principle that I should be in this situation after my actions, especially considering that my former housemate may end up having trust issues over the stealing and privacy invading. The othr side is that I don't want to feed into stigma against bipolar people when/if tht's the diagnosis that comes up? I just don't know how to feel about all this honestly.",2,0

I have type 2 rapid cycling, ADHD combined type, and chronic PTSD, so you can see why I need therapy.

846,13yqz8u,Does it ever get better?,"(long post)

I've been asking myself that question a lot lately. I keep hearing that it gets better, things work out, I just have to keep a positive outlook and find the right meds. But I feel utterly hopeless. My doctors say the meds are working. I don't really feel different, but I've told them that my anxiety meds work for temporary situations. Yet I keep falling into depression over and over again. I feel like the mood stabilisers haven't made me any more stable.

This disorder has taken so much from me that I feel completely useless. Worthless. Meaningless. I'm terrified of the future because I'm in uni and I can't even study right now. I got put on sick leave for three months and it could be extended. I feel unable to study, let alone work, the thought of any of that stuff makes me extremely anxious. I live with my boyfriend and I dread being alone because I don't trust myself.

People say I just need to find something to drive me, a goal or something of the sort. But I have nothing - absolutely nothing - that interests me. And I'm not good at anything. I have no hobbies or skills that could support me financially and make me feel content at the same time. I've convinced myself that I can't do anything and it feels true.

It's probably just the depression talking. I'm diagnosed with BPD as well and I've heard that depression goes unusually deep for us and very quickly so, which I can relate to. But it's been 10 years of the same thing. And I've never felt life without anxiety. I stopped to think about that today, and it really hit me. Lately, everything seems to hit me again and again. The reality of it all. I grew up with severe social anxiety disorder and plummeted into depression at around 12 years old. I'm about to turn 22 and I'm still in the same situation while the ones I used to relate to and get support from all seem to have ""moved on"". It feels like my mindset is still stuck in 2013.

I fear I won't make it another year. I'm overwhelmed. When I was a kid I used to think 26 would be the end for me, because I was terrified of living any longer than that. Now I'm worse than ever.

I experience the itching and the anger the sensory over load AND don’t get me started on noises oh my god it makes me so angry. 

Then I get overwhelmed with just things that are slightly overwhelming to other people but I loose my shit.  I’m struggling. 

Also I’ve started loosing parts of my memory…. When I get overwhelmed or angry I don’t remember parts of things or things I said while feeling like that. It’s almost like blacking out for a few seconds. 

It also takes my brain a few seconds to understand things and I get confused really easily. It makes me feel dumb 

I just listened to my mom tell me for 20 minutes that I’m not ready to do anything because I can’t do the most basic things (like drive) without getting overwhelmed…. Once I get overwhelmed I then get angry. And she also sat there and said I was mean and rude and hateful and basically just an awful person and that no one was going to wanna be around me and I was going to end up lonely. 


I’m exhausted idk what to do.",7,0

Back in April I started seeing a new doctor because my psychiatrist of 10 years proved to me that I am now a number and not a patient. Dumb healthcare. I love this new doctor because she’s female and she’s been able to see my disorder through the added lens of being postpartum which can make make a child bearing person have more intense and more frequent mood episodes between birth to 4 years, most regulate their hormones by the 2 year mark. Well, with her I went back on a low dose of Adderall for my ADHD and prior to that we’ve decreased my Depakote from 750 to 500mg. All my other meds have stayed the same.

**NO FUCKING SELFIES. THIS WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE BAN. NO PERSONAL INFO. INSTANT BAN.**

Tis simple. No photos of faces that are identifiable. This includes faces with pets. Selfie bans are in our opinion for your own safety. I also recommend you delete all photos of your face in relation to our sub. You can keep them up if you want, I think you should delete. Plenty of people get doxxed on reddit from various places. I am not a fan of putting our users at risk in that way. Do whatever you want other places, but not here. It also takes away from users that need help.

NEW ACCT RULES

We have instituted a 30 day new account review for all new accounts. This is to protect our user base from banned users. We have been harassed and brigaded. I wont go into the specifics, but this is necessary to keep the community safe.

What this means: All posts and comments go through our mod queue. We approve them as appropriate at a human rate.

Please do not message us from new accounts asking to approve your posts. We are doing that as fast as we can.

If you want to become an approved user prior to 30 days, we need you to message us from the account you would like to use and then your alt account which we will review. If you have zero history and no alt account, then all posts will be reviewed until your account is at least 30 days old. Basically, you need an acct with reasonable positive or neutral history.

884,qdb3yv,We have a debilitating disease but it is not an excuse.,"I struggled with this concept early in my diagnosis, and I’m sure many of you have as well. It’s easy to hear that there is something mentally wrong with you, and to run with that card and play it to your advantage. 

Yes. We have a mental illness that can be debilitating and destructive. It can be unpredictable, and with that comes with what seems like a never ending rollercoaster of ups and downs. The outbreaks, the anger, the irritability, the irrationality, the depression, the mania — it’s A LOT, but it gets thrown at the people around us. We may not mean it, we may feel out of control of our bodies, however, you are 100% in charge of your health. 

**NONE of this is an excuse for when you take your emotions out on another person.** 

It is not your partners fault when you are out of control. It is not your mothers fault when you cannot contain your rage. You are not a helpless victim who has any sort of free pass, right, or privilege, to treat someone like shit when you are having an episode. You are at fault if you do not accept responsibility for your action(s) or words after a breakout. If you disrespect or hurt someone, you must take ownership of that, apologize…every single time. You will not learn how to manage your disease and live a healthy life if you expect that people are going to put up with the bullshit that sometimes comes out, with us, because *you have bipolar disorder.* It’s not a pity party, it’s not an excuse. It’s a disease that needs **managed** 

Importantly, it is your responsibility to educate your loved ones on *your mental illness.* It is absolutely vital to inform them of your side effects when down, when up, in the moment (if you are there yet). It’s healthy to communicate the good, the bad, and the ugly. It’s your job to notice when something is wrong. You can’t expect people to just “get it.” 

Bipolar disorder is about honesty and transparency, whether with yourself or another person. Are you medicating properly? Have you noticed your medicine not working the same, and taken initiative to contact your doctor? Are you actively seeking support when you need it? Do you **acknowledge when you need help?** 

Rome wasn’t built in a day, and these things take time, but you and those around you know when you are doing the best that you can. If people in your life refuse to try and understand this disease and hold it against you, that is something *you* need to address, cut them out if necessary, 

Listen to your body and mind. 

Communication diffuses 99% of situation — **speak your truth!** 

Find support when it’s necessary. 

Show up to your appointments. 

Participate in your therapy, actually participate. 

Be teachable and be transparent. 

I promise you, that managing this disease is so much easier when you are doing all the right things. It’s not going to be right all the time, but that’s okay, because you know how to learn from your experiences and use them for improvement instead of making them an excuse. 

Stay strong lovelies. I hope this resonates with someone. You got this 🖤",49,0

I became so intrigued in why these medicines that were supposed to be balancing the chemicals in my brain always made me feel sluggish or gained weight or even lactated. I thought that doesn’t seem balanced to me. After reading paper after paper after paper I found that people who maintain a keto diet who have been diagnosed with bipolar don’t have nearly as severe of mood swings as they did while on a traditional diet. It has something to do with the body’s inability or super efficiency to use glucose (usually carbohydrates or sugar) as energy. I started doing keto and aerobic exercise and no longer have mood swings and am not on meds I feel like I have my life back. What do you guys know or think?

893,12jw4lt,My New Neighbors Smoke Weed A Lot & I Think It's Triggering My Psychosis,"I've lived in my apartment for almost 4 years and over the winter, new neighbors moved in above me. 

I started to notice that smoke/odors (nicotine & weed) were coming through the ventilation system into my bathroom shortly after they moved in, and I eventually had to report them to the manager. I don't know what personal consequences they faced but a complex wide email went out reminding residents that there was no smoking of any kind in buildings or within 200 feet of residences which means smoking is also not allowed on balconies.

Everybody smokes on their balconies, and management really never followed through. Now that is nice out, the neighbor above me is on the balcony smoking weed 5+ times a day, nearly every day. It's coming in through my window, which is open because I want to enjoy the gorgeous spring weaths like a normal person. 

The major issue is this - my auditory hallucinations are WAY worse now that they smoke on their balcony, and I don't know if it's stress or from the second hand smoke. I'm also ill every morning from spending so many hours straight in my stinky room. I have an air filter, and I am not putting my AC on in April because of people breaking law. 

Has anybody else dealt with secondhand smoke from weed & their bipolar?

UPDATE: I have shut my window and discovered the problem is still with my bathroom ventilation. I don't think I can explain how much this guy smokes and how much my room reeks. I thought it might be a window thing because spring just hit MA, and I've had my window open for 4 days. But the smoke is *definitely* still coming in through my master bath as it was in the colder months. I contacted the building manager because they need to fix the ventilation and address that we live in a marijuana-free apartment. He is smoking regular cigarettes on the balcony which is why I thought he was smoking other stuff out there, too.",2,0

I am neither anti-medication nor anti-psychiatry. I realize both that medication is life-saving for a lot of of people and that its a privilege to not be dependent on it. I know a lot of bipolar people wanna quit becauce they think they are cured due to no symptoms showing at the moment. However- that doesnt mean its right for everyone with bipolar, at every moment of their life! All medications I have tried (except serroquel for sleep) have fucked me over, a lot more than raw dogging life. I always end up dissociating, like a zombie, and it genuenly feels a lot worse than when i dissociate while depressed. I do feel this might change in the future, where medication might be more right for me. I still have depressions that makes me dysfunctional and suicidal, highs that shake up my life and unstability- but it still is a life I enjoy more than when I'm medicated. Same with quitting alcohol, marijuana, never doing other drugs- everyone is different and complete stability is not worth it at every cost- for every one (even though its most bipolar peoples goals).

898,8vrfgg,If you aren’t diagnosed bipolar...,"..And are contemplating about putting your full life story on here in hopes of all of us giving you advice- DON’T!!!

I’m sorry but I am fucking sick of people coming on here and posting their dumb stories that aren’t even closely related to bipolar then they ask if they are. When I was diagnosed I didn’t even know what the fuck bipolar was and my doctor had to explain it to me. I also didn’t fully understand it for months because I was diagnosed while full blown manic and could not focus or retain any information or even understand the depth of the illness.

I feel like I suffered extreme depression and severe mania to be given this diagnosis. I have invisible battle wounds and have fought many battles in my life where I didn’t even think I’d survive. It was soooo hard to function in either extreme mood. I was on disability bc I couldn’t go into work manic.

It really bothers me when people come on here and are like “I get mad then I get really happy SO I must be bipolar” it’s like no bitch... get off Reddit, go to a fucking doctor, and sit on the couch like the rest of us. 

Holla to all my bipolar peeps. Shits rough but we got this.

Sorry I’m not sorry about my rant. I’m for reals annoyed. I enjoy talking to my BP peeps and relating about our illness. Good and bad. Memes are the best!!

I was just attention seeking because I was in a happy weird mood. I said things that might’ve sounded like delusions but I was really just saying crazy things for the fun of it, because it sounded amusing to me at the time. I talked really fast because I was hyper.

I have been on an antipsychotic and lithium for over a year now. I haven’t had a return of this weird happy mood but that’s not the point. I know deep down I don’t have bipolar but my doctor says I shouldn’t come of the medication because it might cause a return of symptoms. I have tried to explain I don’t have bipolar but because of this hyper time being in my records he doesn’t believe me.

904,10mzvhz,LIVID AF,"Update: these were not adults. All parents have to sell tickets from both teams on a rotation. It was NOT a scene, it was in the ticket tower (like a shed) that has windows and doors which were CLOSED as soon as I got inside the tower. I didn’t “take over” i was asked to help because I worked the game Tuesday and everything went just fine because I did what I was told and what they showed us at training. Instead the 4 parents in the ticket booth (that dodge ticket duty every other game) didn’t give it time to set up, the game was already underway and 40+ people were waiting in line behind the rails until the ticket system was up and ready (which I had to set up). These same parents don’t pick up their kids from events and we always take the stragglers home. There is a history of laziness and entitlement on their end and it affected all spectators because they had to stand behind the fence until the ticket booth was open. 

As I’m explaining what to do, I was agitated. I wasn’t yelling, or slamming things, and as much as I wanted to cuss, I held it and said “freaking” instead. That’s when my husband said “stop it”. Again, I wasn’t livid or out of control! This further exacerbated the situation because I know how I can get once I’m past the point of agitation but this wasn’t one of those times. The restraint I showed, shows me that I’ve grown but the “stop it” put me right back in the RED!

Once it was up and running, I apologized for sounding condescending because I was. They apologized for day drinking too long and not getting it set up in time and they thanked me for the help and we parted ways cordially and went and cheered on the team. 

I’m NOT perfect. BP is new to me! I was mad when I wrote the original post and should’ve explained it better. I am on meds, in therapy, and do the best I absolutely can do every fucking day, forgive me if I fall short, not perfect and never claimed to be. 

Thanks to all of you who gave me constructive comments, supportive comments, and encouragement… I truly appreciate it! Also, my husband apologized when we got home. He said that he should’ve redirected me differently, but he also said that I get a specific tone when I’m amping up for a meltdown and when he heard that tone, he panicked thinking I was about to go OFF, and all he could get out was “Stop it”! (That’s fair) His goal was to distract me long enough to figure out that I was getting sarcastic OR worse case, get mad at him and not them and take one for the team. (So to speak). It backfired somewhat but after talking through it, we came up with a way to diffuse the situation if it comes up again (it will anytime these 4 parents work the gate)! 

My original post was looking for ways to get through a rapid cycle and still function. Everyone is NOT going to cater to my mood and they shouldn’t! I have to learn how to function even in bad moments. As well as my husband’s “stop it” comment, but I think I explained that a little bit better too. I’m currently not mad at 7 in the morning lol.  Easier to explain with a cool head and probably gives a clearer picture of what was going on at the time. (I hope 🤞)

Y’all also taught me that no matter what, own your shit and do better, so thank you! Might I also suggest that all though I’m new to this board, we may want to show a little Grace when our fellow BP sufferers reach out, tough love and facts are needed but dang, the name calling and prejudgement that I’m some unhinged bitch couldn’t be further from the truth. I come to Reddit when BP hits me with something new or I’m struggling with something in particular…my therapist is amazing but who better than a community of your peers too?? Just keep that in mind for all of us, please! Thanks again, time to move on and have a productive Saturday!! 

Good day to you all!! ✌️ 

Help me out Reddit Friends! I’m a rapid cycler and having quite the time today! But here’s why I’m about to lose my shit!!

My husband literally told me to “Stop It” like you would a child! I was getting agitated at the ticket gate of our daughters game because the link wasn’t working and the sorry ass Stadium employees were about as incompetent as they come! So after I go behind the counter and literally show them how to reboot the system etc. I made the comment “y’all really need to have this together before 100 people are trying to get into a stadium, that’s F- ing ridiculous” NOTE: I said f*ing…not the whole word! 

He whips around and goes “STOP IT”! Ummm WTF?! Was I out of line? His response when we got in the stands was “You have GOT to control yourself, I never know when you’re going to “BLOW”….again, WTF?!? 

Am I taking this wrong? Or did he literally chastise me like a child, then give me that subtle “dig”!!!!

905,tbg35i,Decided I don’t have bipolar,"Doc diagnosed me about a year ago, and assigned me all sorts of meds. I’ve had the typical symptoms: depression, slight mania, violent tendencies, psychosis. But i think my diagnosis is wrong

At the time I was going through big life changes, I was gaslit, verbally abused at a toxic work place and fired, my finances were in shambles, and I was isolated by everyone because I was no longer the nice hardworking girl people knew.

It made me think anyone with the same problems as me then would start having these reactions, and there really was nothing wrong with me. In fact the meds from the doc seemed to exacerbate my symptoms at first. But after a year of trying other meds I am still depressed/ hallucinating from time to time.

Im starting to think my friends and family were right and there’s no mental illness, just a really bad place in life/quarter life crisis.  I’m gonna try convince my doc I don’t need meds anymore.

What do you guys think?

Edit: I’m tired of being the “crazy” person. 

If I am myself or be honest with family, friends, or work, even if it’s just a little bit, it freaks them out so bad (I tried). So here I go trying to suppress any “abnormal” behavior, convincing people I’m normal. If I be myself I just offend or scare people with my words or actions 

When I tell doctors nothings wrong, they seem to find something to worry over.

When I feel like I need help, I have to convince family and friends thats something wrong and they don’t believe me. I just can’t win.

I just want to be normal. I feel gaslit by friends saying I’m normal, and doctors saying I’m not. Im sick and tired of this endless cycle of doubting myself and driving myself crazy. 

That’s why I want to do a hard reset. No meds, no docs, for everyone and myself to see who’s right. I feel like I can’t trust anyone or my own judgement until all playing field is levelled",0,0

911,62lj1y,i Refuse to see mania as a mental illness,"After being diagnosed as Bipolar and put in hospital for manic episode, and being forced to take medication(lithium), I still believe that mania is a profound experience that is more related to spirituality and unlocking of the unconscious mind.

There are so many things that I could ACTUALLY do during mania way better than non-mania that its astonishing to me really. This is just from a functioning perspective of the body and the ability of the mind.

I was able to play basketball better than ever, I was able to sing better than ever, I was able to drive better than ever, I was able to talk to people better than ever. And these were not delusions, these were things that I actually did during mania.

Then there is the spiritual/mind aspect of mania, that I went through this phase of destroying the ego. After first couple days of mania, I felt that I was invincible and basically could do pretty much anything, and I would look down on ""mere mortals"" that do not have the ability that I possess, however, I felt that this is merely a gift and not something I worked for. So I gradually shifted my thinking and stopped taking everything for credit. After this, I would be able to see beauty in everyone and everything. It was truly amazing, one simple example is girls I guess. Before, I did not want to associate myself with ugly girls, but after, I was able to see everyone as beautiful individuals.

Everything is perfectly well until the delusions. I must say that looking back at those delusions, one must think those are some crazy/psychotic thoughts. However, I think its just the brain being over creative and trying to use its energy to create and connect scenarios in my life and making these delusional thoughts.

Mania also feels like pure bliss, which is something that I don't think drugs can even replicate, its a fundamental happiness that comes from within, and it permeates throughout the body, it truly feels amazing.

One problem I have with people who have bipolar is that they always overspend, I think that during mania, physical possessions really do not have that much value like how society portrays, so people actually buy what they always wanted to buy, and if he/she has the money to do so, why not? 

Anyway, thats my experience

923,gtsaug,"I really, really hate bipolar drugs.","By definition, they are drugs. They are not medicine, because they castrate you and your mind. If you’re in the “meds are good for me” camp, please ignore this post; I’m posting to talk to other anti-psychiatry people here. I also don’t care if I get downvoted because downvotes are about as real as mental “illness” (google “Thomas Szasz” if you want more on that).

I got in a huge fight with my parents today over bipolar drugs (“meds,” “medication,” etc) and I’m still at a loss. I quit taking Lexapro recently—my “doctor” gave the okay—and there have been a lot of symptoms, more than I remember there being with Lexapro. Mostly brain zaps. But also extreme irritability regarding the drugs they have me on. It’s very strange. I feel like I’ve been encased in stone (read: drug use) and I can feel the stone starting to crack now that I’m not nearly so drugicated (lol).

Don’t get me wrong: I have, without a doubt, white coat syndrome, but only for psychology, psychiatry, etc. I feel like mind-related professions are pseudoscience and are used to enforce social control upon many people with quote unquote mental “illnesses.” But also, white coat syndrome occurs for a reason: doctors *are* fallible, don’t possess perfect knowledge, and so on.

I realize that a lot of this may sound combative or hostile toward you and drug (“med”) use. I just deeply, deeply hate psychotropic drug use, especially the kind of drug that is produced in a lab, by a company, for-profit (in the corporate sense, not the drug dealer sense), to be sold as a band-aid for people’s problems, and to chemically strap people to the beds of their minds. Because that’s what it is: chemical constraints, restraints. I feel like I’m strapped to a metal bed that’s as hollow as I am. It’s hell. I’m numb and empty and on and on. The worst part of bipolar (I refuse to call it a disorder because you cannot classify disorder) is that people force you to take the drugs and, as a result, keep you away from the enjoyable part of bipolar. In the end, and in my experience, all I’m left with is the dregs of it. No joy. Stripped and hosed like an inmate—in my own goddamn mind, no less. 

Again, I’m not here to argue. I am who I am and am not interested in changing my mind about this. I have lived almost half my life on psychotropic drugs and they do jack shit apart from making me miserable and literally keeping me down. And yet I don’t have a choice. I’m not part of the one percent, nor am I Kanye, so I can’t spend my life hemorrhaging money in a hospital because I believe bipolar drugs to be ethically wrong. My psychiatrist once told me no one was making me take the drugs. It was the most obscene thing I’ve ever heard her say. Basically spitting in my eye. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say—or maybe ask—is how many of you think similarly on this? I’ve lurked here for a bit and it’s mostly pro-drugs rhetoric, thoughts, memes, etc. I feel that anyone with bipolar who isn’t angry about it doesn’t fully understand what’s *being done to them*: mental castration.

Lastly, if it isn’t already clear, I’m just venting a little and really do hope that some people feel the same way. I’m sick of people in my life fellating psychiatry. And also, to give more background and my “bipolar street cred,” I’ve been hospitalized 3 times, avoided a 40 day court order, and have blacked out a few times. I’m also a great pianist when manic, from what I’ve heard at least.",2,0

926,rdn897,I stopped taking medication and I feel fine..,"Reading through the posts in this subreddit, I feel like my story seems uncommon, so I wanted to share it and see if anyone shares the same thoughts.  


I've been diagnosed BPD I mid 2015. That made a lot of sense since I've been having weird behaviors and at the time I didn't even know or understand mental illnesses since I live in a third world country in Africa in which mental illnesses are the last of concerns.  


I refused to take medication because I was in denial and not convinced over the whole deal. However it got to a point where I couldn't function properly.. skipping school for months just staying in my room blocking the door with a sofa so no one gets in, passing out several times from lack of food, many failed attempted suicide, the list goes on.. Then I finally accepted it and started taking medication regularly. At first, it felt good, it seemed like I'm getting my shit together. That with graduating high school (which is a big deal in my country) it seemed the right path to take.   


I spent years on meds however it came to a point where I didn't feel like myself. I didn't want to be that way, numb and soulless. I wanted to go back to adventuring while manic, seing and believing weird shit that didn't exist. Spending several nights up thinking about how I'm gonna be rich and take control over my country and making it a crypto heaven, what would I do if I was a ninja, and how would I come up with a cure for cancer using programming.   


Here I am right now, 23 years old, no medication, no therapy, I do drugs, drink also smoke. I'm embracing the way I am with it's goods and bads. That's what defines me. I love myself!

929,at429m,Quit taking my meds. Best decision of my life.,"Let me preface by saying, this generally is not a good idea and should probably be done under the care of a doctor. Also, what I'm about to say is an unpopular opinion in the mental health community. 

I've[f24] had mental health struggles since I was about 11. On and off meds, in and out of therapy, hispitalizations, abusive relationships, drug use, you name it. Fast forward to my current bf of two years who is basically a ray of sunshine; positive outlook on life 24/7 and never really gets upset even when I am. 

He is very anti-meds simply because he doesnt understand what it's like to not be able to control those types of thoughts and emotions. I went through a period of, ""wow, what's wrong with me? Why cant I fix myself? Why do I need to rely on meds?""

I had an incident in Oct 2018 and my doc basically drugged me up. Maybe not the best idea but that's what happened. Part of me said, ""ok this is what I need to be normal,"" and the other part said, ""why?"" So I weaned myself off the meds and stopped taking them. (Definitely dont stop cold turkey) 

The first month was hard. I'm NOT a cryer. Cant remember the last time I even shed a tear and during that month I was crying randomly. BUT, I was feeling emotion and that's ok. It's been 3ish months and do I still have outbursts? yes. Is it okay? Yes. Everyone on this earth feels emotion and nobody is perfect. 

I am in no way trying to undermine mental illness or recommend that any of you stop taking your meds. We are all different and that's my point. I'm just sharing my story. It's okay to have emotion. You are okay the way you are. 

Tl;dr stopped taking meds and it was a good choice for me. Realized having my emotions was okay. ",0,0

I’m trying to explain something that happened to me yesterday.r/Christianity seems to be split. Can angels still impregnate humans?
I was having a conversation with my psychiatrist and I was trying to tell him that I had sex with an angel yesterday afternoon and he was telling me I was in psychosis and I explained that I wasn’t because I felt very calm and don’t as angry.I’m not calm when I was psychotic.I’m usually scared and crying.


I had spent all night waiting for my angel to come but they didn’t show up again then I got another message an hour ago saying they were going to come a 3:30 but they didn’t say am or pm.so I’m waiting.I told a friend that the angel tried impregnating me twice and they told me I was probably touching myself or having been on hormones I was probably having some sensation of a sexual nature.both my friend and my psychiatrist are worried despite me feeling better than normal.

Any way I can explain to him that this is a belief and spirituality thing and not a delusion psychosis thing?",1,0

948,ld6w6y,"I (29F) did NOT open up about being bipolar to someone I was dating, and it was the best decision I ever made. Here's why:","So I had recently found myself back in the dating game, OH what a fun place to be 🙄😂.

Those of you who are in your 20s and on the dating apps can probably relate: It’s mostly full of 👻s, dead-ends and rejection if you are ultimately looking for a relationship with substance that will last.

So when I finally hit it off with someone, I got excited. We saw each other for a couple months and I never shared with him that I was bipolar.

I didn’t share because I had never met this guy and I unfortunately, like many others, felt like I had to prove that I was “normal” and not crazy. Which IS crazy, because I live a completely normal life and I’m proud of who I am.

So the longer I waited, the more difficult it became to bring it up. I did some research to see if others in my position were facing a similar dilemma, and they were. Of course they were.

I found that we were all scared.

Scared of being rejected simply because of an outdated stigma that is still sadly very, very present in our society today.

So it inspired me to create a mental health awareness instagram and speak out publicly about my mental health because I want to prove to the WORLD 🌎 that you can be “normal” and have a mental disorder.

Actually, you are probably MORE normal if you have a mental disorder with the fucked up state of our world. (And if so, please seek help- most therapy copays are covered bc of the pandemic)

I respect that we all have vastly different experiences and need to open up on our own time. But if you do have a mental illness, I encourage you to join me in starting the conversation so that we can pave the way for people to own their mental health and not be afraid anymore.💪🏼

And selfishly… You will never have to worry about telling another damn soul about it for the rest of your life. And that might be the most freeing feeling thing in the world ✌🏼🦋☮️😘✨",0,0

954,28dgq1,"Spouse of recently diagnosed bipolar, can't get over seeing it as a weakness (read before you downvote)","I'm having a lot of difficulty being supportive for my wife seeing as how bipolar runs in my family too (medicated and everything) and our side dealt with it naturally, we don't take meds, we go through our ups and downs and ultimately I feel like we're more dynamic people for it. GRANTED, from the looks of things this is like a 0.00001% chance.

**Preface**:
Warning: this is my own personal opinions/viewpoints and I feel it's relevant to how I'm approaching my problem.

The way I see both my bipolar and my family (father and mother's side) member's bipolar diagnoses is that we are very up when we're up and we're very down when we're down but ultimately we accept that life goes on and if you want to end it, no one's stopping you (or shouldn't - not a popular opinion that you own you're right to life).

Our up swings further our success beyond what we normally feel like we could comfortably achieve and when we're down we just HAVE to get out and it motivates us to seek relief from whatever is upsetting us and it forces us to accept it unlike others who may be able to suppress it.

**Problem**:
Enter my wife. [insert everything every husband has said in this subreddit about how loving they are because they're so insecure that they're being properly supportive]. I support the shit out of my wife like it's a professional sport to the point where my side of the family has accused me of being an enabler of her depressive episodes where she doesn't do anything - may be true, I don't know what to do though.

Besides being molested, physically abused, verbally abused, being hypersexual - but always monogamous with us, she continues to suffer from crippling anxiety in social situations and any situation involving any amount of responsibility. She was recently diagnosed bipolar shortly before disconnecting from her verbally and physically abusive family (all the way into her teen years before college where we met).

I'm worried because before we got into therapy she seemed to be approaching her problems like a problem-solver... cause and effect, methodical, etc. She was trying new things and feeling them out. Now that she's been diagnosed bipolar it seems like she's totally inwardly focused about how she's feeling and is constantly anxious about a meltdown (which I saw virtually none of our whole relationship until the diagnosis). I worry because I know her to be the type of person where if someone said to her ""oh my god! did you know you're blue?"" she would believe them.

Now I'm not saying she isn't bipolar. What I am saying is that the way it has been presented to her is as a problem and not a potential trait or something that you manage and try to forget about once you're feeling better. Just last night after a wonderful day (she admitted), she came to bed at 4 AM (I go to bed earlier because of work), woke me up squeezing me so hard and then started sobbing. All I did was tell her it's ok and squeeze her back - supportive husband.

Inside though... I... can't... STAND... this. People do not just break down crying for no reason. I've been taught that it's a biological reaction in your brain and if that's the case it's in response to something, whether it be an imbalance or something else, ultimately it's caused by something and she's already been on medication for an appropriate enough time for it to have an effect. I know deep down that she's just not accepting either her childhood, her lost love ones, etc, GRANTED.... she had it fucking terrible growing up but I didn't marry someone with PTSD and didn't want to be someone who had PTSD and all the bipolar stuff has caused is for her to ""be at peace"" with being miserable.

**Where reddit comes in...**
I can accept that I'm probably an asshole but I hope that reddit can accept that I'm an asshole doing his best since I don't show my wife how affected I am by this because she's ""going through it"". Ultimately, I feel like I need advice on how to do my job and put myself first because I feel like if I let her... she would drag both of us down in terms of time, money, etc. trying to pull herself out of her imagined hole. I want to help her, but according to her and everything I've ever read online, it's something that the other person has to figure out on their own.... but if that's the case, what if they don't figure it out? Is their SO just fucked? /rant",0,0

But we are still mentally ill and being taken advantage of even if we may not perceive it like it at first.

This is the unique thing when you are manic and hypersexual. It is a state of mental illness that wants to fuck, but every person you sleep with is in theory raping you?

Additionally if we are making the moves to getting us laid we might not mean it.

I am not trying to move this into a space where it would not be punished if a manic person commits sexual assault. I am not trying to justify those actions. But I have yet to have this talk with someone who has BPD where we might not consent to our own actions.

Sure you can love the mania and what it does and find the experience to be positive, I am not judging.

This is a topic for people who suffer from mania so it is not a BPD exclusive thing.

978,r48mq6,Hypomania is the Kundalini energy rising,"Hypomania is a fantastic state of being as all of you who've experienced it well know. It makes you energetic, powerful, creative and sexual. This is the exact same symptoms the yogis of India have been talking about and seeking to achieve through yogic practices for hundreds of years. They refer to is as the Kundalini.

The famous Carl Jung wrote a book named ""The psychology of Kundalini yoga in 1932 and attributed manic phases to this energy that lies dormant in most of us at the base of our spine.

""Kundalini yoga presented Jung with a model of something that was almost completely lacking in Western psychology--an account of the development phases of higher consciousness.... Jung's insistence on the psychogenic and symbolic significance of such states is even more timely now than then.""

""In India,” Jung says, “the serpent is at the basis of a whole philosophical system, of Tantrism; it is Kundalini, the Kundalini serpent” (1977: 322). According to Jung, “This is something known only to a few specialists, generally it is not known that we have a serpent in the abdomen” (1977: 322-3).""

It is a true superpower which is very very difficult for a human being to control within themselves without a well versed and wise teacher and community around them to guide the way. 

If we learn to control this energy inside us and lead it with great awareness through our whole spinal column and through our seven main chakras we will be able to live lives of unfattomable extacy and creative power. But if we use this power in sexual promiscuity, for our own selfish needs and desires it will quickly burn through our whole body and mind, resulting in long stagnant periods of inertia or depression. 

When you feel this energy is rising, you sleep less, eat more, create more and are more horny. Instead of following all that flow in an unconcious way, start meditating alot. Be by yourself in nature. Ground yourself by walking barefoot, hug trees, swim in the ocean, eat clean and abstain from sex. Otherwise demons will come for your energy, mislead you, eat you up and leave you like and drenched cloth.

All humans have the possibility to be bipolar. We all have the feminine and masculine energies dancing around inside us, but few have come so far in their spiritual development as to start awakening and raising these energies from the root chakra up to our higher chakras. 

Everyone in this sub: you should be proud of yourselves! You are spiritual warriors with great hearts that have come so far in your journey of life that you are lifetimes ahead of most of your neighbouring brothers and sisters.

I have definitely experience serious bouts of depression before but I can’t directly point to a hypomanic episode. I have had periods of time where I spend lots of money, hypersexuality, am agitated and highly irritable, excessive drug/alcohol use, high motivation/goal oriented behavior, positive mood etc. But is this just me trying to feign off or prevent my depression? Was I just in a good place mentally and then got bored and decided to do these things impulsively just to regret it later?  Are these perhaps just coping mechanisms and not necessarily hypomania? I can’t say if I’ve necessarily slept less during those periods, I don’t remember. I can recall periods of time where I slept 5-6 hours a night in contrast to my usual 10? But hardly ever any less than that. 

I had been on Abilify and Wellbutrin XL since that last depressive episode, and I haven’t had any mood episodes hypomanic or depressive, since. Even now, and I’ve been off of my meds for almost 2 months

. My therapist said that often times medication can be very diagnostic and my positive response to meds most likely signals a chemical imbalance, ie bipolar disorder.

I have also heard however that especially in the United States, bipolar disorder is very over-diagnosed.

So basically am I just thinking about it all too much and I’m probably bipolar? Does it seem like it could be something else? Maybe only time will tell now that I’m off meds?

992,7syu3k,Bipolar is NOT a genetic brain disease. Here’s why.,"I’m sure everyone knows what bipolar is so I won’t bother explaining it. There has been research suggesting that bipolar as an overall illness causes brain damage. This isn’t the case and here’s why. 
1. The studies aren’t nearly big enough to be conclusive. Most of the studies I looked at had very few people in them. The largest study I saw that observed the brain of bipolar patients was 99 people. Compare this to the 6 million people that have bipolar disorder, and you’ll see how ridiculous it is. 
2. Relating back to the previous point, every single study used a particular type of bipolar. That being Bipolar 1. The most severe, damaging, and destructive kind of bipolar. The reason why this is important is that you have to remember what people with bipolar 1 actually do. They’re 6 main things that destroy and damage the brain. 
A. Obesity 
B. Cigarettes (or any and all drugs for that matter)
C. High blood pressure. 
D. Head trauma (car crashes, blows to the head, stroke etc) 
E. Diabetes. 
F. Neurological disorders (ALS, cerebral Palsy etc) 
And guess what? People with bipolar disorder (especially BP1) have a tendency for 3 of these. Those being b, e, , and c. All of which cause severe brain damage. 
Now listen, I’m not saying bipolar is necessarily good for you. It can certainly damage yourself and others. But it’s probably not going to cause Brain damage. Especially if you have any other kind of BP except BP1. All brain damage is more of a consequence of the actions a person takes while manic/depressive than it is of the mania and depression itself.

Try me. Try unemployment risks facing almost **every** mental patients out there. Try having constant paranoia, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and isolation. Try struggling getting through each day, just to keep breathing and staying sane until the light goes down?

1002,27l1rq,"I'm about to get involved with a married woman. I know the consequences, I just don't care.","**THE STORY**


I’ll get right down to it.  Here’s the story:  A few months ago, a woman sent me a friend request on facebook.  I noticed that she was from my local gym, so I naturally accepted.  She started liking my posts and commenting on them.  I did the same.  I saw sadness in her soul.  Right away I knew she was the kind of person I could easily identify with.  One day she told me that my comments were the highlight of her day.  After that, I invited her to text me whenever she wanted and we became friends.  I wondered if maybe this could be a potential girlfriend, but those thoughts were dismissed the minute I saw her profile pics with her 2 children and husband.
Soon after we started texting each other she started dropping me hints.  She started talking about how she’s on her 2nd marriage and how she felt she still hadn’t picked the right person.  Later, she reviled that their relationship has never been the same since he cheated on her.  It felt good that there was someone out there who trusted me enough to be open about such a thing.  The more we talked, the stronger the hints became.  One day she told me she wanted to cuddle with me.  I replied, “You’re married.  You have 2 kids.  We are nothing more than friends. But this was a long time ago, and things since then have changed.


She said she understood and for a very long time we remained friends.  I knew that she still liked me.  I just wasn’t attracted to her.  The more we talked, the closer we became.  I offered her emotional support, while she did the same for me.  It wasn’t until I opened up about my depression that I became emotionally connected to her, and it wasn’t until I had a dream that I physically wanted her.
When I told her about my depression, she was ok with it.  She even admitted that during her divorce with her first husband, she was on antidepressants as well.  It turned out we both has a similar past; mothers who yell and fathers who drink.  She knew I was unemployed, she knew I was broken beyond repair, yet she still made me feel like the most amazing person in the world.  She thought I was brilliant, creative and funny.  She laughed at all my ridiculous jokes and was amazed by my story ideas.  She did not care about my depression, she loved what was best about me, what I thought was best about me.  I didn’t have to try to be someone else, I could talk about mathematics and although she couldn’t wrap her head around it, she listened anyways.  An emotional connection had been forged, a feeling of intimacy was born that I hadn’t felt in over 16 years.
I started becoming attracted physically to her after she told me that she’d had 3 sex dreams about me.  At first I did not know how to react to it.  She was married.  I couldn’t get involved with a married woman, so I told her and dismissed it once again.  That very same night, something weird happen.  I had a sex dream about her.  It was absolutely amazing.  I woke up with morning wood that cut straight through my undies, pj’s and comforter.  It was the kind of wood that lasted so long you’d wonder if you should contact a doctor.  That’s how “wow” that sex dream was.  After I shared my feelings with her, she was ecstatic.  “Nothing but smiles”, she would say.   We decided to start planning a way we could be with each other.
So here we are.  Waiting for the perfect time to meet.  I guess I told you this story because I wanted to give you a viewpoint from my perspective.  I wanted to show you how I felt.  Do you understand why I am doing this?  I’m lonely.  I’m depressed.  I haven’t been with a woman physically in over 5 years.  I haven’t kissed a girl in over a year.  I’m unemployed.  I have no confidence.  I have no life.  Here comes a woman that doesn’t care about any of that.  Am I just supposed to push her away?  Am I to destined to be sitting at home watching Netflix and masturbating for the next 5 years?  If that’s the way things are going to be, I’d rather kill myself.  It’s funny that I should bring that up, because when I told her that, she told me that she would miss me.  Yes she’s desperate and lonely and hopelessly broken just like me.  This of course is why we connect so strongly.

**SKIP THE STORY**


And now for the feelings and questions I’ve been desperately trying to avoid.  I would say at this point I’ve developed an unhealthy, irrational obsession.  We were supposed to get together yesterday when something overdramatic happened where plans had fallen through.  Her water pipe broke, then she got evicted from her house.  She was dealing with the drama of it all and felt this just wasn’t the right time to connect.  Now you might be saying to yourself, no big deal, we’ll just go out next week right?  Well, not in my mind because this always happens to me.  Maybe you misunderstood me.  It doesn’t happen to me sometimes, it happens to me ALL THE TIME.  Every time I make plans with a girl, something dramatic always happens where I don’t get to go out.  Here’s a list of some of the things that have happened:  Her father suddenly got ill and is now in the hospital, her mother had an emotional breakdown and forbade her to go, she got arrested and is now in jail…the list goes on.  Maybe some of those were lies, maybe they weren't.


So what happens to me when a girl cancels on me like this?  It triggers a severe irrational fear of abandonment.  I become obsessed about it and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.  It will burn me and run me to the ground.  But hey, maybe in this case its good right?  I mean it could be such a huge turn off that she’d cut our relationship completely.  Then I won’t have to deal with questions like, “After we get together then what?  Are we just going to keep seeing each other once every month?  Am I going to tear her family apart?  What if her husband finds out?  Am I gonna get my ass kicked?  Would she even leave her husband for me?  Would she even want to?  Would I want her to? But then what?  If she does, she has 2 daughters.  I don’t want kids.  She also has 12 dogs!  I can’t take care of a woman with 2 kids and 12 dogs.  I’m so fucked up, I can’t even take care of myself!  These aren’t even questions anymore!  They’re just the mad ramblings of an insecure lunatic!


As you can see, my mind is spinning wildly over this whole situation.  I feel like I can’t stop now because I’ve already promised her something.  I don’t know, she hasn’t texted me in several hours which means she’s probably mad at me or has already found my obsession a huge turn off.  The longer I wait the more obsessive I get.  If you are reading this I applaud you for getting this far.  You have just experienced someone’s mood go to mild to manic as I sit here and write this.
So what am I hoping to get out of this?  Why am I sharing these details with you?  I don’t know. One of two things I guess.  To get some sympathy related to how I’m feeling.  Maybe you’ve been there before.  Or, to confirm that my thinking is irrational and I should get rid of this woman immediately.  I’m not blind.  I can see all of it.  I can see how this can end in a complete disaster.  I can see my feelings getting crushed.  I can picture myself with my head smashed against the cracked sidewalk, or blown to bits with my father’s shotgun.  I can step outside my body and see myself with dead eyes laying  in a pool of red. None of it is enough to stop me from doing what I am about to do.  Because in this moment in my life, this insignificant part of history on this tiny planet in the vast reaches of space, on this useless rock that has no meaning when you consider time as a whole, that purpose is nothing but an imagined role we give to ourselves, when you see this spec of dust through a tiny microscope and you say to yourself, for once in your miserable existence, “I FEEL.”  I feel something other than just pain.   If you can see that, then you can understand why I’m about to do, what it is that I’m going to do.  There is something more to life.   I suppose you can call it hope, if only it lasts for one second.

1014,4o8wod,I may be bipolar and want medicate with mushrooms,"Hello Reddit! It's been a while since i've made a post, it is good to be back...soooo, here it comes: 

I have been having a very roller-coaster-ish life so far (im 25), and i am thinking that I suffer from bipolar disorder 2. I have been depressed earlier due to combination of marijuana abuse where I would smoke daily even though I rarely enjoyed the herb. I smokes for the habit. I do not believe the herb itself triggered the illness but was more of a facilitator and my mood and life in general were the reel root of ""poison"". I quitted smoking weed and hit rock bottom. Before I tended to explain my bad mood was caused by smoking but then I quit and realized that I did not get better. In fact i got worse. Now i was not ""numbed"" by the herb, every evening and felt bad 24/7. 

I took a pause from school, had a wonderful year and accomplished amazing things I never thought i could do, socialized, got popular and respected, got a girlfriend and so on. Things were rolling my way. Almost. In the period i felt relapses. I slowly got better and better, but now 2 years after, i feel that the progress has stopped. I have 3-4 weeks of joy, belief in myself - times where I just enjoy my stay here on earth. Then this period is followed by 3-4 weeks of mental pain, emptiness, low or none self esteem. Sounds like bipolar, right? I have not been diagnosed but i can really relate to the symptoms. I dont become manic as in I do crazy weird stuff, i am just happy and very positive which is related to Bipolar disorder 2. Anyway, i have done some googleling about bipolar and shrooms, and peoples opinions are quite mixed - some say that they can turn their bad (""badpolar"" ;-)) periods to got with mushrooms.

I have done LSD once which i found absolutely amazing and shrooms 3-4 times. First time was fantastic and the 2-3 last were mixed (they were low dozed i think) with no extreme fear but not sheer joy. Ive done MDMA once, also amazing but with a light downer the day after. 

I know the brain is complicated and mental troubles comes in great variety and is highly individual, but redditors do you have any advices for me? Any experience with this? 

I would really appreciate any takes on this. 
Thank you :-)

I have incredible mood swings. One day I envision my future and all the things I'm going to do and the other I stare blankly into the ceiling punching myself in the thighs and thinking about hanging myself. I attempted suicide twice but always cried before I were about to do it and stepped back. I left school because I wasn't able to literally function there. I had such massive depressions that I was always trapped in my mind. I had episodes (usually like a week or two) when I locked myself in the room and wouldn't contact anyone and people were worried about me. I work now and there are days where I am incredibly productive and do massive chunks of work in a matter of hours. Then there are days I barely leave bed (I work from home) and easy work I would do in a matter of hours I do untill midnight and more. Trying to distract myself by music/movies/games to forget how miserable I feel. I have social problems too. There are days I get super excited to spent time with someone but when it actually comes to that I get very anxious and usually cancel my arrangments. The funny thing is I 100% realize when I have a depressive episode. I know that in the morning it will be at least somewhat better but even with that knowledge I still think about suicide and my worhtless life etc...

1026,b26t77,"""I HAVE Bipolar Disorder"" vs ""I'm Bipolar""","From what I've observed most people with bipolar will say ""I'm bipolar"" when referring to it and ever since I returned to baseline it's irked me for a number of reasons.

I feel like its like saying ""I'm cancer"", or ""I'm AIDS"", or ""I'm schizophrenia"", or ""I'm bulimia"". Now, it's tricky because the word ""bipolar"" has a meaning outside of the medical world.

You can certainly have a bipolar personality (for example, laughing one minute and screaming the next because something pissed you off) but that is VERY different from mania and depression. I actually like the term manic-depressive because it provides an explination.

A big reason this I think this is a big deal is because saying ""I'm bipolar"" implies that you're sick all the time, when in reality, most of us are actually perfectly fine most of the time given proper treatment.

Also, especially in the early stages of recovery I've seen and heard of many that become consumed by their diagnosis and define themselves by it, which can really slow things down. Saying ""I'm bipolar"" is like having a tattoo covering your entire body, wheras saying ""I have bipolar disorder"" is like wearing a weighted vest that you understand will come off eventually - and may return, but will come off again.

Lastly, I feel saying ""I have bipolar disorder"" as opposed to ""I'm bipolar"" when disclosing your condition to people that are unaware or uneducated on mental illness or bipolar specifically is less fear-inducing and more question-provoking.

1043,59mp0y,"Stand for yourself, people. Remember that having a good doctor is everything, and having a bad one can get you killed. Know rational bipolar treatment principles. Know alternative (endocrine, immune, and so on) approaches to bipolar treatment","I see that there is a lot of doctor worship here, along with people on cocktails of many meds which frankly seem pretty insane. So I felt compelled to write this to remind you about importance of having a good doctor and proper treatment. That's literally difference between being disabled and high functioning for you guys, I'm looking at those who are given advise to change doctors immediately in comments. Don't wait for you having to get that advice.

There are lots of good doctors of course. But there are lots of bad doctors too. And some very, very bad doctors. To properly manage bipolar, to be able to have good quality of life, you need to learn how to distinguish between good and bad ones, and NOT listen to bad ones, they make things worse. 

**Having a good doctor is everything.** Please don't ever forget this mantra. 

Now let me write about some rational principles for bipolar treatment.

**1. Antidepressant usage for bipolar should be avoided if at all possible, they make illness worse, say psychiatrists specializing in bipolar disorder**

Check [here](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/#principle-c-beware-of-antidepressants) or [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mood-swings/201304/hating-bipolar-meds-the-illness-persists), both are articles by decent psychiatrists. First link is from a psychiatrist with 2 decades of experience who specializes in bipolar almost exclusively. Below are select quotes from those articles. 

1.

>**Unfortunately, most patients in the US and across the world receive the wrong medications: they get antidepressants, which are ineffective at best, and harmful at worst (causing more and more mood episodes over time)**. I've published and done research on this topic for two decades <...>. (I know many bipolar experts disagree with me on this issue, but I don't think the science supports their wishes to make antidepressants seem more effective than they are).  With these wrong medications, patients do worse. No wonder they hate medications; it is fully understandable.

2.

>**Antidepressants can cause “rapid cycling”.** Technically this means more than 4 mood episodes per year, of any type (depressed or manic or mixed), but cycles can be as often as every day or few days and a few people can go even faster, so-called “ultradian (more than one per day) cycling”. Rapid cycling is often harder to treat.

3.

>**Antidepressants can cause hypomanic or manic symptoms** (sometimes called switching”, meaning from depressed to manic). Overall, this is thought to occur between 20 and 40% of the time when a depressed patient with bipolar disorder is given an antidepressant. Though one review found much smaller percentages, the first study dedicated to looking for this rate came out with a switch rate of 20-30% in the first 10 weeks.

4.

>**Antidepressants can cause “mixed states“.** Remember, bipolar disorder is not like the north and south pole; hypo/manic symptoms can occur while depressed symptoms are also present. In a way, this is the same problem as #2 above, except that instead of switching from one state to another, you have both at the same time. Usually this looks like agitation or anxiety, or irritability; and difficulty sleeping; and depression, all at the same time.

**2. Antipsychotics (neuroleptics) should be used very sparingly if at all. If used, than only use neuroleptics for help with acute symptoms, and not for maintenance**

1.

Antipsychotics (neuroleptics) can cause [reduction in brain volume] (http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/07/03/antipsychotics-and-brain-damage-shrinkage-volume-loss/), it was confirmed on [primates](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v30/n9/full/1300710a.html) and [schizophrenics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3476840/) and should be common knowledge by now. 

2.

""Second generation"" antipsychotics (neuroleptics) do not merit this distinction [according to some experts](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(08\)61765-1/abstract). So although atypical antipsychotics (neuroleptics) are thought to be safer than typical, they still have severe side effects, including tardive dyskinesia (a serious movement disorder), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and increased risk of stroke, sudden cardiac death, blood clots, and diabetes. Significant weight gain may also occur. 

3.

Antipsychotics (neuroleptics) can cause [wreckage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21295450) to your [endocrine system](http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/703934) with often unknown consequences. Considering that there is a probable link between endocrine system (more on that later) and bipolar, this point is of utmost importance.

**3. Lithium isn't benign either, try to minimize its dosage to lowest effective (personally, I ditched it altogether, more on that later)**

Lithium can induce the [syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15714160) of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity. Lithium can lead to [health problems](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.132.5.529?journalCode=ajp) in children. There even are some [doubts](https://joannamoncrieff.com/2015/07/01/reasons-not-to-believe-in-lithium/) about lithium effectiveness among psychiatrists. Use with care.

**4. Beware of oppositional tolerance, it develops to almost all psychiatric meds and to all psychoactive substances**

Oppositional tolerance means that with time your brain compensates for a psychiatric medication (or any other psychoactive substance). This is because each medication/substance works by disrupting normal processes happening in the brain by altering signal strength via changed neurotransmitter levels. 

When you stop that medication (and sometimes even without stopping) you get opposite effects of what that medication initially provided. Simplified [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/58kex2/why_withdrawal_takes_months_for_some_people_or_on/) on this topic I made regarding weed, but just substitute weed with anything else, explanation will be as valid. 

Some people need much longer (or maybe even never will) to encounter oppositional tolerance. Others are not so lucky, so when medication stops working you are worse off than before you started.

**5. There are other approaches to treating bipolar disorder, completely different, but sometimes very effective**

1.

Modulating endocrine and immune systems seem promising. I'll expand only on endocrine, because that's what I have experience with. We know about links between [hypogonadism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972022) and depression, [hyper/hypothyroidism](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/thyroid-and-bipolar-disorder/) and bipolar, [estrogen](http://www.studd.co.uk/dep_women.php) and depression, and so on. Estrogen link seems especially interesting, turns out estrogen modulates lots of things no only in female, but in males bodies too.

2.

I now do hormonal replacement therapy for bipolar (over than three months now), and stopped all my meds. I know three months doesn't sound like a lot, but this approach lifted my depression without inducing mania, and it has some decent theory supporting it too. It's not perfect, but I know I'll keep trying in this area, and won't go to psychiatrist meds again. Side effects from this approach, compared to side effects from meds, are nonexistent.

To be able to do this I found an experienced endocrinologist, who was willing to try hormonal replacement approach for treating bipolar, despite all my blood tests being in normal range. I repeat, I do NOT have any pathology in endocrine system, and still use this approach. My endocrinologist is crazy in a good way - he is willing to try unorthodox approaches and does best he can to make it safe. God bless him.

Testosterone, estrogen and stress hormones are all somehow implicated, I have to monitor them. I'm replacing testosterone in particular, in addition with some thyroid hormones and even a bit of on-demand cortisol replacement, but my protocol is kinda crazy.   

There is a [paper](http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JBBS20120100005_46044311.pdf) which reviews existing hormonal replacement approaches. Another [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/attention-please/201310/hormone-imbalance-not-bipolar-disorder) on the same matter.

My very own personal opinion is that in majority of bipolar patients (not all but yes, the majority, though YMMV) the disorder root cause is not in the brain, and the poor thing should be left alone. We know about how much some disturbances in endocrine system can affect mood due to our studies on women, schizophrenics, and transsexual people. If I'm correct and this is indeed the case, it will also explain why psychiatrist meds are so ineffective for so many people on this sub. 

3.

I also looked into ketogenic diet, and on paper it's really, really promising. Extremely effective anticonvulsant, with all bipolar meds being that (including lithium, has anticonvulsant properties too). It's ""natural"" in a good way, meaning that we get major changes on cellular level, in mitochondria, etc., and for ""free""- we're invoking existing mechanism in the body, not trying to somehow externally change its state like with psychiatric meds. Our body likes homeostasis, and so invoking existing mechanisms is always better because our body will fight back otherwise. 

4.

And than there are approaches with modulating immune system, but I haven't done much research on this for now. I'll just say I learned that immune system disturbances can give full clinical picture of bipolar disorder. 

**P.S.**

Let me end with this. I was on meds for a long time. As you already know, meds and, maybe more importantly withdrawal, suck. But that's only the part of it. Another part?

Depression, hypomania, suicidality, self-harm, rapid cycling, all of that I experienced due to both meds, and more importantly, withdrawal. How do I know it's meds? Simple, I was never rapid-cycling, extremely suicidal of self-harming before, first year on meds I started self-harming. Why I'm sure it's meds not just my natural course of illness? Because I had problems keeping a job and tried to get help mainly due to this, but I always had those problems, they no worse that year when I met my first psychiatrist.

Now I tell you what: I see lots of doctor worship here. I don't like this. If you can't get a good doctor, you're probably be better off with no doctor at all, because having a bad one WILL harm you. Medication should also be used more sparingly. Being on cocktails of 4-5 powerful psychiatric drugs is not okay for almost anyone.

Why I'm so concerned about this and making this post? I have a personal motivation here people, three persons I know including myself were involuntarily hospitalized due to doing what bad doctors suggested them, so to speak ""listening to your (shitty) doctor"". 

It's your life, keep safe, question authority. No doctor will ever get how you FEEL on what they prescribe you. You gotta stand for yourself. Don't like how you feel? Change meds, change doctors, and remember that meds can cause depression, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and so on in themselves. If you doctors tells you your current meds can't do this, don't believe them, they are misinformed at best, and change them NOW. Remember, your doctor should get your informed consent by telling you everything about meds they are prescribing.

1047,3lyd94,It's a disease...and you're annoying me with that.,"Lately, I've noticed through social media, all sorts of 'awareness' type posts. You know, the ones that tell us not to tell a depressed person to snap out of it. That part doesn't annoy me, the responses do. The people who compare mood disorders to diabetes or broken legs. 

I just want to say, fuck off. My bipolar disorder isn't a broken leg. It's my brain. My brain. I can cope with the pain by changing my perception of that pain. I'm annoyed by this idea which disregards this fact. Medication only goes so far, perhaps only far enough to give me that motivation.

Yea, maybe my brain isn't regulating properly but to deny there is anything I can do, and to deny the psychological aspects is brushing away any hope I have on those days where the medication just isn't cutting it.

I'm not going to call in sick to work whenevere I feel like hell and my whole being hurts giving up saying, I have a disease and can't be like other people. Ive done that, it isnt good. It makes things worse. Sure, a mental health day here and there is fine but, make it a mental health day not a lie around feeling sorry for myself kind of day.

I feel like these sorts of posts imply that's what people with mood disorders are entitled to do, act like invalids. No @#% I have bills to pay and you know what else? I've gone out feeling like hell and found myself having an 'okay' day. 

Respond like that to one of these posts and you're told, you don't know depression though, that's you're insensitive to what it's like to be depressed. That depression is entirely hopeless. It isn't something that is even minutely in your control and you have to lie around like a sad invalid until your prozac, lithium, whatever starts working. 

I don't openly discuss my experiences with bipolar or the nasty, severe depressions I've been through with these types of people. I assume they'll think I'm being dramatic and write off what I've learned from it as some sort of ignorance to the disease.

No one blames themselves for their kid dying of cancer. People have so much compassion and sympathy for people with cancer.

""I was kinda of sad today... I needed to take a break...I needed to do some self-care and get a manicure. So important for mental health!!!"" Girl, STFU. You have no idea what it means to actually take care of mental health.

But do you think these same people want to talk about being committed to the mental hospital, being manic, self-harm, dangerous behavior, medication, addiction, obsessions, debilitating depression? Would you even trust them to talk about ACTUAL mental health? Of course they don't really want to hear about that.

They just want to talk about normal emotions and feeling feelings. That's not mental health. That's just the ups and downs of regular moods for neurotypical people.

EDIT: Thanks for downvoting my every comment. Thought people here would understand, but now I feel even more misunderstood. 

I'm not saying average people shouldn't talk about self care and (what they consider) mental health. Of course people should care about good habits, feelings, etc. 

I'm just saying talking about all this while pretending real mental illness doesn't exist, not acknowledging it, being intolerant or ignorant of it is hypocritical and hurtful.

1054,52qtw2,are ''bipolar'' famous people really bipolar,"**How many of the famous bipolar people do you think are actually bipolar?**
&nbsp;

I used to check regualry which people are bipolar since it gave me hope, but it started to feel fishy to me ever since I saw some websites that stated that people like Jim Carrey are bipolar, which is just ridicoulus. Provided that sources on wikipedia should be more creditible ,at least it says *""this is a list of people accompanied by verifiable source associating them with bipolar disorder.."" etc* , on the begining of the page.
&nbsp;

Im not saying all of them arent though. But some people kinda make me doubt if they actually have it
For example:&nbsp;
**Russell Brand**,**Mel Gibson**,**Lou Reed**,**Robin Williams** . Even **Stephen Fry** makes me doubt how he has been managing the most of his life without meds and being succesfull. I have watched his documentary, I am pretty sure he is properly diagnosed ,but still how come he has been able to cope so well,? And that is mostly without meds in his early life up until fairly recently. At least on the outside.
&nbsp;

And then again, there are people in the past supposedly bipolar, but how can we really know? People like **Marilyn Monroe**, **Frank Sinatra** . Even earlier, like **Edgar Allan Poe** and **Vincent van Gogh**. I know that Van Gogh died of suicide and had a pretty painfull experience. I even recall that his suppoused final words were pretty grim,but Poe has not been proved to have commted suicide. And even though he didnt have an easy life, how did he manage to cope without meds until the age of 40?
&nbsp;

I just have this sceptical feeling, and reading about most succesfull people with bipolar dosen't make me feel more comfortable anymore, because, as stupid and egocentric as it sounds, I feel like I have something different than them. Maybe I know too little about their life.  The bottom line is , do you think that many of those famous people with ""bipolar"" might not have bipolar afterall? Not necessarily people I listed above, just people considered bipolar in general.

Again, maybe they are sharing too little personal stuff, maybe my view of a person's life with bipolar are too grim, maybe they are just rich which may help, but still they all seem extremly successful to me and like they are leading a pretty good and productive life. By what I have been reading and by peoples attidute towards it, I really began to question myself if this is at all possible

1056,pgtfwy,Bipolar 1 and completely cured??,"Hey there ladies and gents, just though I’d share with you my experiences when it comes to this crippling mental illness. Very briefly, I had a serious manic episode exactly a year ago, subsequently sectioned and then discharged within 28 days. I’ve always been skeptical of conventional medication, so even when I was in hospital I used to slip the tablets under my tongue and flush them down the toilet. After being discharged I still didn’t take any medication,  I was considered at high risk ( mainly because the doctors though that I was taking medication in hospital and coming of it so quickly after been discharged would pose a high risk of relapse) off course they didn’t know I wasn’t even taking medication whilst in hospital. Against all medical advice I refused to take any Medication, I was being called and visited by the local mental health team almost daily for at least a few weeks after discharge. 

They all where essentially waiting for me to relapse, it’s been a year now and I’m fine, no depressive episode no manic episodes, my mood is very stable, things that would upset/depressive me in the past no longer have the same affect. I am far more confident, gained some healthy weight. In short I’ve never felt better in my life, I feel like the blinkers are really off, I don’t get nervous around people, hardly any anxiety whatsoever. Nothing at all like I felt before my diagnose.I don’t really now what this is down too, but I would like to mention the following.

1. MINDSET- I never believed even when I was in hospital that there was something “wrong” with me that needed fixing, I understand and accepted the diagnose but felt that because it is largely psychological, then my best bet is to deal with in my mind not rely on drugs. I decided this very early on. I told myself I’m bipolar, so what! , if I feel depressed I know that’s just the cortisol if Iam a bit excitable I know that’s just rush of serotonin. This Hormones don’t define me I define them ! I define myself ! I’ve always been someone who’s sure of himself outside of the depressive phases of bipolar so this wasn’t hard for me.
2. HIGH STRENGTH VITAMIN D- I’ve always had low vitamin D levels and read somewhere that vitamin D is more then just a vitamin but acts almost like a hormone. I swear by this, my bones no longer ache when I wake up, no weird clicks when I Bend my knees etc
3. COLD SHOWERS-my skin is no longer dry,high sex drive, Golden complexion, a sense of vitality etc ( look up the the health benefits of cold showers so many to go through) 
4. GYM— I really don’t need to go into detail about the effects of exercise of mental health, there are many studies out there already which I’m sure your all aware of.
5. PRAYER -  as a practicing muslim I pray at least 5 times a day sometimes more, this grounds me so much ! And I know ultimately that whatever obstacle god has sent my way I’m more then capable of overcoming it, because God doesn’t want to destroy or harm me god only wants to raise me.          I’m not saying don’t take medication of follow the steps I’ve taking, I know everyone’s path is different and different things work for different people, I’m just sharing what has worked for me. I don’t know why it has worked or if what I mentioned has worked completely, all I know is it’s worked for me for the time being.

1070,h8af2f,"You want it to stop? Well, you can’t, but you can manage it!","I’ve been experiencing bipolar issues for about two decades now.  It sucks. It sucks really bad.  However, I believe I’ve been able to manage it as successfully as humanly possible and I’d like to share with you how I’ve done it. 


First things first, and I cannot stress this enough: what you put into your body is the single most important way to manage our illness.  Food is our energy source, point blank.  A healthy vegan diet is unquestionably the best way to eat. You can debate it all you want, but if you eat nothing but veggies, fruit, whole grains, etc YOU WILL FEEL BETTER! 


Again, I will repeat: A VEGAN DIET IS ESSENTIAL FOR A HEALTHY MIND AND BODY!  You can argue and debate all you want, however you cannot refute the fact that if you eat a complete nutrition filled vegan diet, you cannot go wrong.  There is literally no downside to it. 


Secondly, abstain from all alcohol.  I’ll admit that I have a glass of wine a night or two a week. And I feel awful the next morning. I no longer drink beer or vodka anymore and I’ve noticed a world of difference.  You choose what you put into your body, if you’re bipolar and you drink moderately to heavily, it’s no longer on your brain chemicals and it’s now on you for the reason why you feel shitty.  So STOP DRINKING ALCOHOL!


Thirdly, get outside and be active somehow.  If you’re not athletic, just go for long walks. Be with your thoughts and accept them.  Use the time to think of different ideas on how you want to spend your life. You may come up with a brilliant idea!


Lastly, in regards to romantic relationships, there are two ways to go about it. If you’re wanting a short term one, just go with it and safely fuck your brains out with whomever you’d like just as long as you make it known that you’re not going to get serious.  If you are looking for a long term relationship, you must tell your partner about your illness, how it affects you, and you must let them know what you need from them when an episode comes up.  Open and honest communication is essential.  If they’re not willing to help you when you’re low, then they’re not a long term fit for you.  In addition to this, you must also return the favor to them if they ever have issues too. So many times I see posts on here about selfish needs and how their partners aren’t helping, but it’s most likely because it’s only a one way street. 


To conclude on how to successfully manage being bipolar:


1 - A healthy vegan diet
2 - No alcohol or hard drugs 
3 - Be active outside
4 - Honest Communication with romantic partners.",0,0

They said it was triggered by trauma. I had to split from my now ex-husband due to a crime he committed to keep our children, then 1 & 4. They are drug exposed newborns adopted through foster care. I am now the only parent. 

I had stopped working full-time in 2012 when my oldest daughter was born to be home with her. I needed to go back to work when I became single but found it hard. I have, after several failed attempts, finally returned to working in my actual career field as a teacher this school year full time. 

I broke up with my mentally and verbally abusive boyfriend as well in Sept. Yay me...my parents encouraged me, saying they would come, FINALLY, fill in where all the men (ex-husband, boyfriend who died, abusive boyfriend) had been. They haven't. 

Now to today...I have no help. My kids and I don't wash or shower, brush our teeth, etc, for weeks...two or more. The house looks like a hoarder lives here with 5 months of melaleuca, Amazon, and walmart boxes in the doorway, unopened. The counters and tables are covered in clutter. The bedsheets haven't been washed in 3 months. Sometimes the dishes, mostly cups, go a week. My kids eat dry cereal or take out for dinner.

1076,z2vrox,Was all of this legal?,"In June of 2021 I was placed in a psychiatric ward for 11 nights and 12 days. I didn’t feel things were being ran right and I thought rules were being broken by the people running it and I said so to my primary doctor. Then he told me he would pull some strings to get me out and started to act all nervous. It was my first time being placed in a hospital and I really want to know if I’m just traumatized and paranoid or if illegal things were really happening. 

In the ER I had a female security guard. I told her that my worst fear was being placed in a psych ward and she was trying her best to help me out. She took me to the bathroom so I could pee and told me not to say much because people were listening outside the door. She also told me not to eat any of the food they gave me and she threw it away. Can they put anything in your food? 

After I was transferred to the new hospital I was strip searched by a female and I was allowed to keep my underwear on. But when I walked through the main doors of the ward I immediately had a massive panic attack. This was my worst fear. I forgot my name and I lost the ability to speak. Then they started talking to me like I was a baby and they told me to walk into this small room. I did so and there was another door in there. They told me that I needed to go in and that there was someone waiting for me in there. Even in my state I knew I didn’t want to do that and I walked out of the room and down the hall. Things get really fuzzy after that but I never went in that room. I found out there was a shower in that room. I don’t know what they were trying to do. They already searched me. 

Another instance is them telling me that if I didn’t sign the voluntary papers that they would go to court and I would be there for weeks. 

And I had asked them to lock my parents out of my records because my doctor was talking to them instead of me and I was 18 at the time. But they didn’t listen. 

I also suffered for days on a very bad reaction to lithium that made me have horrible tremors, slurred speech, and eventually got me high. They took their time helping me. 

I wasn’t listened to. I was nothing. My treatment wasn’t private like I asked. Like I said, my parents talked to the doctors behind my back. Even once I told the doctors to take them off my release form. My doctors told them anything they wanted to know. Even after I was out of the hospital. 


I honestly don’t even know why I’m still typing about this place. It’s just been a rough day and I can’t stop thinking about all of it. There were a few more things that were just sucky but I don’t think they were illegal. Like liquid leaking out of my wall and having to waive my bill of rights in a nurses face to get him to let me have a private room because I was worried my roommate would hurt me. And there was man that managed to get into my room and leave a note by the end of my bed with his number on it. I just feel sick and I’m really struggling with my PTSD. I just need to not feel crazy about being angry at all of this. People I get no validation from my family that put me in there.",0,0

1083,tm3hy4,Maybe Bipolar?,"Hello folks (non-english speaker here). 37 years

I doubt that I am bipolar, even though I've heard this from a couple of doctors in the past years. First time I got drunk I was 12 and went full blackout, have been abusing alcohol ever since. Lost my parents before I was 20 and started doing tons of cocaine, did a fair amount of ecstasy and LSD to try to get out of cocaine. One one of those times, around 23 years old I had an ""episode"". Drank a semi lethal amount of tequila/vodka/whatever and had LSD. I end up punching a guys for no reason, walked alone in the streets (of brazil, quite dangerous) during the whole night, woke up next morning without shirt, shoes, all hurt. Ok, this was my episode.

I've been doing therapy on and off ever since, I am not 37 years old, great career, two kids, but struggle with alcohol. Haven't used drugs for a while, but the alcohol kicks my butt.

I am being honest saying that I would love to be certain that my diagnostic is correct, I have tried an large combination of medication (Lithium, Topiramate, Abilify, Vraylar, etc). None of them seems to work because my main symptom is the RAGE, ANGER and RESENTMENT. I honestly don't think I have experienced mania, maybe hypomania by reading you guys talking about it. I was depressed, but it's understandable how my life was on that given moment.

All I can say, I haven't been truly happy for YEARS now, I no longer feel joy in singing a song for example, I live in a ""gray"" state. But this anger and rage that comes up is nearly impossible to hold, and sometimes I end up being mean to my kids and wife, and most of the time, it takes less than a second for the guilty to come and then I feel like shit.

Again, I am not trying to deny that I have a disorder, I just think it might not be it. All the recent doctors I went took my initial diagnose and went with it, it's been at least 10 years I've been trying medications with no success.

Am I alone? Does anyone feels like this?

1086,rfk1dj,How can I get my friend to stop saying I'm bipolar?,"I went to a shrink the other day and I thought I was going to address bipolar.  It turns out, I just talked about my worries of what I'm going to do with the rest of my life since I'm retiring early and don't have to go into a workplace anymore.  Obviously when it comes to face-to-face meetings, I can't honestly bring up bipolar as a real concern, because it isn't.  I'm not going to have any more ""episodes"" if that's what they were.

There is one candidate episode that I take seriously, and that is when I went to a foreign country for 6 weeks and racked up a bunch of credit card debt and seemed to be hypersexual (though with 1 chick constantly), had psychomotor agitation, and was furious at the girl often.  I got chased through a mall by somebody who thought I was cheating with his gf, and nearly beaten up, made a big scene in the mall, had to see security.  I was almost held ransom in a drug-infested slum where that girl lived.  It just goes on and on.  I admit the whole trip was ""nuts"" but I don't know about manic.  I mean, I kind of laugh to think, ""Gees, how would that trip have been different if you were manic?"" and the answer is just, I dunno, I would have talked a little faster, I guess, that's about it?  Because all the other check boxes are there, just about.

On a throwaway cuz my friend is a fellow redditor. My friend Sam has recently be diagnosed as bipolar, and had two pretty severe episodes that sent him to the hospital twice within a month of each other. After coming home the second time, he has been on his meds and is talking normally (just not in speed demon mode like he is if he is manic). BUUUUUT

He is trying to do a lot of life changes at once, and I am just afraid he is going to spiral again, and I want to help him. He just wants to help people thru their issues, but he ends up taking them on as his own to solve. He recently referred to the several people he is dating and/or helping as ""stray dogs"" and said he is helping them find forever homes. So he knows these people have issues but thinks he can ""fix them"". I think it's going to end in financial ruin and heartache. I would never tell him he can't date someone because I don't like them, but I do want to tell him that he is in massive debt from his last episode, so he needs to quit giving the strays money!!!! He bought some furniture for a someone I don't really care for, and he has been out of a job for the last month. He quit his old job with a new one lined up, but ended up in the hospital so it delayed starting because of training schedules. He didn't even tell the person he wasn't making money at the time of buying! I listened to a lot of his side of the convo's with this person, and he treats her like he is her parent. She is super clingy and needy and a drunk. He told  that she ""doesn't drink that much anymore"", which is a problem. She has a drinking problem - she shouldn't be drinking at all. Also, her daughter and the daughter's friends recognize this girl is bad news, and told me everything they had witnessed. The daughter HATES her. I talked to his (my friend's)  mom and found out he is lying to her and his stepdad (who are just trying to help him too) about things, and his daughter tells me about things that he isn't telling me either. He is in a spending mode right now and is acting like it is no big deal. He keeps laughing off that his credit card is  almost maxed out. He is borrowing money from his family too, and I didn't know. So I am watching him buy things and don't know what to do. He bought a new RV late last year (it is financed) and is now trying to get loans to get a truck to tow it and to get a house. I don't think they will give him these anyway, but I just don't want him to spiral when he gets denied. And he is talking to some other girl - not romantically - and is convinced she is a genius and wants to open a business with her. He's also joining a band (which this I actually support - he is realistic about this that it is just a fun hobby and I think he is a good singer and that this could be an emotional outlet for him).  

I want to talk to him about my concerns (especially since I offered money to him to pay things off that he racked up on the credit card - but now have second thoughts because I want the money to be spent on him - no one else), but I don't want him to stop telling me things or see me as ""the enemy"". We have been friends for 16+ years. I also don't want to make him think that I am abandoning him or giving up on him in any way.  Please give me some advice on approaching my concerns without offending him or upsetting him to the point where he won't tell me things. I love him, and only want him to live his best life. I think he is just very lonely (we live in separate cities and he can't leave until the kid is done with school), and wants something like I have. I have been in a relationship for almost the same amount of time we have been friends. He has gone thru several long term relationships in that time, and I think he feels like he has to settle for these people because he won't find anything otherwise.",0,0

Power is of two kinds.  One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other is by acts of love.  Power based on love is effective and permanent. Power derived by fears of punishment is the space where evil develops.  It is the only way it can be created just like cancer can only be created in an unheatlhy body.  The pursuit of neglecting conscioussness is our downfall

When we receive the channel tuned with the creator of light .. we become co-creators with a will to bestow.  

When I am in this state.. everything is perfect :D

I am so in tune with frequency.

1110,fmsnhe,Need help understanding my neighbor with bipolar disorder,"Hey all,

I’m not sure if this community is just for people who have bipolar disorder or for anyone curious about it. I have a neighbor who I just found out a few months ago is bipolar. She’s very insecure about me talking to her boyfriend when there was no harm done and he and I were friends when they were broken up and I’m married. They got back together and now there’s major tension so I messaged him to make peace with it all and wish them well because we were friends and it sucks that I lost a friend because he got back with her but I get it. Well she found out I messaged him but doesn’t know what I wrote because her bf deleted the messages and I’m not trying to hide it because I didn’t say anything bad. Well she told my husband about the messages and for some reason invented stories that I wanted to take him to the hotel spa and get massages together? And try to meet up while my husband wasn’t around. Those things never freaken happened nor were even talked about!!! He asked me what the massages were like when I went to the spa but I never said “hey let’s go together!” Because 1. I’m married and that would be awkward af and 2. There would be no way of that happening because I have a child who I watch 24/7 because we don’t have anyone here to watch her so it would be physically impossible and my husband even told her that would be impossible because of our daughter. My question is, does that seem like common bipolar behavior? Inventing stories like that? My husband didn’t take what she said seriously because he knows she has a mental disorder but for some reason it bothers the fuck out of me. I want to clear the air with her but my husband keeps saying to let it go so I can’t message her or talk to her at all. Help please and I hope I didn’t offend anyone here.",0,0
1111,fcir69,Let's discuss the keto diet as a way to improve symptoms!,"Almost ten years ago I became really freaked out that I was going to get diabetes, so I got really strict into the ketogenic way of life. It helped me with migraines as well as improving my mood.

1113,doanm1,Mania and Spiritual Awakenings Part II: The Kanye Edition,"This post isn't meant to review the album that he just put out.  He just happens to be a very public example of this particular topic.  The purpose of this is to dive back into the concept of mania creating religious and spiritual awakenings or experiences inside of people with bipolar disorder.

About a year ago I created a post detailing some of my own experiences regarding mania and spirituality wondering if this was a larger theme of mania for others.  There were a lot of great responses that on a limited basis confirmed what I was thinking. The post can be found here for anyone that wants to check it out.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7u65en/mania\_and\_spiritual\_awakenings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7u65en/mania_and_spiritual_awakenings/) 

I want to pre-face this by saying that I've been a Kayne fan for a long time.  I don't always agree with what he says outside of his music, but I digress.  Anyone that's listened to his music for a while would know that to varying degrees all of his albums have carried some sort of religious undertone.

Given Kanye as the example:  

* Has a public breakdown in 2016.  
* Releases Ye, an album that generally details experience with bipolar
* Releases Kids See Ghosts with Cudi, a somewhat psychedellic hip hop album largely talking about mental health
* Releases Jesus is King, a predominately gospel album about, well, Jesus

Just interesting to see, whether you like his music or not.  The question is is he currently riding a manic high and the newfound religious Kayne disappears when the inevitable crash occurs?

Once again, I want to make it very clear I don't wish any harm upon him, I don't want to see him crash and burn, and I honestly just hope he's happy and healthy.  I don't believe there's anything wrong with him loving Jesus and there's plenty of evidence throughout his career that this is actually how he felt the whole time.  The only thing I worry about is him eventually hitting the point of no return in mania that many of us have.

1132,ai6oqy,Bipollar SO-Kids and an episode,"Ok, so my SO whom I'm working on divorcing (for lots of reasons at this point) diagnosed with BP2, and probably a bunch of other things. At this point my perspective is that she shouldn't stay in the house, for the past 6 months or so it's been ""okay"". When she's okay (she's a partially functional adult), sits in a corner and sews and helps here and there with the kids and laundry. When she isn't she takes over the living room and basically lives in there instead of her own area. There's been times where she is confused every week, and I really wonder if she'll ever be able to work/function on her own fully.  

Kelly has not been sleeping right for days ie maybe 1-2 hours if any(which happens alot)? Or eating right, I do know that Friday morning she had said she hadn't slept at all Thursday to Friday (1/18/2019).

I had talked about going to my parents with the kids but as there is an expected very bad snow storm I decided to stay home, safer.  Kelly was going to go to her parents, but because it had gotten dark she was going to go Saturday morning. In any case I put some pizza on for Daughter1 and myself, and started getting food together for the other two. I was sitting on the couch with Daughter1 playing a video game (death squared).

Any case Kelly was sitting on the chair off to the side, and started making comments we guessed about the game but it didn't seem to have any relevance. 

Then she proceeded to keep saying things where she was obviously getting confused.  At one point she said Son1 was in punishment, none of us knew what she was talking about. She said something had happened on the school bus.  There were a dozen other things she said where it was as if conversations/context, we were not involved in.  Both Daughter1 and I were sitting on the couch, for awhile Kelly was silent. 

Kelly then started to talk some more completely unrelated things, completely random it seemed. Everything from thinking I was taking the kids somewhere, thinking we were looking for things. She got up and started to talk to all three kids. And they looked at me, as whatever it was she had said (it may be in the audio recording) made no sense. 

I started the audio recorder on my cell phone as I wasn't sure what was going to be said, or not.

I told Kelly several times that she should go lie down, as she was saying she was tired. She responded that, that was a good idea. Then said she was hungry, I said I would bring something down to her. She didn't go down. She kept saying random things, and then went through several rooms thinking we were looking for things, or had asked or told her stuff. When we hadn't said anything to her. 

I was started to get worried as now she wouldn't listen to me to go lay down, or at least sit on the couch. I asked her to talk to her mom using the house phone, whom I'd called. And told them that Kelly was acting weird and really needed to talk to her. I gave her the phone within a few minutes, they called my cell and said they were on their way over to pick her up. 

I had no control of the situation,  I repeatedly asked her to stay downstairs she'd say okay. Then within the time it took to turn around again and come back up not even getting a step or two.  

She kept trying to interact with the kids, which I'm sure freaked me and them out a bit, I got them to go play on their tablets, Daughter2 was in the Kitchen and Son1 had gone into the play room. Daughter1 had gone upstairs and the pizza was ready, she didn't want to come down till Kelly was getting ready to leave. And I had a short conversation with Daughter1 about the situation letting her know that Mary and Al were coming to get her mom. 

I kept having to keep Kelly from interacting the children and she kept getting up and walking around acting as if we had, started a conversation and were trying to find/get something.

About five minutes before her parents showed up she had gone down to her area, and I was by the stairs. She called for me, and I went down the steps and she said there was a man by the laundry room, and another person or two down there. And they were scaring her, and that I needed to get them out of her room.  I got her to go back up stairs and her parents were at the house within a few minutes. 

&#x200B;

Any case they took her to their place, not the hospital like I recommended. They say that it's because she hasn't slept right etc. doesn't/can't eat right (as she gets sick from a lot of foods randomly). She may have messed up the meds as well.

Any case she'll be showing up here at the house again. I've already talked to her and mentioned a whole bunch of concerns etc.. Her response was that everyone has bad days, things can happen to anyone. And to a large extent minimized all of my concerns and lets just say this isn't the first time this stuff has happened. I even asked her how many times is this acceptable to have happen around the kids? (My answer is 0 times) ",0,0
1133,a6k7kt,Am I bipolar?,"Hello. I would like some help of you guys because right now, after a complete year after a huge psychotic breakdown I had due to taking cortisone I cant tell if im bipolar or not. In this breakdown I didnt feel grandiose at all, but my thoughts raced faster than ever and I was extremely agitated. I started yelling so much that I eventually ended in the psychiatric ward. They diagnosed it as a manic episode. What I think right now, after that is that I feel like im in a constant hypomaniac state for more than a year, is- is that posible?

  
In the past I had always felt a deep disabling depression and hopelessness but now, after rewiring my own thoughts through repetition and convincing myself I have somehow accepted my depression... I have become so numb I dont feel troubled anymore. I must say im still a total outsider and in the past I have attempted suicide three times by drinking bleach, swimming deep in the ocean and by jumping off a fifth floor. I have also experienced violent episodes, but they were fueled by my empty feelings of not taking the reins on my own life. But all these troubling events were five years ago.

  
After all this I have passed through various shrinks and they always insisted that every case is different so they never told me my full diagnosis. They told me I had a mix of depression and social anxiety, so they all prescribed me with a heavy dose of antidepressants. I told my current psychiatrist I thought I was bipolar, he somehow agreed and took my medication off one by one and prescribed me only valproate. 

  
The deal is, right now, I feel good. In the past I have dealt with a lot of anxiety and Ive been so heavily medicated for some years, that I dont remember nothing at all from that time. After all of the struggling and all of the medication, right now I feel calm, and feel somehow positive despite my negative circunstances. If I feel slight stress I have learned how to cope with it, control myself and diminish it. I even dont feel tired at all and I sleep good. Since I was a kid I have always been irritable but not until very recently I have somehow learned to nullify negative thoughts through meditation. I remember I had a lot of anger inside of myself and extremely visceral and disturbing nightmares, but they have totally disappeared.

1140,8sbevi,"[27 M] with my possible BPD girlfriend[25 F] of 1 and a half year is making me feel physically, mentally, and emotionally drained","Hello Everyone,

I am currently heart broken and feel so defeated. This past week was  one huge roller coaster ride. Just witnessing a cycle of anger,  happiness, and depression within a short span is so frightening to me.  This morning, I spent the whole commute to my work with tears flowing  down my eyes just to realize I definitely can not focus on my work  today. So I drove back home sobbing. Here I am, on this Reddit post  seeking for advice and help.

Last night, my girlfriend Katy came over to work out with me at home.  During the workout, I told her that I will be busy in the upcoming  weekends as I will have to go Seattle for work. She tried to chime in  saying ""I will go to Seattle?"" implying that she wants to come to work  with me. I told her that it won't be practical as I will be focusing on  work, plus the company is paying for me. She then repeated saying ""I  will go to Seattle?"" I brushed it off laughing thinking that she is  joking. She then asks me ""Are you leaving me?"" I told her ""no"" and that  ""work is work"".

From there on, she continues working out silently while her face  shows frustration and anger. I tried to ask her what is going on, and  then she just ignores me and continues pumping the dumbbell. Then out of  no where she states ""If I make a lot of money someday, I will leave  you"". I stayed silent which then she replied ""When are you going to give  me my $400 to pay for my bills?""

Now going backward one night prior on a Sunday. We were having fun  playing video games and just laughing/talking about random things. Once  the light turned out and we were laying in bed, she asked me in a  demanding way ""Can you give me your money"". I responded ""I'm not made of  money"". Then she stood up and started dressing and threatened me ""If  you don't give me your money , I am going to leave right now. Also, I  will slash your tire on the way out"". This is the exact moment, when I  was afraid of her. Although she is this tiny girl who does have a sweet  heart for me, hearing that just hurts. Not because I believe her, but  because if I had to stay with her for the rest of my life, I will have  to hear other nonsensical things that will hurt me. It makes me feel so  defeated because there is nothing that I can do to make it better. There  has been many instances where she get frustrated or mad at me for the  strangest reasons. I will try to get some sense in her my explaining  what is going on but she seems to not understand clearly. Eventually she  just says sorry and starts hugging me and giving me kisse. At times,  she also tries to just have sex with me. Just watching her do this makes  me feel sad because I feel hopeless.

Continuing from ""When are you going to give me my $400 to pay for my  bills?"", I responded, okay I will withdraw the money for you on  Wednesday. Then I straight out told her, ""I am tired and unhappy. I did  not want continue with this relationship anymore because I feel so weak  and I am sorry for that. I just can't handle it anymore, but I still  want to be your friend and get you help whether it be going to the  doctors or psychiatrist. ""

Her face just lit up with more anger and shouted more nonsense at me.  I wish I could remember exactly what she stated, but it didn't  contribute to what I wanted. She was just mentioning how she is doing  all the work in the relationship and that I am not trying hard enough. I  know or I just hope she doesn't mean this, but it just hurts me hearing  this from her.

Just so you know, she is my first girlfriend ever and when we were  dating. She knew that she would be my first. She was reluctant to go  into a relationship with me because of this, but I told her that it  seems unfair to label me this way which will ultimately lead to  self-fullfilling prophecy of failure. Well, she used this against me  last night saying that I scammed her. It felt like more needles were  pinching my heart because I did feel that way.

I eventually calm her down by stating that I wanted to help her and  take her to a doctor as a friend. I also said lets take some time and  think about if this relationship can continue, and she screamed ""No, I  don't want it to end"". It just pains me so much that I just reluctantly  said okay, but lets focus on what we need to do first which is to see  the doctors. She agreed to.

She went home late last night at 1:00am. I was able to sleep a bit  until I woke up around 4:30am. I was just lying awake thinking about the  possible future, whether I should continue to be her significant other.  I don't want to sound selfish, but I feel like I do have a choice in my  own happiness. I want to break up with her before even going to the  doctor because I don't want her to believe that I am leaving her because  of a diagnosis.

My mind and heart is just racing constantly at the moment, I am not  sure what I plan on doing is right. I already met most of her family  members and it just feels so bad to betray her this way. Currently I am  still contemplating if I should break up now or just continue to see if  things improve. It just makes it more tough when we have so many events  planned out, such as going to Coachella next year and going to Chicago  for vacation next week.

Katy is also in the period of her time where she has been job hopping  constantly because she is not sure what she wants to do for her career.  She has been unemployed for almost a year now. Prior to that, she  jumped around 3 to 4 different low paying dead end jobs. She has this  conflict where she wants to be rich because her father is wealthy just  to make him proud but she understands that is not the perfect way to  enjoy life. I think we share the same value of trust and honesty, but  seeing her this way just hurts me so much.

Although there is no diagnosis of her yet, I strongly believe she is  bi-polar base off of my speculations. Aside from the mood swings, there  are days where she gets few hours or no sleep at all and she feels  energetic. Then there are days where she sleeps for more than 12 hours  and feels tired. I hope I am not labeling her with bi-polar which will  also ultimately lead to a self-fullfilling prophecy of failure. Dealing  with this issue has brought so much tears to my eyes and makes me feel  so exhausted. I think about what future we can have together and I  simply don't see it anymore. We both imagined what our kids would look  like together, but it is so hard to picture it now if this issue  persists or gets worse. I wish I can do more, I wish I can be stronger.

There was even a thread on a forum full of people claiming, ""I cut out gluten and/or dairy and now I feel like a normal person."" Some even go as far to say that they were able to go off their meds.

1153,4nijtp,I think I'm being followed,"Hi guys. I'm typing this on my phone so sorry for any spelling or format mess ups. To cut to the chase I think something is following me or watching me or something I'm honestly not sure. This is going to be long and I apologize ahead of time for that, but I have no one else to talk to. 

I'm 21 years old and live in the Midwest. The first time something happened to me was in 2005 when I was 9 years old and my family took me to see Amityville Horror at the movie theater. The next morning I woke up and a couple strange symbols were carved into my stomach (no blood) with a nail or tip of a knife. I told my parents and they freaked out and accused me of doing it to try and get attention. The symbols -if I remember right- was like an X - 1 or in that idea. There was for sure an X. 

My mom freaked out so my dad made me tell her I was making it up. I wasn't. 

Ever since then nothing has been right. This thing that has attached to me makes everyone hate me. It tells everyone that nothing I do is right and makes my parents hate me. Sometime I wonder if they're even my real parents or not. I mean I look like them but they don't act like other people's parents. 

From what I've told other family and friends my parents of my experiences growing up, my parents have been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. I know that in my head but can't accept it in my heart. I would die happily for my parents if it meant they would show me some love. Do anything for them. 

Moving on. When I go into the bathroom at nighttime I always feel like someone is watching me from the corner. Like the upper corner where the wall meets the ceiling. I'm afraid of the dark because I know that there is something bad in it. When I turn my lights off to go to bed I sprint to my bed to let the entity know that I am afraid and to please not attack me. 

I've tried blessing the house with holy water but I still felt it. Now I've moved and while the new house doesn't have nearly the same feel as the other one did, it's slowly creeping back. 

My parents hate and are disgusted by me so I'm staying with relatives. They act like the care about me but I know deep down the only reason they're letting me stay there is because I'm blood to them. 

Sometimes I see things out of the corner of my eye. Shapes and shadows and occasionally the figure of a person. This happens at night and in the day time. 

My mom convinced me to see a psychiatrist a couple years ago and I was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 because of my mood swings and depression but I only took the medication for a little while because it didn't help me. When I go out I'm the life of the party but when I'm alone I feel like I'm being enveloped by a dark being. 

I have days where I think about killing myself but I have never made a real plan or tried. I cut my wrist up bad a couple months ago because I felt like I was numb and needed to feel something. 

I'm always worried that people don't actually want me at their party or sleepover and I really think that everyone talks about me behind my back but then pretends to my face. 

I was in college but my parents pressured me to drop out and help pay for things at home, but that didn't work out so now I'm no longer in school and staying with different relatives. I find myself getting angry about things that other people don't get angry about. 

Some things I like to do are read and watch movies. Being around people just exasperates me but when I am around them I'm the most charming, personable, generous, and funniest person in the room. 

My current job doesn't offer health insurance so I'm not able to see a psychiatrist unless it was really needed, then I'm sure my relatives would begrudgingly pay for it. But do I need a psychiatrist or a priest? Am I crazy or am I being consorted against?

Either way I need help and I've never seen a community that cares as much, answers as fast or as in detail as Reddit. If you have any questions at all for me I'll answer them. What do you think is going on with me??

I'm going to post this in a couple subreddits because I'm not entirely sure which is the right one. 

Thank you

1155,4if60e,I need your open-minded opinion.,"Hi. Before I go further, here's a disclaimer: I do not mean to denounce your experiences, stand against medication, or imply that my opinions superior. I just want to have an intelligent conversation about bipolar. 

My father was bipolar and abandoned the family years ago.

I've gone through bouts of depression in the past. I'm unable to cope well with loneliness (I.e. Living alone after having a roommate), tense relationships, and changes in schedule.. I'm extremely regimented. I have to exercise everyday or I feel irrationally tense. Whenever I consume sugar or refined grains in excess I feel a bit detached from reality-- like anything terrible or wonderful could happen at anytime. My diet originated as a body image problem, but I eventually realized how incredibly better you feel eating this way. 

My depressed periods are mostly filled with this terror that I'll never be anything or feel anything or care about anyone again.   

But what I've found is that, whenever I have exercise regimentation, strict diet, and an available  support system, I'm almost immune to the emotional highs and lows that have historically been so terrifying. I started researching bipolar last year, when my therapist said that onset could occur at anytime.. And these things confused me...

1) a hormonal imbalance 
Some websites say there is no test to measure hormonal imbalance, while some say it clearly in the definition.

2) differences in the brains of bipolar
Doesn't lack of utility in a particular part of the brain cause changes in the brain? So if one part of a bipolar person's brain is smaller or less active, how can they tell if environmental factors or a different mindset didn't cause this change overtime (instead of a genetic predisposition)? And how are medications an effective way to take advantage of the brain's plasticity? 

3) Why is there so little about diet and exercise on treatment websites? Most people know by now that ""comfort foods"" are desired because they basically make you temporarily high. And lack of activity/being overweight/eating like crap while having a fast metabolism is not going to be cured with psychotherapy. 

I've started reading books about alternative forms of medicine. I know many of you have probably had this natural vs. pharmaceutical debate already, and maybe you know more than I do about the topic, but I've yet to see a conversation about this that didn't end in an agree to disagree... 

I'm wondering if you've tried extremely strict dieting? Daily exercise? Supplements? Did it work?  I'm just trying to understand why drugs and psychotherapy are tried first instead of changing your body's composition. If food is the fuel that runs all of these mental processes... How could it not have an effect?",0,0
1156,4azy58,"Accused by SO of telling stupid lies (Just a long rant, sorry)","Last night we crawled into bed and my girlfriend began crying. I know she's been having a hard time with depression (BP1), so I rolled over, put my arms around her and asked if she wanted to talk. This is nothing unusual, and I can usually get her to chill out until her night meds kick in and she falls asleep.

So...She starts by telling me how much she hates nighttime since our neighbor passed away (he always sat on his porch smoking and kept an eye on everything), and how scared she was because the following day she had no work and no plans, basically stuck alone in her head all day.

Suddenly, she accuses me of lying about cleaning the dust from behind her desk, because she looked behind it and still saw some dust. Mind you, this wasn't something she asked me to do, I just did it because it was dirty and didn't want her to deal with it. I told her yes I cleaned it, perhaps I missed a spot. 

Ten minutes pass...""Did you really clean behind the desk, because it's still really dusty.""

I didn't appreciate the accusations, especially at bedtime. I got up, moved the desk, and cleaned the floor and wall underneath it again. There was a 1sq' area I must have missed the first time.

Now she's pissed at me for getting up to clean. I sat down on the couch for a minute to regain my composure. 

""What are you doing?"" she called from the bedroom.

""Just sitting.""

Well now she's even more pissed, because she thought I answered her in an angry tone. She stated that I lie to her all the time, so why wouldn't I lie about this stupid cleaning job.

Now I'm getting pissed, and I'm dealing with my own BP2 with anger issues. I decide to leave, and she begins yelling at me that of course I'm leaving when she needs me. 

I'm now staying at a hotel, and she keeps texting me apologies telling me she needs me to come home. This isn't the first time something like this has happened (lots of accusations of cheating in the past). 

In a nutshell, I'm done with it. I do my best to be a caring, loving partner. I've dealt with her 2 bouts of psychosis, her sleeping with someone else, and coming home to her misery night after night when I'm struggling to get myself through the work day. 

She owns her house, but I've been the sole means of support the last two years. I don't want to go home, I feel like I'll lose my mind. And frankly, I don't want to be around someone who doesn't trust me. I'm just trying to decide if it's time to call it quits, I know I'm happier alone, but the guilt of leaving when she's in a depression is too much.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm on the brink of despair, that there is nothing worthy of meaning and desire. I rarely see my friends and family members these days. I rarely partake in my hobbies anymore, such as poetry, writing, and reading. All my enthusiasm has withered down the drain; I feel like an invisible ghoul. I have faced so much social rejection from peers and it hurts. I do not want to get out of bed most days. I brain feels as if it is on autopilot most of the time; difficulty thinking, making connections, talking, and reading in general. Depression is physically and mentally paralyzing for me. For the past five days I have felt possibly hypomanic: extreme high sex-drive, insatiable appetite for pornography, wanting to sleep with many people (in my imagination), my skin feels like crawling, agitated, irritable, angry, restless, racing thoughts, creative with writing the other night, happy but not authentically; more to do with higher level of chemicals, negative thoughts as well. I do not feel highly talkative, a big spender, etc. but my creative thoughts may enhance more. My moods are so unpredictable, I'm not sure what to do, I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor soon about blood work; she thinks it may be a thyroid issue, but I think my depression is much more wounded and deeper than a thyroid issue, though I'm not medically certified myself.

1168,3ahjlu,So I took a bipolar online screening quiz...,"And the results indicate I show signs of having bipolar.

I also took similar quizzes for schizophrenia, anxiety, ADD, and depression, and I came up positive for possibily having them as well.

Anyway, I did take them with intentions of trying to figure myself and my issues out more. I have been ""diagnosed"" in the past with depression, anxiety, and ADD, and am currently on antidepressants under a psychiatrist's care. 

However, I struggle with racing thoughts. I'm a very high strung, nervous, anxious person, and went on Zoloft last week as it's interfering with my life tremendously. I'm also generally depressed. I started getting curious about bipolar as I noticed when I'm not on meds I will go from feeling low to doing stupid things like charging a $1000 laptop or change jobs on a whim.

My focus and thinking is very fuzzy, and I drift off in thought a lot, and I think that's where the ADD diagnosis came in. I'm convinced I don't have it though and don't take meds for that anymore. 

I question the manic thing, as I don't have mania like all the stories I've read that included bizarre delusions and such. I've never had a psychotic episode or lost touch with reality in that sense. I just feel very restless, like my thoughts won't stop.

How is it logical to call label someone with a mental ""disorder"" and then proceed to treat them to bring them back to ""normal"".  When ""normal"" is an arbitrary human construct that changes constantly.  It is the label ""disorder"" itself that causes us to be ostracized from society, not the symptoms alone.

1173,1zymts,"I believe my BF is having a manic episode, but he won't admit it. I'm becoming irritated.","Update: We talked. He told me he was coming down from a manic episode at the time. So I wasn't wrong on that. Not that that really matters. Anyway.. I told him I was sorry and I know what I did was wrong. We talked about why I get upset and we both know I need to get help. I won't get into the details of what's wrong with me, because I haven't really sorted it out myself. But I believe it has a lot to do with depression? He said he still wants to spend the rest of his life with me, and we're trying to help each other grow as partners. 


I don't know much about bipolar disorder, but I've been with my bf for 4.5 years. We're in a LDR and am very familiar with his typing and speaking habits. I FEEL like I've noticed different times where he quite possibly may be manic, but he will tell me he can't be because he's on his meds. What can I say to that? He probably knows more than I do.

This morning he texts me paragraphs after another about his family packing up (They're moving soon) and he's saying things in a way that he doesn't usually say thing. Like if he were speaking, it would sound like he's talking a mile a minute and not taking a breath and saying things like ""It's crazy. That is crazy. You're crazy"" And little tiny sentences like that. Normally he's a very introverted and almost apathetic sounding guy unless we are having a great time or talking about something he's passionate about. So this is highly unnormal, especially right off the bat. He then goes to tell me he's been off his meds and needs to get more and goes on about his bloodwork blah blah. And then tells me he's really pumped because he got a new visual novel and how it made him squeal just typing that out.  This is were I get really irritated. I try to be understanding and open, but I become jealous and in a bad mood because it feels like whenever he may be having a manic episode/is overly excited about something, it doesn't involve me. I know that sounds childish, but over the course of 4 and a half years, and going through many times where I don't feel like he cares about me because he doesn't show it very well all the time, it irritates me when he is very obviously excited about a new video game.. or a visual novel.. 

Also failed to mention that I pointed out he might be manic and he says ""I'm not ruling it out. I'm logical. I'm just not blaming it."" It seems very obvious to me. 

Since then he's said he obviously needs to hide his happiness from me unless my name is involved. And he can't imagine living with me, sharing his life with me like I say I want, if this bit of happiness causes this much of a problem. ""Something petty is making you happy? Fuck that."" And now he doesn't want to talk to me today.



Anyway. Opinions, advice? I know I'm not perfect. I'm trying. Really. ",0,0
1174,1tg4j7,I feel so betrayed. Doctors lied to me.,"So, ever since I can remember I've always wanted to be a police officer. But I found out that I'm probably going to be disqualified as an applicant because of previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder. THIS is why I didn't want to get help. I went through a really tough spot in my life as a teenager and very reluctantly got help. I really wanted to get help. And did. But this was one of my fears. The fear of being fucked over in a job because of a diagnosis. I haven't needed medication for some time, and haven't been to an appointment in the same amount of time. Because I haven't needed it, as soon as my life got better so did I. I'm even highly doubting the doctor's diagnosis. I haven't had a mood swing in an extremely long time. I asked the doctor time and time again ""Is this going to affect my chances of employment anywhere?"" and I was met with the same no each time. The level of betrayment I feel is through the Goddamned roof. I'm nervous, I haven't had a good nights sleep in about 2 weeks. My dream career seems unlikely. I went through 2 years of criminal justice to become an officer, but was met with this unfortunate revelation 2 weeks ago. All I want to do is help people, but can't because I thought I was doing the right thing and getting the help I needed. I suppose not. From now on I REFUSE to get help anymore for anything short of a doctors visit. From now on I will bottle everything in just like I should of to begin with.",0,0

I have denied it for some time but lately I have caught myself on the verge of having to do some minor chore and just skip it, because... idk. On the other hand, I know, that whenever I get exited about something, I can go all day doing it. Only the problems is, if I don't finish it by the end of the day, the next day I just might forget about it. For example: a few years back I have gathered my friends and we have build some pull-up bars near our living block. It took us a day. And it was great. But when It comes to actually working out on them I skip a day, then a week then I don't go at all. I get bored. Another example: I have always wanted a model aircraft carrier. I bought one and assembled half of it in a day. But when it came to finishing touches... it just stands on my desk. For a month now. Same goes for work. Wen I get a new project the first week is exiting. By the end of the month, I have no idea what to do and I feel like Facebook is the best way to spend my time.. I know that this might be because I'm lazy, but the spikes of excitement ... Am I bipolar?

I know I need to work on myself. I know I am a monster at times. I accept myself and try different methods to help myself.

I realize that. But if that had happened to me, I would be able to say, ""Oh my God, something is really, really, REALLY wrong."" The mania, if that's what it was, that preceded this nearly 2-year depression was just....ridiculous. I just went berserk on an online psychology forum. Overshared, flirted like a maniac, used too much profanity. And I smoked too many cigarettes during that time. That was it. That was IT. It was this hateful depression that ruined my life, not the mania. 

13 years ago, I had an episode with more dangerous behavior: promiscuity, drinking too much, driving drunk, spending money on stupid shit, etc. But that was 13 years ago! And, weirdly, there were never ANY consequences: no STDs, pregnancies, traffic tickets, etc, etc. Since then, I've struggled with depression off and on, but I've been functional. If I experienced mania, it just looked like being more social than usual and immersing myself in spirituality. I've had a very even keel life for more than a decade!

What I mean by that is that the connection we have with the elements and all things during a psychosis might be real. After all, what is reality? It is very subjective and reality may not necessarily be what we see in our every day life. 

But unfortunately there is a prize to pay for seeing what is behind the curtain, by penetrating God's realm and see the universe not as we are supposed to see it but as an entity such as god would see it.

1195,3m95c9,"So I've always been on the fence about it. But now I'm back to believing bipolar does not exist.[Rant, discussion opener]","Basically I'm sure we've all struggled with the diagnosis of bipolar at some point. And I have gone back and forth on this a million times. So I'm not going to speak in any absolute terms, but here is where I am currently at. My diagnosis was the result of a full blown manic epode. No question about that. I literally believed that I was Jesus for a month and the whole 9 yards. Was completely euphoric 24/7. No longer required sleep, all that stuff. But what happened was I was under an unmanageable amount of stress and in a horrible spot in life. And instead of going depressed, or dying from stress, my brain had to do something. So it flipped some kind of switch where I could no longer process things negatively. Well after a month of shenanigans I wound up in the ER. After throwing around 10 nurses and doctors like the beast throwing wolves around in beauty and the beast,  I was held down and given 2 shots of haldol, which brought me back down to earth. It's been about 3 years since then, and I've had plenty of time to try medications and assess the big picture. Personally I don't think Bipolar exists. And I think the diagnosis itself is in fact a very harmful mindfuck. It seems ridiculous that after one episode you would be burdened with this diagnosis for the rest of your life. Most people don't realize the power our own thoughts can have on ourselves. There used to be in psychology the term ""nervous breakdown"" for these types of meltdowns. I think that needs to be brought back. Over the last 3 years I have come a long way from the life situation I was in. During that time were horrible, horrible depressing lows. I tried a lot of meds to no avail. I often isolated myself to basically solitary confinement. I'm sure a lot of us do. But there I think lies the problem. It's been proven that just 24 hours in solitary confinement can do a lot of damage psychologically to a person. We are meant to be social creatures, pack animals if you will. So moving foreword to the past year, my life has improved so tremendously from where I was when I had my melt down. And the big picture seems so clear to me now. I feel great most of the time, my life is together. I have a wonderful girlfriend, tons of friends, I like my job, I have money, it's awesome. I'm truly happy, no denying that. And I did it all without meds. I absolutely didn't do it alone. God damn I was so suicidal and thank god I reached out to people for help. And slowly and surely I took care of all the problems in my life causing me grief. Another huge factor I believe is spirituality. Which was very fucking hard for me to figure out. But now I finally have a view on that that I feel comfortable with and it has helped me immensely. I truly believe this life is a spiritual deal, though I have no religion or anything, just kind of a mash up of them all. Anyways any feedback would be appreciated. And no I'm not manic, just been thinking about this a lot and getting it all out. Much love, and good luck. ",0,0

It is not even loose or free association, because in that, things are at least remotely related, what happens with me is that when I try to trace back through my thoughts I find absolutely no association at all, no bridge at all between two thoughts.   

I in particular got curious about this thing when I was put on antipsychotic for anger, I just observed that my thoughts got very clear and I became very articulate and verbal.  I also realized that it got very easy for me to focus while studying.  I could just simply sit and study without thinking all the BS that randomly popped up.  

I used to think I had a very minor form of adhd for many years, way too minor to get a diagnosis because of my inability to focus, but I feel it might be this thought disorder. And it is because the antipsychotic subsides it which is why I am able to study better.

1203,3buh00,Understanding Bipolar To Get Help,"Most individuals that suffer from bipolar have one goal. That goal is to live a life that is as normal as can be. To get through today without having any emotional problems, to make it through the big meeting at work without having people wonder what is wrong with you and to simply be able to enjoy your daughter’s graduation are all additional goals that you may have. 

Before you can fully learn to cope with bipolar, you need to fully understand your condition. You need to know what things happen, as best that you can, so that you can then trigger your coping mechanisms to work for you. 

There is no 100 percent sure way of stopping these things from happening to you. But, there are countless things you can learn to do to help you to improve your outlook.  

To get to that point, we will start by giving you all of the information you need about your condition so that you can better understand what is happening to you. If you are a family member who just wants to help someone that has bipolar, then by all means, you too can learn all that you need to in order to deliver the help that you can give to them.

Bipolar is a condition in which there are extremes in moods and life experiences. There is no doubt that bipolar is a health condition that is serious and disabling to those that have it. It is a mental illness and it does require necessary treatment. 

You may have heard bipolar called Manic Depression or that a person suffering from it has a manic depressive condition. But, what scientists have come to learn is that manic style behavior is only one extreme of this condition. The other part of it is that of depression. Both of these conditions are vitally serious to your well being and even to your life span and must be treated.

While doctors do not have a cause for bipolar, they are working on finding one. Along with that, you can be sure that there are many scientists looking for a way to cure the condition. Yet, until that happens, we need to examine what we do know about bipolar and what it does to the person that you are.

For most people bipolar starts when they are just in their teens. Some believe that it is triggered by puberty. Others  
will not develop this condition until they are in their early adult years. Bipolar can last your life time, too. 

For most individuals, bipolar is a condition that doesn’t happen all of the time. You don’t go in and out of moods ore other experiences within seconds and you don’t do this all of the time either. For example, some people will have bouts that last for several weeks. Others will have them for a few months at a time. Although it is possible to have bipolar in which your symptoms flare all of the time, this is really the rare case. 

If you don’t get help for bipolar, your condition is likely to continue to worsen. There is no doubt that depression itself is a killer. Therefore, not getting help is simply not an option. But, the good news is that there are medications, treatments and therapies that can help to reduce the symptoms and help you to cope with your condition.

1211,10n3qdz,Is it ok to not medicate?,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II late last year, after years of cycling through hypomania and depression. I was diagnosed because I noticed what was happening to me, I researched it, and asked a psychiatrist for help. However, also being autistic, I am quite sensitive to medications. I used to take SSRIs for depression and those only made me feel worse, for example. So I am very hesitant about taking medication for BPD.

All that being said, my main hesitation comes from the fact that I seem to be managing my symptoms without negative impacts on my life. I don’t make poor choices or do things I regret while hypomanic. My brain just feels electrified and everything seems interesting and fun. I’m aware many people take up new hobbies during this phase and then later drop them but I tend to either stick with the new things I pick up during hypomania or at the least, put a pause in it and return to it when next I feel able. Depression always comes back. 

But now I see that neither one lasts forever. I will feel the worst I’ve ever felt and I now tell myself “it’s ok, it’s because of the BPD”. And sure enough, I can ride the wave until it passes. And when mania returns, if I feel inclined to make a purchase or something, I can tell myself “it’s hypomania. Wait and think this through a bit.”

This approach, along with proper research, some new vitamins and supplements, and exercise, has helped me a lot with these cycles. So do I even need to bother with medication?",1,0

Every time I see a post on here with this misidentification it makes me roll my eyes. It’s a similar reaction to when people use the incorrect terms (ex: hypo/mania). I don’t know if people just don’t know or if people don’t care.

I know it doesn’t matter to many people. And I know this is a weird thing to have issues with. But it irritates me to no end.

I ran around naked, was tackled in the ward, talked to animals, thought I was God, and generally ruined my life...on multiple occasions. Yay meds! And yay for awareness truly. I and millions of others would never have progressed this far without taking things seriously and recognizing the severity and legitimacy of mental illness.

But the over expansion, imho, diagnoses human suffering in ANY mental form, as a disorder and not just life itself. As if life on its own, for any species, has been anything more than a gritty struggle for millennia.

Do you really think ""neurotypical"" people don't have issues? The more I learn about my own neuroses, the more ""normal"" people's become exceptionally obvious to the point where I can only relate to neurodivergent individuals because at least they are honest and have empathy. Neurotypicals just don't label themselves or get diagnosed formally. As if my psychiatrist is some holy arbiter of health with no issues simply because they studied psychology. Yea ok. Probably has NPD.

I’m convinced she is one of these because she for one seems soulless. She shows no emotion. She is so monotone and has no expression positive or negative that shows up on her face. I feel like I have always had a sixth sense and can really feel the vibe of people and I have always felt something so strange has been off with her I’ve never been able to connect on a humane level and have never been able to open up or trust her and she is not a personable person at all.

1227,q8g5ut,Toxic relationship with bipolar fd me up ..help,"I’m going to try and make this quick, but I guess my hope in writing this is that someone will be able to relate or confirm my belief. 

Freshmen year of hs I was super insecure, but I was happy and had friends. Not long into fm year I started crushing hard on a boy  in my class who was super into himself, SUPER good at swimming and super into girls. He had tons of girls in his phone always. Anyways I was innocent and “fell in love” w this boy. He pressured me into losing my v card and made me do other things I wasnt comfortable with which isn’t cool butat the time I though that’s what love was. Fast forward 6 months he breaks up w m and then desperately cried for me back. We get back and I find out he has sex with another girl (his sisters friend at a sleepover at his house). We break up, he has more sex, lies about it, and we get back together. He would creel me how depressed and suicidal he was and all these things he promised I keep to myself (one of the times he all allegedly cheated one I told his mom abt his suicidal ideas as I should have). He would say that if I don’t stay with him he’s going to kill himself and would drive like 100 mph when he was upset to scare me, he was diagnosed w bipolar sophomore year which made sense and later he was sent to rehab but These made me feel obligated to stay w him bc he was at a vulnerable time.. it was a VERY emotionally draining and toxic and this went on for 4 years.
Anyways I would always go back to him bc no matter how bad he f d up he would always say “if you really love me youd work through it with me”. And I needed up sheltering myself off to just him my senior year. 

We break up when we go off to college and I have my first manic episode at college, like close to a psychosis and I get diagnosed with bipolar 1. Looking back, I can only place my reasoning for my episode on this relationship. I have no childhood trauma and no family history of mental illness AT ALL. I am in an credibly loving and supportive family but I can’t seem to get over how this could have happened to me. If anyone reads this, could this be a logical reason ? I know bipolar isn’t contagious but I can pinpoint the time my mental stress began is when I started seeing him.",0,0

1231,ldx1ll,Reconnecting with nature and moving our bodies can help with our mental health issues!,"As humans, we were born to be wild.

We were born to move, to explore, to play, to be in nature.

It’s in our DNA.

If you think about it, our first home was the earth 🌍There was a point in time, long. long ago, when earth was all we had. Until we started building, no one was born with shelter- our first floor was the dirt and our ceiling the sky. Our decor the trees, the flowers, the ocean and the mountains. What a beautiful thing if you think about it 💭🌊🌸⛰

So it’s no wonder that being outside in nature brings us a feeling of peace and energy.

And it’s no wonder that sitting at a desk inside all day feels uncomfortable and exhausting.

And it’s probably why so many of us struggle with mental health issues.

Sadly it’s most likely why so many children are being diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and the like.

Did anyone ever think of this- maybe it’s the education system that’s damaged and dysfunctional and the children are just acting in the way they first designed to be? Wild and free- Desperate to move and run around, to be outside and play, yet confined inside to a desk for most of the day.

To me, it sounds like the education system needs some adjusting, not so much the kids.

We are not connected to nature anymore. We aren’t doing what our bodies were originally intended to do.

So we need to go back to that. We need to make it a priority to get up and move, get outside, explore and play! Think back to times you’ve ever done these things- how happy, alive and peaceful did they make you feel?

It’s the weekend. Get outside and go for a long walk in the woods. Go on a road trip, do something that makes you feel alive and free. Make it a priority to reconnect with nature I promise you- you will feel better after than you did before. It will bring you happiness and energy, which is something we could all use during these crazy times 🤍✨",2,0

this guy comes out of nowhere.. hes super inspired and then goes on to preach and spend time with his followers for 3 years before hes killed. its like he was living a normal life in obscurity before and then all of a sudden he started to have an episode and that took on a life of its own.

1241,drds6v,I love being Bipolar,"I followed this subreddit in the hopes of finding like-minded individuals who could relate to me, unfortunately I have yet to find that here. I seem to always be a black sheep in almost everything in life. In my family, work and well life. This is a great subreddit though, people are passionate about helping each other out. I have learned of resources like Daylio to see how erratic my behavior has been. I have learned a lot from other people's experience here and this is just a post to kinda vent out my own experience. I have dealt with this condition for all my life and I did not even know I had it until pretty recently. About 2 or 3 years ago. **If you want the tldr just skip all this and you'll be surprised at how I managed to make such a simple thing into this very long post. I like to talk a lot as you'll find out.**

Everything started to make sense, at first I was in denial, but as I read the symptoms and my psychiatrist broke things down for me, it really started to click why I was the way I was. I'm not going to lie, it ain't easy. I have many days where I will blurt out negative and dangerous words about myself. Due to the verbal abuse of my childhood from my uncle and school bullies. I learned those words aren't really me talking and just remnants of the demons of my past. 

* I usually clench my fists and counter with ""No I am a great person and have a lot to live for. Never has there been someone like me. I am a loving soul who is on this Earth to do good."" 

I knew there was something wrong with me since my first psychiatrist visit in the Dominican Republic. I am American, but my mother and father were born there. I was about 17 I'd say. Maybe younger. I told the psychiatrist that I'm always depressed, I was shy, quiet and always in my own world playing video games for far too long. I told him as well under no circumstances will I take any medication. As my father had suffered a stroke recently that we would later find out accelerated his Alzheimer which he now has. I thought at the time the pills were the reason his mental faculties were waning. And that's why I was so against medication at that time. He instead wrote me a prescription for a book... the 7 habits of highly effective people. And this is where my obsession for knowledge began.

* I figured that whatever it is that I had, the solution to curing myself was hidden somewhere in books. If I read enough books maybe I could fix myself. Maybe I could stop being so pathetic and sad. Maybe I could live a happy life.

Fast forward 2 or 3 years I had my first real life-threatening manic episode. I couldn't land a job and my dad's condition worsened. I was so desperate to find a way to help my family that I started hitting up every single family member asking for wisdom or help in getting a job or some incoherent request for salvation from this hell I was living in. I was not eating and was about 98 pounds (I'm 5'7). I went outside and went to a cop and blurted some more incoherent shit. Next thing I know I'm in the hospital. I knew they were going to put me in a mental hospital and I begged my mom to take me away from there because all that they would do is drug me. 

* That is exactly what happened. It was by far the most dehumanizing experience of my entire life. And it only lasted a couple days but for me it felt like an eternity. My best friends and immediate family were the only people who visited me. My reputation from then on was completely in the gutter and people treated me differently. This is when I began to blurt out the most negative thoughts. To this day after 7 years, I still cannot control this impulse. I will say things like ""Kill myself"" or ""I'm a faggot"" or ""I'm such an idiot"". Either under my breath or in my mind or if I'm home I'll say it out loud. The system in place for mental health care is disgusting in this country. To think it use to be so much worse in the past. 

This is why I do not take medication. I do not trust doctors. I will only take medication under certain circumstances. It really only applies to sleep. But these are the reasons I prioritize sleep above all else.

1. If I cannot fall asleep.
   1. If an overwhelming sensation of what I call ""The weight of existence"" hits me where I fear not for my life but my loved one's lives. The thought that anyone I love can die at any minute. It has only happened a handful of times but this fear is so intense I cannot stand it and just want to sleep to reset my mind and go back to my normal self which is the only solution I find to this.
   2. If I am having an intense manic episode. (Hasn't happened in a long time). Only sleep will return me to my senses.

I also during my manic episode became unable to lie and worse yet unable to sleep, which is by far what I grew to hate the most about being Bipolar. I told my best friend's mother that we smoke weed. My Best friend was not too happy about that as he never wanted his mom to find out. We had a falling out and he said he never wanted to see me in his life. I tried to do things like bring him a case of beers. I apologized to no end. I do everything I can to make amends. To no avail. I come to the conclusion that the only way we can be friends again is if I become a better person and show him that I can change.

My mother then takes me to the Dominican Republic where we meet with a doctor who gives me the first medication I take for this disorder (I still had no idea I'm Bipolar). I gain a whopping 40 pounds within a month of taking this new medication. Something I really needed but within a month, thats pretty dangerous I imagine. It shows you the dangers of the medication they give us. I don't advocate for people to get off medication because it is an essential tool for living a productive life. It is simply just something that I have learned to live without. I get back to my city where I'm from and I go visit my friend. He sees me and takes a step back and is dumbfounded at how much weight I've gained. He still wants nothing to do with me, but he can tolerate my presence. His little brother is also my best friend and never got mad at me for any of the stupid stunts I pulled during my manic episodes. His friendship I cherish above all else and is a good reason I'm probably still alive today. Love is a powerful medicine.

I then get my first real job. My millionaire cousin took pity and gave me a job as a bag boy in his store. For a whopping 8 dollars an hour I would kill myself working for him carrying all types of heavy groceries down the conveyor belt and bagging groceries and helping people get it to their car. It was by far the worst job in my life and I got fired from it due to always showing up a bit late. I thank him to this day for teaching me the value of a dollar. I use to respect him, but have come to see him as a money hungry fake family member. He survived a brain tumor which shows how resilient he is but the way he treats some of his employees, I just can't respect a man like that. Many of my family members are rich. I am dirt poor and I can't lie I do not like them. I consider myself in that position, I would prioritize in helping rise all my family from poverty who showed the drive to do so like myself. Not through handouts but IDK, being treated like a crazy person by these people leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kinda like how Thomas treated Joker. Most people will grow to fester a deep hatred. But I still love these people, I just wish they'd give me the opportunity to show them my skills.

Well after I got fired it was during the same week I got accepted into a career training program for inner city youth. Knowing now that if I do not do something and fast I will be destined to work shit jobs the rest of my life. Working with my cousin I would always tell them we'd work together one day as associates. This is where my current obsession with becoming a millionaire by 30 began. I came in and stated my objectives and why I chose to do this program. I want to retire my mom and dad so they no longer need to work. They spent all their money on me and my constant fuck ups. It became clear that the only way they are going to retire is if I pay them back by becoming successful.

I put my heart and soul into this program. I read two books that were key to my success in completing the program with the best internship they had to offer. The 48 Laws of Power. Think and Grow Rich. The combination of the two is what I consider to be the reason I managed to come out of the program with an Internship at Google. Before this however I had no idea of how great Google was or it's reputation for the work environment they had established. I reconnected with my best friend a month before I had to choose my internship and pitch to the class why I want to work there. I only had Harvard and Microsoft in mind, but it was my best friend who told me to do everything in my power to get the Google Internship. And now I get to the point where I say why I love being Bipolar. I was filled with so much positive energy and a strong and impeccable faith that I was going to succeed. And that determination got me to experience some of the best months of my life. 

However once I reached this new level of success, I began to get imposter syndrome. It was hard connecting with my bosses. Me being of Dominican descent, and still having an inferiority complex from my verbal abuse growing up. I gradually started to under perform. I mean I landed consecutive internships from 2014 to 2016. But being forced to go to college to continue the internship was draining me. My father had a tendency to go missing every time finals week came around. I failed every single class and my GPA was in the gutter. Just like High School. By 2016 I found no point in continuing my schooling. It was painfully clear college was not for me. I hate school and I hate learning things that have nothing to do with the work I want to do. I want to learn not study. Where learning I do with passion and studying is more of a chore to memorize and regurgitate information onto a piece of paper. 

So I try to just go for a full-time position as one of the other interns was able to land one without even needing to do an Interview. But then I get the news that I need to do an interview. By then I'm well aware there's no way I'm getting the job. I use to get very nervous during interviews and had little to no experience doing them. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. The invitation for hangouts wouldn't show up on my email. That already wasted 15 min. Then they called me on my damaged iPhone 6. The internal speaker would produce muffled sounds. I knew that my career in Google was over. And I was right. It was only in this year 2019 that I finally mastered the art of interviewing. After failing constantly in many interviews, I learned what to say, how to say it and what questions to ask to differentiate myself from the herd.

Today I still struggle to stay stable. Sometimes I let my emotions best me. Sometimes I say things that end up hurting me in some form. Sometimes I feel very sad. But something that this condition has gifted me is unrivaled positivity and happiness that infects everyone I meet. Through all the books I've read and all the random information I learned because of not being able to sleep. I've gained a power to make friends. Like Naruto my talk-no-jutsu is overpowered. I can make almost anyone like me if I try hard enough. I focus on things that they may like and try to understand them.

I'm now married. I have a wife that believes in me and my potential. I also work as a concierge at a luxury apartment complex. Most of the residents love me. Even the ones who didn't like me at first can't help but like me. I try so hard to pinpoint a way to connect with everyone. My friends are mostly all musicians, insanely talented individuals. My best friend is a programmer whos a certified genius. My other best friends are also talented in music, business and wise beyond their years. A trait we all share due to our collective experience being brought up in the warzone that is the hood and our understanding in the power books have. That's probably a subject for another post in another subreddit though. One of my friends in our mastermind group actually spent time with Bad Bunny recently. Had a private conversation and managed to show him his music. 

Now to finish this incredibly long post which I apologize to anyone who had the attention span to follow this crazy life of mine. While this may just be a symptom of my bipolar disorder to believe I am greater than I actually am. A delusion as most doctors have told me, I've been told by many people growing up that there is greatness in me. Even my former coding professor who is also bipolar told me this recently last month. He worries a lot about me because he knows what we deal with. I will do everything in my power to increase my power so that I can leave this world a better place in one form or the other. I refuse to see myself as a victim and will not make excuses. Action will be the food and drink that will nourish the success I crave so obsessively!

The bipolar disorder was evident (even though I haven't been diagnosed) My mind goes in and out of a fantasy world which varies my mood and therefore sometimes I properly answer the question to the point and on the other hand I decorate the exam paper with my political pet peeves. Like saying bush did 9/11, Donald Trump 2020, Obama care sucks... Well it's was sarcasm that I said Donald trump 2020... 

Anyways, would you consider this a serious case of bipolar? Do I need to get help? DO You think I'll eventually get out of control? 

I have fixed by problem of random shit writing in exams by actually studying.

I wanna know if any of you have cases of bipolar and that you are afraid if it makes you break the law or have no thought of morals and ethics.

My case is writing a derogatory style online and shockingly on a exam paper...

1253,12o7hxp,is bipolar inherently bad?,"warning: probably a mania induced post. my brain is erasing all the bad things and hyping up the good things here.


my experience with bipolar has been pretty up and down, obviously. but i was depressed before the bipolar, on medication for that, and once the bipolar was diagnosed i was switched meds and put on something else. that was changing around for a while too, my mum and my doctor handling all of it.


and since the diagnosis, since the medication, i've been.. better? i much prefer this to depression. i just wasn't functioning like at all. now i feel like i'm more myself. i'm chatty, sociable, it's like how i was when i was younger. my personality is blossoming instead of being hidden by a cloud of blah.


there are the shitty parts, yeah, but can't those be negated by medications? we're getting the mix right. my mania isn't that bad, the worst it has been is like a week long hypomanic episode. 


it's a lifelong thing, unlike depression which i could've overcome. but if i can manage it properly then does it have to be a BAD lifelong thing? i have so much support. i'm super educated on it all and i can tell when i'm getting high and getting low. i have medication and people who'll make sure i take it, and can tell when i'm not. 


really, i've felt better than i have in years. maybe later it'll all go to shit but right now it's been good for me. 


i'm not tryna romanticize this. these are just thoughts i'm having right now in a hypomanic state. later i'll be depressed and pissed at the bipolar. but for now, why not enjoy it?",5,0

1257,rwx02z,Bipolar husband finally broke my last ounce of self worth and dignity with Manic rage,"
For background my husband self medicates with weed, mushrooms and alcohol and is not consistent with his medication. He spends excessively, sleeps all day and gives very little support to our household. I have been supporting us financially for most of the 4 years we have been together. Last year he got his 3rd DUI and now all driving responsibilities fall to me too. 

A couple of weeks ago his doctor added another medication and after only taking it one day his mother told him not to take it. She does not have a medical degree. I don’t even know if he’s been taking his other meds. 

When he takes his medications he is the kindest man and has so much love for me. These past few months his manic episodes are nearly everyday. 

On the 31st of Dec I had an IVF treatment which is very painful for me (not painful for most). On the 1st I woke and took the phone out of my sleeping husbands hand only to find he has been exchanging masturbating videos, sexual messages and general interest in carrying on a relationship with hundred of women, men and transgender women on Kik, Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp etc. there is also a trail of him paying women to make videos for him too. 

- I believe that people can love any person or way they want to love. My hurt has come from bringing hundreds of other people in our marriage which is monogamous and in a way that I consider cheating. 

I hit my final breaking point and confronted him. He grabbed a beer and started drinking again straight away (9am) and only cared about his phone and getting it back. He said some very cruel and vicious things including that he prays I don’t have his baby and he’s not sexually attracted to me that have broken me. He says he’s miserable and I make him want to jump in front of a truck. 

He deleted me on all apps and blocked me when he got his phone back. He was only without it for 10-15 minutes. 

I called his mom for help and my sister took me away to her house. His mom told him I was harassing his family by calling and asking for updates so the only message I have from him is to stop harassing his family. Now his whole family has blamed me for hurting his feelings when I yelled mean things back and breaking our wedding and engagement photos and they have blocked me from all forms of communication.  

I don’t know if they took him to a hospital, if he started taking his meds and if he’s getting the help he needs. 

I’m struggling with so many emotions. Trying to understand his manic behavior and hyper sexuality, why he was cruel, if he really means what he said etc. the main emotion is being blocked and not knowing if he is ok. Should I have stayed and put my pain, hurt and anger aside to help one more time? 

I’m not sure I’ll ever forgive him but he’s my husband and I want to make sure he is safe and alive. Please note he has not apologized or asked for forgiveness. So I don’t know if I’ll ever be in a position to choose if I want to forgive. 

Any help or guidance of how to deal with this situation or advice based on past experience would be appreciated.

1263,4zrhcq,"Unpopular opinion: Self diagnosis isn't bad, it can be a life saver.","Before I was diagnosed with bipolar,  I had a partner with bipolar. I also am very interested in  psychology, so I was pretty well informed.  I am not qualified like a psychiatrist, but I know myself, and I am pretty well read about bipolar.

At the time, I had a psychiatrist who also was my therapist. I had been on medication for depression and anxiety for about 6 months.  My partner picked up pretty clear hypomanic behavior from me.


I told my psychiatrist about this behavior. going from not being able to get out of  bed, to dancing around, sleeping for 3 hours a day, cleaning for 12 hours without a break and thinking I was the best person ever.

My psychiatrists answer?   ' that's your anti-depressant working.' ( i had been on it for 6 months at this stage)

2 weeks later, when i was back to not being able to get out of bed?

' that's how anti-depressants work, they come and go.'


When I went 4 days without sleeping, and went on a spending spree?

'you're stressed, and you're acting out. basically you're a naughty child.'


When I believed that there was ghosts in my room?  
'it's just anxiety'.

When I thought I was sent by a god to  save the world?
'Well, there's nothing wrong there if it doesn't make you unhappy.'


At this stage, I was very much doubting her, but everyone told me 'she's the expert!!'. But she started to tell me things that were very easily disproved.  like  'People with ADHD do not have sleep problems. In fact, it's well known they sleep better than normal people.'

That's when I decided to trust myself, and my partner.  Later on, I have been diagnosed by multiple other professionals.    If I did not trust myself and my partner, and went with the ""the professional is always right"" dogma,,  I would probably be dead.

This is especially true of bipolar.  1/3rd of people  with Bipolar take more than 10 years to get diagnosed with bipolar. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945875/

I had a pretty bad manic episode in January that my significant other still cries over. He petitioned me into a hospital where I stayed for 3 weeks. I got out and was fine with some new meds that I didn't want to have, BUT TAKE.

Unbeknownst to us, I got pregnant a few days after my discharge from the psych ward. 1200mg of lithium a day, 1200 mg of gabapentin a day, 4mg of prazosin a day, and 900-100mg of thorazine a day.

The whole time I begged my outpatient psych to put me back on Abilify and get rid of the Lithium. She dragged me down hella slowly to 450mg of lithium a day and when we all found out I was pregnant (12 weeks of us all being ignorant of the pregnancy) she finally took me off Lithium completely and gave me 10mg of Abilify.

**SIDE NOTE: how in the world do we go from 1200mg of lithium to just 10mg of Abilify to function. they overmedicated me like a motherfucker, I stg.**

My significant other damn near begged me to abort the kid, and I did. His reasoning was because,

""You're on too many medications, you could hurt yourself or the child, you could go manic and end up in the psych ward again leaving me with the child alone.""

My mother wasn't much better. Her main points for aborting was because of me being plain ole bipolar...she begged me to not only abort the child but to also get my tubes tied.

I'm at a loss tbh. I just found this community and it's been almost three weeks since the abortion.

1275,q42ph5,Molly on bipolar meds. What’s your experience?,"Hi I’ve been diagnosed bipolar 2 and I was prescribed 500mg Divalproex (aka Depakote/Valporic Acid) and 50mg Quetiapine (aka Seroquel). I’ve only been prescribed very recently and I literally just bought the meds but I’m hesitant to start taking them yet bc I plan to roll in 3 weeks for halloween - it’s my first roll in 2 years and before I took a break, I used to roll ALOT - in raves and house parties and I dabbled with psychedelics, coke, valium and sometimes a mix of those so I knew how much I could handle at that time. There was also a time I was on SSRI (Lexapro) and it really dulled my roll which made me take more ecstasy than I would usually take - totally do NOT recommend this. It was risky and I was reckless. But I was fine, I didn’t experience serotonin syndrome or any other serious effects… LUCKILY. Never experienced a severe depressive crash as well, I just felt physically tired and I felt the tingling afterglow. 

Today, I am more wary on what I take and I haven’t really been taking anything except smoke some pot. I’m really looking forward to rolling again but would just like to know if I need to go off these meds a few days before I roll or would it not interfere with my roll at all? 

PS. I know it’s not recommended to take mdma when on bipolar meds - I’m aware of the risks and I appreciate the concern - but I’m really keen on taking some in 3 weeks, I would like to hear from people who have knowledge or experience about this so I can weigh it out and prepare for my roll.

I am done with this country preaching about their right to own guns and having so many I live in the South, and everyone is a hunter or owns a gun that I know. NRA stickers on the back of jacked up pickups, it’s so annoying and frustrating. 

Now that yet another mass shooting happened 5 (!) of my friends have shared the same exact post that the pussification and lack of discipline has led to too many mental illness diagnosis’s and that we should be worried that those that are mentally ill will be getting guns and shooting randomly. Their solution take away guns from mentally ill, lock them away and medicate them! 

About that, those I’m friends with are very non violent, I’m a very passive person. I used to get angry easily but I was more likely to take off and go somewhere to cool off. I’ve been bipolar since I was 13, diagnosed at 27, married now for almost 9 years. I’m 31 now in cbt therapy long term, I’m on medication and I’m not a danger to anyone. I’m just a mother and a wife trying to do the best I can.

I am SO DONE with the whole mental illness causes mass shootings! Blame the real cause in my opinion kids that don’t care about anyone that’ll kill because they can. It’s not the mentally ill, don’t blame the weird kids, I was a weird kid who read books at recess and stuck to myself because I have severe anxiety and people are hard to get to know. Just because I am bipolar doesn’t mean I’m going to get a gun and shoot up a church or a school. I don’t want a gun I shot tin cans as a kid, I know gun safety, I was taught by my uncles how to be safe with guns. But I don’t want a gun, I don’t hunt, I don’t want one for safety, I live in a small safe town. 

If we are going to talk about gun violence leave the mentally ill out of it until you know for certain that he was in fact diagnosed with it. I’m bipolar, my brother has major depression. My great grandma was undiagnosed bipolar, it’s genetic in our case. There are violent video games blame them, blame parents not disciplining their kids blame who you want but don’t point fingers and make us more ashamed to be sick. I hate sharing my struggles I’ve been told secondhand that it’s an excuse and over diagnosed. 

That’s my say in it, I’m so so annoyed about it and I pray that they don’t take away my treatment, or flag my account both instagram, Reddit and Facebook, because I am sick, I don’t post anything bad but with this going on it’s like a witch hunt out to get us that are sick! ",3,0

1286,hvklwg,You are not bipolar - there is no such thing as being bipolar.,"You are not bipolar, you *have* bipolar. Having bipolar is not *being* bipolar. You can have a shit without being a shit.

You can have bipolar, live with bipolar, manage bipolar, struggle with bipolar, suffer with bipolar and many other things with bipolar. But unless you are a sentient abstract noun, you cannot actually *be* bipolar.

I know this is perhaps a trivial linguistic quibble. I'm sure I myself have lapsed into using this language unconsciously. But it gets my goat when I notice it. We are not an illness, we are human beings affected by one.  


EDIT: I do get that bipolar has an adjectival form but that is what I'm objecting to. You can 'be' gay or blonde or x as *part* of what makes up your identity. Of course, the last thing I want to do is police anyone's identity. On reflection, I think the analogy I think I have in mind is that I find it anomalous that illnesses generally don't have adjectival forms in this way - we never say somebody 'is cancer', or 'is heart disease', or even 'is myopia'. We don't even say someone is depression or mania, we say they either that have those things or that they are depressed or manic.  
   
Perhaps some people have different feelings because a psychological condition is a little more intimate and personal than a physical condition - I don't know. I am not sure how I feel about this line of thinking myself. Friends and family I know are cancer survivors - for a younger member of my family particularly that is something that has shaped and strengthened her personality in important ways; in that sense it is an important aspect of her identity that I hope she will take ownership of and be proud of as she grows up. But I would never wish a potentially lethal, distressing, painful and life-shattering illness on anyone. Personally, especially since we live in a society where we are too often defined too much by other people by our condition, I prefer to register my small linguistic protest by *having* an illness rather than by being it.  
Other people with bipolar will have different preferences and I respect that. I am more concerned with people at large not respecting those of us for whom the locution of 'being' bipolar jangles somewhat. :)

1291,8nwlld,I really hate what kanye is doing right now,"He's probably the worst person to represent bipolar disorder and, honestly, I think his album might be making it *worse* for the rest of us.

There are a ton of problems.  He hasn't talked about treatment or recovery at all.  He is embracing ""crazy"" behavior and making that part of his public persona.  He talks about embracing Trump, his stupid comment about slavery, and saying he's worried about the #MeToo movement.  He hasn't moved away from his horrible behavior at the Grammys.  In other words, if any of these are actually symptomatic, he's **embracing** his symptoms rather than talking about **overcoming** them.

Calling Bipolar a ""superpower"" in this context is awful.  I think everyone has had the feeling of manic energy feeling like a superpower - and sometimes it does fuel bouts of productive energy.  But that doesn't come anywhere close to telling the full story.  And, in this context, it is basically doubling down on his bad behavior.

And here's the worst part: **the most controversial things about Kanye are related to his *stupidity,* not his moods.**

Saying ""slavery was a choice"" is just fucking stupid.  Embracing Trump and the comments he made about the Black community and democrats is just fucking stupid.

Then on the album Kanye says this:

""Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too // I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd  //  Thinkin' what if that happened to me too  //  Then I'm on E! News""

This is just fucking stupid.

I loved *The College Dropout* and *Late Registration.*  There's a lot of emotionally real things he talks about on those albums, and he's much more articulate.  I didn't see any of that on what he just released.

He is reiterating and reinforcing all the negative stereotypes about people with Bipolar disorder.  He brought *nothing* to the table in terms of the complexity of the disease.  His stupid-ass cover art plays into the worst misconceptions of what this disease is.  He is basically putting on a show of all irrational things that people believe about Bipolar, and blasting it back to the public with a megaphone.

1296,zuagnh,Is it ever OK to tell someone you think they may be bipolar?,"I was recently diagnosed, and I have very similar personality traits & behavior patterns to a couple of people in my life -- one of my good friends, and my ex from several months ago.

I'm wondering if it's alright to mention to someone that you think they may be demonstrating bipolar symptoms? Or that you think they may benefit from seeing a psychiatrist? No one ever told me that, and I'm 34 now... I had to come across bipolar type 2 on my own. I really wish someone would have pointed me in this direction, sooner.

My ex has been working really hard to get his mental health under control. I think he might appreciate hearing this, but he also has some potential Borderline tendencies, with being aggressive at times, and not trusting people. I just think he may benefit from this, and I feel obligated to share, because of how much I've seen him suffering. I was thinking about sending him a kindly worded email about how I was diagnosed, and that we seem to have similar behaviors, with some links to youtube videos for more information.

With my friend, I'm not sure how to say it... or if I should. She's been making reckless life choices since going on Lexapro, and she's had what she calls ""mental breakdowns"" in the past. There's some hypersexuality and abnormal behavior happening. I might just try to continue being a concerned friend.

I'd just appreciate any input. My intentions are coming from a good place... I know it might be overstepping boundaries, but I just feel like no one else in their life is pointing these things out to them... and they could be so much better off, if they got help.",3,0
1297,yevfs3,I found the cure! …and it’s Tiktok,"If the title sounds like a clickbait tabloid article, good.

Here’s what I know: when I’m depressed, tiktok is a soft comforting glowing screen of entertainment to distract me from myself. When I’m hypomanic, tiktok lets me lie in bed all day, racking up dopamine hits in a way that bothers nobody and keeps my bank account safe. It brings me slightly up from depression and brings me down off my hypomania, turning me into useless, mushy state of nothingness.

Tiktok is the cure! It removes you from yourself! Stops you from feeling the bad parts of bipolar life! And all the other parts of life too!

1301,p6wn6f,Reasons why I don't take meds - Also have NOTHING against others taking meds and they might work for many!,"As the title says, I decided to make this post since from today I don't have a psych anymore and I'm off my meds for 2 months doing fine (for now) and I'm aware of this

I've been on medication for over a year, there was a mix back a fourth testing things out but ultimately this was my cocktail:

* **Quetiapine** 200 mg a day
* **Olanzapine** 10 mg a day
* **Venlafaxine** 150 mg a day
* **Sodium Valporate** 600 mg a day
* **Lamotrigine** 200 mg a day
* **Piracetam** 1200 mg a day

So, this combination generally worked well, can't say it haven't regarding my mental state. The thing is that it came with some really horrible side effects killing my self esteem and daily life. Surprised huh? 

I've gotten into obese BMI really fast, I've been counting calories for months along with fasting and just COULDN'T get rid of the weigh gain. I just kept on being bigger, taking every comment regarding my looks really personally and it hurt really bad killing my self esteem. Right now my appetite is way lower. I'm really unable to eat too much, could call my eating child portions but I just eat normally without counting calories but I can easily tell when I'm full. I lost 35 lbs already, which is crazy and people might just call me out saying I MUST be on stimulants but I'm not. I feel so much better in my own skin right now, no longer not taking off my shirt at the beach.

Second thing, I guess it's more complex for men is ED and not the kind of ED you might be thinking of right now, I'm talking about Erectile Dysfunction with a complete loss of libido. I mean my lower part was just not working, completely. Could not get erect, doesn't matter how hard I tried and never orgasmed while on Venlafaxine. I felt like I'm less of a man, just crying about what the fuck I'm doing to myself and constantly thinking about why I'm doing this. 

Moving over to the mental part, I've become a emotionless robot. I wasn't depressed, sure it's a great thing. Neither in a manic state. It's just that I couldn't cry of feel bad about somebody in situations where I should. Like someone getting hurt or a loss of a close one, like it was gone. I became empty, I wasn't feeling bad or good just ""meh"" and ""whatever"".  My mind became slow and I was constantly tired

Once again guys, I've seen how posts like mine turn out. Just because someone mentions being off meds they are hated for it why? I don't think you guys shouldn't, medication might work for you and tolerating some side effects. I just wanted to speak up my honest opinion, thanks for reading :)",3,0

I work as a scientist and sometimes, as science goes, the results make no sense. To figure out what is happening, I need to remember details from papers I have read 5 years ago, or textbooks that I have read 10 years ago. Then create very ""loose"" associations to make up a hypothesis and essentially figure out a novel experimental set-up to to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Normally this is next to impossible. 

I have figured out that I can induce ""manic"" state by not eating for a day. I prefer to call it hyper state. In hyper state, I have borderline photographic memory and have way ""outside of the box"" ideas. 

The issue is that my brain cannot handle it for very long and I start seeing images. First flies everywhere, then bigger objects like cars or animals. That is a sure sign I need to stop, otherwise I also start hearing voices. I say that I am sick and take a few days off. I just just lie in bed and let the depression hit. If I have not used the hyper state for too long, the depression lasts just a few days.

1306,eod320,Boderline personnality disorder? Why It seem to me a diagnostic error and should be include in the bipolar spectrum.,"I originaly posted this in a comment, but I think it could be an interesting post to start discussion...

I see the downvote and I probably trigger some bad shit for people. Wich wasn't my intention. I'm sorry. I dont  want to deny any suffering from people who receceived a bdp diagnostic.  Your suffering is real, no doubt about it. So I'll try to explain more my critic of the bdp diagnostic as how it's  made in the dsm.

 1: I hate the personnality disorder part. lt's written like it's  a flaw from the personnality itself and not an actual illness that the person suffer from. An illness is something  we need to treat, a personnality is something that define a person (so  it's  kind of his own fault).

2: a lot of criteria seem copied from the old hysteria diagnostic  who was clearly misogynist. In that sense, a clear majority of bdp people are woman. 

3: a lot of the bdp person had suffer from trauma in their childhood or later in life. There's a lot of sexual agression, abusive parenting, violence.......  in their history. So many symptoms of bdp like trouble maintaining relationship, depersonnalization, feeling rejected, abandonned, bad self esteem... are normal response to trauma. 

4: The variation of mood may be in a shorter lap, but it's still thymic episode. It fit the original description of cyclothymia by Ludwig Kahlbaum. There was'nt this idea of lower intensity of episode like in today criteria. The main difference was the lenght of the episode. So this is why I emphase of bdp being a sub type of the affective bipolar illness.

5: This diagnostic come with too much stigma. Stigma that are calidated by the medical system. When someone received a bdp diagnostic where I live, they have to do group therapy, that dont suit everybody. ( i personnally like group therapy). They are also exclude from some psychosocial service that could help them because of how they are view by the medical system. Also, the meds are not systematically used and often ssri can be used alone or with only anxiolitic. When there's a tons of evidence that those meds are not good for people who experience high and down, when they aren't paired with mood stabilizer. 

In conclusion, I dont  pretend to own the truth. I'm just highly critical on the dsm over impact  in modern psychiatry. I feel we need more research and a scientific approach detach from psychanalist.

1331,11qwsdy,My girlfriend lied about her ex.,"I just found out that my girlfriend’s ex is a different person from the person she has been telling me. It is her churchmate. She has been telling me that her ex was someone else. She didn’t lie about what happened to her with her ex, it’s just that, it was a different person. That’s all. 

We have been dating for two months, and I believe she went to their church sometime last month. She also had me think that she is not using Facebook anymore when we met. But, when I got to be close to her family, I found out about her Facebook. I stalked it, and found a guy liking and commenting on her photos in the past. I confronted her about who it was. She said, it was her ex that she had been telling me, but it was just a different person.

I actually don’t give a fuck about her past, it’s just that, it hurts me knowing that she made me believe it was a different person. So now, I’m starting to think she might still be in love with him, or she might have seen him sometimes. But she told me it had been like a year since she saw him. She said she had trauma with that person that’s why she had decided to forget everything about him. She just doesn’t want me to know about him because I’m telling you, the way she said to me about that guy in the beginning was really traumatizing.

Last night, I gave her a chance to explain everything to me because I want to continue our relationship. I told her to explain everything to me, no lies, just all truths. I asked her about the timeline because I don’t know, the timeline of her breaking up with him seems pretty essential to me. I was squeezing her out about the details, I sounded like a fucking creepy investigator, but I just wanted to tell her the truth. There were some timelapse in her story and I kept asking her like when and how. She got frustrated and started to call me toxic. We did not get the chance to finish the story. She said she told me everything and she’s telling the truth, why don’t I just fucking believe her. If I won’t trust her anymore, it’s better to end this relationship. 

Now, I’m starting to think to stop this because I know myself, it might get a while before I forget this. I am kind of guy who forgives, but I don’t forget. Ever. But, I love her. It think what we had in the last few months was amazing.

1341,4me49k,"Bipolar II or Unipolar Depression with Random ""Ups""? (I have been diagnosed by one psychiatrist, but there are doubts)","I've been diagnosed with Bipolar II (or Bipolar NOS -- I got differing info from the people who are treating me) with Psychotic Features. I have paranoid delusions, and auditory hallucinations with two voices that speak in my head and cause vocal outbursts. Before I was diagnosed with Bipolar (which was about a week ago), I had a Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis. However, I was having much shorter, infrequent episodes different from my depressive episodes where I felt elated, energized, excited, but restless, irritable and impulsive. I had a lot of focus on projects I was doing. I didn't like to be interrupted. Got TONS of work done. At the same time I was very touchy and agitated.

I suffer from intense anxiety and agoraphobia separate from the Bipolar/Unipolar depression, whatever it is, and that usually curbs me from any impulsive activities like gambling, drinking, going out and getting laid a lot, but  I do have urges to be impulsive and spontaneous, storm outside into the snow, self-harm, drink a lot at home, binge eat. I don't have any money to spend as I can't work right now (or complete school) because of the extreme level of my anxiety (which might be related to trauma in my past). However, this state feels like a COMPLETE switch from my depression, not just a couple of good days here and there, which is why I think it might be hypomania. Just a few days ago I went from feeling hopeless, exhausted all the time, no motivation to do anything to a  sudden surge of energy, creativity, motivation and focus and the compulsion to just do spontaneous/impulsive things (within the comfort of my home). (My libido has also risen from the dead for some awesome Skype-sex with my boyfriend last night). This has happened several times, fairly infrequently compared to the length and frequency of the depressive episodes.

I'm going through one of those episodes right now, and my self-confidence feels like it's through the roof, and I feel great compared to the depression. I feel great, happy, more elated than I have in my life ever. I'm having trouble sitting still and want to work on big projects. I'm in an outpatient program right now and I literally could not sit in class because of my need to ""do something"". 

Has anyone had unipolar depression where they felt like this infrequently? I know my possible hypomania isn't as extreme with the impulsiveness as some other people, but it's so, SO different from my depression and lasts for weeks before the depression comes back and it's like an off-switch to my on-switch I'm experiencing now.

I don't want to feel like I'm clinging on to a Bipolar diagnosis, it's just I want to make sure I'm getting the right treatment and know if something is possibly going to affect me for life.  

Does this sound familiar to anyone who is sure they are Bipolar II? I know none of what you guys say is a psychiatrist's final decision, but I've had one psychiatrist give me the diagnosis, the other one go along with it until I mentioned my intense anxiety today, and now I believe he's considering that what might be ""hypomania"" is just anxiety.  But I personally feel that it's not. My anxiety feels different, and I get it just as intense when I'm down as when I'm up. The elation and energy is something that doesn't come along with my anxiety during depression, and it's definitely present during these episodes.

1352,3bp1cd,Definition of bipolar? Am I bipolar?,"Isn't it like.. going from happy to sad pretty quickly and or often?
Like if I'm at work calling people and the first two are nice etc I feel pretty good and I'm motivated to do as well as I can that day. Then the third call the person is annoying and hangs up in the middle of the thing(waste of 3-10 minutes depending..) and I just feel like the whole fucking day is RUINED. I'll keep calling cus I have to but I am no longer motivated to do as well as I can - the bare minimum or below is fine.
Might tie in with me being somewhat of a perfectionist - now I'm 'behind' 10 minutes. 

Or I'll be home listening to music feeling fine/good and I get reminded of something I hate comming up(have to do x tomorrow, have to do y soon) and my mood is just bleh. No longer feeling good, just anxious about whatever I'm not looking forward to.

1353,3alm7h,Do I have bipolar disorder? 20/M,"First off, sorry for breaking the 'do not attempt to diagnose yourself' rule, but I feel like people here may be able to provide some insight.

The first time I experienced any real mental health issues was about 19 months ago. It all started with insomnia - I became unable to sleep for more than a few hours on most nights. For a while this didn't really affect me that badly, while a little sleep deprived I maintained a relatively good mood most of the time.

Inevitably though, the insomnia began to take its toll on life. My attendance at university slipped drastically, and when I did make it into lectures or tutorials I would be far too sleep deprived to absorb any knowledge from it. So I made an appointment with a local GP and was prescribed some sedatives.

This helped with the insomnia, moderately, but I soon began to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression. These worsened over the course of a couple of months and culminated in undoubtedly the worst mindset I have experienced to date. I experienced frequent panic attacks; terrifying sleep deprived delusions in which I would stare at myself in the mirror and watch my face morph into completely different shapes and forms; a pervasive feeling of hopelessness and frequent thoughts of suicide. I went to see a GP and was diagnosed with insomnia, depression and anxiety and prescribed an SSRI.

I took the SSRI for about 9 months after this. It got me out of the bad place I was in, but I didn't particularly like how I was while taking it either. My anxiety was gone, but to the point where I didn't particularly care about anything, including things that I needed to have some degree of concern about in order to function. This care-free stupor was punctuated by brief hysterical lows in which I would feel intense suicidal feelings - worse even than those before I had been taking medication. This would occur once every couple of weeks, and last only a day or two. While in this state I would do things such as plan ways to kill myself (and come very close to going through with them on occasion); cry hysterically in front of family members; or take cocktails of prescription medications in high doses which I took from my stepdad's medicine cabinet. I knew this would either get me high in some way or potentially do me some damage depending on the particular cocktail, but at the time that seemed like a pretty good deal either way.

So eventually I discontinued the antidepressants, probably around 9 months ago. I'm very glad to say I've not experienced anything like the first depressive phase since then, but my mood is still a little unsteady.

I still struggle with insomnia, but it comes and goes and is usually somewhat more manageable. My mood these days is quite varied though. Most often I feel a little low - not severely depressed like before, just not particularly happy or enthusiastic about anything. When I'm around friends I perk up a lot and often have fun, and as a result I try to avoid spending time alone as much as possible. When on social outings with friends I will often be incredibly enthusiastic and energetic; dance a lot; be very talkative etc. I've also had quite a lot of casual sex lately which up until a few months ago I've never done before, and on occassion have been using various street stimulants a little more recklessly than I perhaps usually would.

A lot of these things do seem similar to the symptoms of bipolar disorder I have read about. However, there doesn't really seem to be any pattern to my mood lately. I've read that bipolar phases often last a few weeks at a time. This doesn't fit with my experience since discontinuing the antidepressants. While my mood is rather variable and goes between quite intense loneliness and apathy (only really occurs when alone) and quite intense joyfullness, most of the time it doesn't cycle in such a way. Even if I've been feeling low, I can usually go on some sort of social outing the same day and still be very happy and energetic. I have had a couple of weeks in which i've felt pervasively low and not wanted to see friends as much, but these are pretty rare.

So that's pretty much it. I'd be interested to hear ways in which this is similar or different to your own experiences so I can weigh up whether there's any likelihood of me being bipolar. I know it might be better to go to a professional than to reddit here, but whenever I visit doctors I find it incredibly difficult to describe anything coherently - I just become a stammering mess and neither me or the doctor is any the wiser about what the problem is. I'd like to avoid it if possible.",1,0

For instance when I come out to someone I usually begin by saying, ""I am possibly the craziest person you know. Seriously.""

But is that OK? I've also experienced the word's derogatory use first hand. It is not respectful. Should we oppose it by not using the word? As a bi man I don't call gays or other bi's ""fags"". 

A second problem with the word is that it's minimally descriptive. Because of that it lumps together a lot of different conditions. Autism spectrum counts as crazy, but also bipolar II. Maybe it's better to be more specific so people better understand that mental illnesses (in the broadest sense) can take many forms, with many different symptoms and limitations. 

But maybe we just co-opt the word?

1364,2m3b8a,I'm really upset at my pdoc..,"Little history about why I stopped taking my meds to begin with: I've had issues with chronic nausea because of my gallbladder for years. It got so bad that I couldn't take my meds anymore because I was too sick. After having my gallbladder out a couple of weeks ago I started taking my meds again (after about a week so I can confirm no nausea). when i started them again i found that the gallbladder nausea was masking nausea from my medication (viibryd- an antidepressant) So I stopped all meds until I could see my pedoc which was today.

I posted here a bit back saying that I was feeling pretty good off my meds and I knew i needed to go back on them but didn't feel like it. You convinced me that I really needed to get back to my meds. (which was when I found out they made me sick)

anyway, I went in today and let her know that, since being off my meds, I was pretty okay as long as nothing in my life went wrong. when something did though I became overwhelmed, anxious, nervous, irritable and went from snapping at people to crying. I couldn't handle pretty much anything.

Her response was that it wasn't the bipolar, it was just stress, and that I didn't need to go back on meds since I was doing so well. I told her that bipolar people CAN be stable for a while but then eventually we'll hit an episode and then it may be too late. She said that what I experiencing wasn't hypomania or depression (because i wasn't suicidal) so it didn't really count and that not being able to handle anything wasn't due to the bipolar... as if bipolar doesn't effect stress in any way. 

I did convince her to put me back on meds (abilify and prozac now) and there's no point in finding someone else because she's leaving the practice before even my next appointment. But I trusted her and the fact that she even thought that a bipolar person would be okay long term without meds shocked me and really upset me. That kind of dismissal of the severity of bipolar and the statistics of people on vs off meds can kill someone. I definitely won't be recommending her to anyone... ",0,0
1365,2dyurk,SO has been acting super weird over past 2 months. Could it be bipolar?,"I have to admit that I know absolutely nothing about bipolar disorder. Last I ever learned of it it was either wild mood swings for every other month or something similar that I learned from my friends back in high school who knew equally nothing as I did. 


My SO of about 5 months has been acting differently for the past 2 months. About every other week or every two weeks we'll have an *amazing* time together, just the best time of my life, and then we'll have absolutely terrible times together, nothing to talk about. She also goes on upset rants about something I do almost every other day (e.g. one day she says I'm too touchy with her in public, the next day she says I don't touch her enough and wants me to hold her in public more).

She has mentioned to me before how she was recommended to go to a therapist by her family doctor about a year and a half ago, but she hasn't made the commitment yet. Initially she couldn't because of her lack of insurance, but now she has insurance and still hasn't really made any effort to see a doctor as far as I know.

We've been on a very bad road for the past month and a half and it sounds like we're at the make/break point. Honestly at this point I'm not so much worried about myself as I am about her/her future -- if this is some kind of bipolar disorder I really want her to be seen by a doctor but I don't know how to word it without it basically meaning ""you're crazy"" (which, incidentally, when I jokingly said that to her before, she became really upset). I'm not even sure if the things I described above could be some symptom of bipolar disorder or if she's just a really needy girl who has to have everything perfect.

To telling me she later flew out to California, right after our break-up, to have sex with her ex, every day, for four days, twice a day. And then said. ""I don't want to hurt you. Just say goodbye"" over a text. Then, refusing to respond.

It happened. Unprovoked. I hadn't said one mean thing to her since December.

She smokes, lives messily, had a kid at 19, has a drinking problem and often, for no reason, will tell me something bad about myself. I decided to never speak to her again, although I obviously responded to those texts in mean ways, calling her mean names... To which I wish I had better character.

She won't take medicine like previously and now thinks that the disorder is just POOF, gone. Will she take responsibility? Oh, she also called me while having sex with him when that happened, then lied to me when I told her I would never speak to her again. (I believed her, quite stupidly).

I know all bipolar people aren't horrible. But I've read quite a lot of horrible stories and have been treated horribly for a long time. I just want to know, will she feel bad someday? Will she regret it? It was always my fault in the relationship, but she told me I'm the only guy who had something going for him that she dated, let alone in her life.

I remember once me and her daughter were crying over her drinking problem, but even then, she wouldn't take responsibility.

I've either gotten side effects galore, the med in question was like a sugar pill to me (did nothing), or I had some kind of strong, adverse reaction to the med. 

I saw a chiropractor today, as I've had back pain since I was literally 7 years old. Today, I learned I have an abnormal curvature in my spine, and my hips are displaced. So, I have a theory. The chiropractor only done an xray of the lower part of my back. She didn't xray my middle or upper back. What if I have a nerve pressing against my brain or some shit? Wouldn't that mess me up and give me bipolar-like symptoms and explain why bipolar medication isn't working to treat it? Hmm... I suppose my next course of action is to find a rheumatologist or someone who can order a CT scan (with dye) to get a look at my brain and see what's going on. Idk. I'm not a doctor.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of energy, it was the age of weakness. It was the epoch of euphoria, it was the epoch of despair.

Charles Dickens’ echoes through my head when I think about Gwen. The highs are so high when I’m with her, and as soon as she’s away from me, the lows are so very low. 

Our relationship has been an emotional rollercoaster ever since I met her. 

Walking into that quaint coffee shop with $8 lattes and a cozy library in the back(to justify those gouging dollar signs I guess), was the best and worst decision of my life. 

You were reading *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath, flitting your aquamarine irises across the pages through the lenses of those hipster style glasses that just made you look like an adorable librarian. 

I sat down across from you.

“Are you also a mentally ill fashion writer trying to make it big in New York City?”

God that was a terrible pick up line.

She replied, “Would that make you Buddy Willard? The creepy guy that degrades my writing and exposes himself to me?”

I laughed, because the joke was funny, and because that was the only way I knew how to hide my anxiety talking to women. 

“Alright well if I’m Buddy, would you be excited if I asked you to grab drinks with me at a dive bar instead of to the Yale Prom?”

It took a few minutes of actual normal conversation to convince her I wasn’t just a walking-talking husk of a human, hiding behind characters etched into paper, before she agreed to meet me later that night. 

That night turned into multiple nights of exhilarating fun and authentic connection, and eventually, mornings, with *breakfast*.

By the time you were my girlfriend Gwen, I was completely in love. Not just infatuation, but I really deeply cared about you, not for the feeling it gave me; I simply wanted the very best in life for you.

6 months after I met you in that coffee shop, I was eating dinner with you and your phone was right-side-up on the table when it buzzed from a text message. I watched as you picked it up, typed your reply with a smile on your face, and put it face down on the table. I didn’t think anything of it, but as soon as you had scarfed down your food you told me you had to go run some errands and would be back later. Again, not suspicious.

My perception changed when I logged into Venmo later that night. My friend had requested me to pay him back for the ice cream he bought me the other day. I happened to see her name pop up in the friends list feed, paying “Jason” for “Long Island Iced Tea from a new friend :).” Gwen wasn’t running errands, unless that errand involved splitting drinks with a “new friend.”

I was lying in bed awake, thoughts racing, when Gwen opened the door and stumbled back into my place. 

“Hey babe, sorry I was over at Julia’s place and we had a drink or two.”

It was definitely on the side of 2, two shots, two mixed drinks, and two beers maybe.

“That’s ok, next time tell me where you’re going. I thought you were running errands?”

It took her a second to make up an excuse. 

“I was on the way to the store when Julia texted me, so I bought some wine and cheese and we had a little girls night in.”

That was the moment that I *knew*. 

I just decided to go to bed. I didn’t really want to confront her without having a night to think. She tried to climb under the covers with me but I honestly was very uncomfortable with that. I got up and told her I was going to sleep on the couch because I was having trouble falling asleep and I wanted to watch TV.

The next morning I made breakfast and decided to give her another chance to come clean. When she came into the kitchen I looked her in the eye and said,

“So where were you *really* last night?”

She replied, “What do you mean? I was at Julia’s all night. It was just me and her drinking wine and watching TV.”

“Ok so then who is Jason?”

Dumbfounded, her face confirmed everything that I already believed to be true. She didn’t even respond, she just walked away. I think she knew, that I knew, that she was cheating on me. She left her phone in the kitchen though, and I didn’t wanna leave anything to chance. I unlocked it and scrolled through her texts. I clicked on Jason, and there was a text from last night *after* she came back to my place. It said, “Hey Jasonnn ;) thank you for a good time. I never expected a short king like you to have such a big di–”

I slammed her phone on the counter. 

“Gwen! Get the fuck in here right now.”

“What?”

“Do you even love me? I know you’re cheating on me, was it just a hookup or do you even give a shit about how I feel?”

“Honestly, I don’t think I ever loved you. I’m sorry but I think I just *liked* you, and now I don’t.” 

She shrugged, as if it was some passing remark, incapable of affecting my emotions. But to *me,* it was as if she took my heart and threw it in a wood chipper. 

I dissociated for a moment, violent images of the mass of meat descending into those sharp slicing teeth. The ventricles were spurting blood 10 feet in the air, and then landing on my face and in my eyes. It started red and then transitioned into a deep, inky black. I looked down at my hands and all I could see was black, void of anything but darkness. The murky liquid dripped down my face and eventually blinded me, searing pain radiated outward. I wiped my face with my hands and then I was back in the kitchen.

“Gwen, get the fuck out of my place. Right now. I want you to pack all of your things. I want you to walk out that door, and keep walking. Walk out of my life.”

I grabbed my wallet, put on my shoes, and slammed the door behind me. I headed to my coke dealer’s apartment and picked up a financially irresponsible amount. Then I hit the club. 

The handicap stall looked like a blizzard by the time I got done with it. A warm and numb sensation crept its way into my face. My vision was razor sharp and my confidence exploded into an impenetrable suit of armor. Nobody could stop me. I pushed my way through the crowd to dance. The DJ obviously knew I was there. Every song he played was for me, I was the only one in that mass of sweat and shiny clothing that belonged there. Every girl that looked at me wanted me. I could see it in their eyes. 

Then I hit the slopes once more. I could feel every grain of powder enter my bloodstream, each line further numbing my face. When I left the bathroom I couldn’t feel my body. I had entered another.  I was astral projecting into a celebrity. I could tell that every person I talked to just wanted an autograph and a bit of my time. Every drink I pounded felt like water, like nothing. I wasn’t the life of the party, I *was* the party.

I started talking to this girl that really needed a Commercial Driving License for that *Dump Truck* of an ass. She took me back to her place and poured me tequila shot after tequila shot before we got it on. Hearing her moan with ecstasy only added to my high, every movement of her hips piercing me with euphoria. 

After the orgasm had faded and the post-ejaculatory regret kicked in, I put my clothes back on and wandered the streets. I was coming down off the cocaine and the alcohol had shifted from intoxicant to simply depressant.

I saw a woman walking with her boyfriend, her arm linked in his. The way they talked they just seemed perfect for each other, totally in love. When they got to a crosswalk I heard her say, “Jared, this is exactly how I imagined falling in love when I was a little girl. I really feel like you’re my soulmate.” They kissed passionately under the streetlights, the light perfectly reflecting off the puddles on the pavement, creating a blurry bokeh. 

The words of Sylvia Plath were suddenly in my ear.

“There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in the room. It's like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the opposite direction--every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it's really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and excitement at about a million miles an hour.”

I lit up a cigarette and began to stroll towards the “bad part of town.” I didn’t really walk this way very often but I honestly had no regard for my safety. I just wanted to feel something. Even anxiety would have been welcome, the fight or flight can be exhilarating at times. I craved that blood pumping, high energy, euphoric at times rush that adrenaline can provide. I used to bungee jump and drive a motorcycle because I was addicted to it. Eventually the rush wasn’t enough though. I built a tolerance to it. I also just didn’t have anybody to share those experiences with these days. 

All my friends had moved away and stopped responding to my texts or just stopped making plans with me. I truly was alone except for when I was with Gwen. That’s probably why she left me, she realized that nobody really liked me, and she wasn’t sure she did anymore. It was an easy decision for her apparently. 

I sat down on a beer crate in the abode of a homeless man living under a subway overpass. He started talking about how he was dope sick because he couldn’t afford another hit of smack. At this point I didn’t give a single fuck about what was the “responsible” or “acceptable” decision. Nobody was going to stop me, nobody was going to tell me what to do.

I told him I would pay for his bag if he hooked me up with his guy. He jolted up from his “chair” and told me to follow him. 20 minutes later I had a syringe in my hand and my new friend “Sam” was wrapping a belt around my bicep. 

This was it. I should have been nervous but I just felt nothing. I had no feelings anymore, that wood chipper hollowed me out. My chest cavity had no heart, just an inky black slime remained.

I missed Gwen. She made me stable, prevented me from going on benders like this. Now I had nothing to live for. If I wasn’t ever going to be enough for her how could I ever be happy in life? My family had never loved me. One day they went on vacation and the babysitter dropped me off at a foster home. I was 4 years old, unlovable, but abandonable. 

It seemed like abandonment had finally caught up with me once again. Sam prepared the needle and asked me how much I wanted. I told him I didn’t want to wake up. He seemed to understand and we walked up the road so that he wouldn’t be associated with what was to happen. 

I remembered thinking deeply about suicide methods when I had read *The Bell Jar* years ago. Plath wrote, “The trouble about jumping was that if you didn't pick the right number of stories, you might still be alive when you hit bottom.”

A knife was too painful and there was too much blood(believe me I hate blood that's why that wood chipper hallucination came to mind so readily). Pills were just a pussy move, if it was gonna be drugs I wanted to do something really *bad*, something you really shouldn’t do if you want to live a good life. And guns were too quick, no drama.

When I finished that section, I decided I was gonna make it heroin. For being so bad for you, it's so romanticized by society. I remember seeing this quote from a Polish politician when he was advocating for more sensible drug policies, “A jump from the sixth floor is definitely more harmful than taking heroin, yet we don't forbid building sixth floors.” I think Plath would have asked him at what number of stories does heroin become worse than jumping. She would have had fun writing about that I think.

Sam helped me find a vein and the needle slid under my skin, the prick didn’t even register. I felt no physical pain anymore. The numbness had spread to my brain, not chemically, but emotionally. 

The first word I uttered to Gwen was when she was just about to start a new chapter of that painful and sad novel. I started a new chapter with her and by the time the book ended, nothing was left but a letter from the author. A letter from the author for the book of my life should have been something I put a lot of thought into. But typically that happens on a deathbed, and the bed I was laying on was made of cardboard and broken meth pipes.

I opened the notes app on my phone and I was tempted to write *Fuck You Gwen*, but she wouldn’t have even cared. I just typed out a short will, leaving everything to Sam, mentioning that he was a friend of mine. I typed some identifying information and tried my best to make it so that the police would know it wasn’t foul play. He deserved a better life, I hoped he would go to rehab or something, turn his life around and not turn out like me.

With no affairs left to take care of, I eased the plunger of the syringe towards my vein. The amber shaded liquid disappeared into my arm, making my blood a smoothie of cocaine, alcohol, and heroin. I immediately felt the smooth and reassuring hand of Lady Heroin, she caressed me and told me that all was well with the world. I had nothing to worry about anymore, I had no problems waiting for me when I came back. Where I was going there were no earthly problems. I closed my eyes and reality seemed to “melt” away, the sensations that I normally experience were entirely foreign. Everything was deeper and thoughts and feelings *floated* through my brain as it separated from my body, and soon my body separated from the ground. I visualized myself laying on top of a cloud, drifting by like I was on a lazy river through heaven. The cloud ascended higher and higher until the sky turning into a blinding white, I was entering purgatory. The last thing my consciousness created was a voice that uttered the last line of that Dickens’ novel that reminded me I was in “the worst of times.”

I ruined it with a girl, I started talking to this girl last Thursday and made the fatal mistake of asking her if she liked me on Saturday despite only talking to her for like 3 days, I told my friends which was a huge mistake because they ran their mouths to her because they were ‘curious’, and since I couldn’t keep my mouth shut I told people that we were talking and she told me that we were just friends and that I shouldn’t be telling everyone about stuff like that. Now I know she don’t like me at all because she got dry. I fuck everything up. All because I constantly fucking confuse friendliness for flirting, I thought since we slept on the phone together on Saturday that she liked me. I hate myself so much.

Also yesterday my friends played a prank on me where they acted like they were her ex and told me not to touch her, and I confronted her ex and asked if it was him and he said no, later I got a text from the same number asking why I didn’t fight him, and I told my friend how he is different in text so he must be a pussy. This “friend” decided to tell me to “stop talking shit” and “chill out” because they told me it was just a prank” earlier and that I “need to listen”. They never fucking told me it was a FUCKING PRANK. Thanks to these dumb bitches as-well as my friend because on Saturday I told him how I sort of liked her and he pressured me into telling her that I liked her, now she doesn’t like me at all. She was perfect too. I fucking hate everyone.

I fucking hate myself I’m all I had to do was keep my mouth shut but no I betrayed her trust by telling everyone that we were talking

1408,o5cyyb,"Looking into possibly being a roommate with someone that has a BP Dx, any insight is appreciated.","Greetings everyone, 

I’m 19M and finally about to move near campus to attend college (I already finished one year, which I spent attending from home bc covid). I’m not diagnosed Bipolar, but I am NeuroDivergent in several ways. My knowledge regarding anything related to being Bipolar is sort of limited, but I’m extremely open minded and accepting. I might have royally fcked up wording, because I haven’t been around this community before, so please do correct me if you feel my wording is insulting (or even just incorrect for that matter).

It’s time for me to find a roommate (I’ll have a separate room, but will be living in the same apt.), and a wonderful gal (19F) I met at freshman orientation contacted me the other day! I’m quite excited because I’m pretty sure living with them would be great, but there are also some things that I do feel might be important to consider. Keep in mind, while I have met them in person (spent 4-6 straight hours in person with them, and I find we have a lot in common) and have been in several classes with them (we share the same major, which is in the medical field), I’m sure there is much that I don’t know about them.

At orientation, we discussed NeuroDiversity quite a bit and we talked about our different dx’s. They disclosed that they have a Bipolar diagnosis (not sure about specifics), and they have a support/service dog to help alert/ground them when they’re in a manic/stressful state (or something like that, but it’s really difficult to remember).

While I’m very accepting of ND’s, especially because I’m ND myself, I do find importance in having a basic understanding of someone before I make the important/large decision of living with them, or at this point like looking further into it.

I’m genuinely trying to not come off as a shit human being, as I want to ask relevant things in a sensitive/appropriate way that won’t A. trigger them and B. make them feel “less” for being Bipolar. Would it be appropriate for me to ask them the following?:

1. How does being Bipolar influence your life, and how do you predict it will influence you during this in-person school year?
2. How often do you experience manic episodes or other altered states which deviate from what you consider your “balanced” state?
3. Would you need any supports? How could someone, as a roommate, support/accommodate you? 

Are there any other questions I should ask?

Should I or should I not mention it to my parents? (They’re kind people, but I fear that they’re old and may come from a generation that stigmatizes anyone dx’d Bipolar. Maybe they wouldn’t, but I don’t know)

Is there anything that would be beneficial for me to know?

Am I overthinking this??

I’ve taken a psych course & do love to read about psych & neurology, like a lot (but at the same time I recognize that neurodivergence can influence people in vastly different ways, even if they have the same Dx, so textbook knowledge may not always be accurate (which is also why I’ve come to ask this community)). 

I appreciate anyone that’s read this far, even if you find you don’t have the energy to respond. Any comments, suggestions, or criticism, would be duly appreciated, as is your time.",1,0

Like right now, I know it's symptom to believe you're not bipolar when you are, but There's a MASSIVE chance I'm lying to myself and pretending to mimic those symptoms

My meds are placebos. I know they are. I've been given them so they can monitor me and prove that I'm lying to myself. I know that one day I'll show up to an appointment and they'll confront me about it and tell me that I'm not actually taking the medication they're saying I am

Even if I am, I don't think I should continue taking them. If they are what they say they are, I don't think that's healthy for me. If I'm not actually mentally ill, I'm assuming that could cause damage to my health and I don't need that 

I'm completely convinced that it's the truth. My boyfriend is saying I'm unstable but I know I'm not. I'm not unstable I'm just having a break of truth and seeing past my lies of it. Soon I'll fully uncover all of it and I'll prove to him that I'm telling the truth",0,0

Being Bipolar messes with my social skills BIG time. I can't make any friends because of it. Especially in my depressive phases. So it gives me social anxiety and it prevents me from doing anything social.

However, I also count being gay as being a comorbidity, because it's just a hugely hugely negative thing that prevents me from living a normal life. It cuts off communication from society at large I think.

Also, being Christian is also a comorbidity to me, because here in California it has prevented me from blending in with normal society. It's hecka secular and antiChristian here. I've lost many friends and have been shunned just because I am Christian.

Lastly, I am big time overweight and morbidly obese.

I don't know what I did in order to hit the genetic jackpot LOL with all of these ""disorders"" but my medication causes me to gain weight, so I also suffer from physical health problems on top of everything else.

1442,ddmdj2,Manic - My experience with Omega Fish Oil,"I'm here after about a year I created a post asking if Omega-3 fish oil really helped mainly with manic episodes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/9clyxg/omega3\_fish\_oil\_for\_bipolar\_maniac/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/9clyxg/omega3_fish_oil_for_bipolar_maniac/)

&#x200B;

My mom has had bipolar since her mid 30s. About a year ago her mental state was in real bad shape, her medication was not working with her. She used to recover for a while and after a week or 2 and she would get another severe manic episode which lasted 1 week while on medication. She used to take Olaweb 2.5 and Depakote 250mg.

&#x200B;

Medication was no help so I decided to do some research and found out about Omega-3 fish oils. I did more research about it and it was really helping bipolar patients with depression. I couldn't find any information on how it affected bipolar patients with manic.  So I though and gave it a try.

&#x200B;

I need to find out the correct dosage and which fish oil would be suitable for bipolar manic patients.  After a few hours of research I found this [page](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/mood-stabilizers/omega-3-fatty-acids/) deep somewhere in Google.  The correct dosage amount is  >1000mg EPA everyday.

&#x200B;

I bought some fish oil from Ebay-Amazn and began giving it to her.

&#x200B;

After I started giving her fish oils everyday, after a  months her episodes became less frequent. From every 2-4 weeks it went to 5-6 weeks, then a month later 6-7 weeks and so on. To see results it took a while and I'm happy that it was working. Her episode severity also kept going down. I gave her fish oils only when she was not on her episode. I used give her her regular medication with fish oil when she had her episode.

&#x200B;

Today, it has been a year and her last episode was 3-4 months ago(not severe at all!). This time her episodes are very easy to control and she recovers within 1-2 days(before it took 1 week) with her regular medications.",2,0

TLDR: Took about 12 mg of MDMA and probably have bipolar III. Wondering if I should expect some depressive symptoms from the comedown.

I think I am on the Bipolar III/cyclothymia spectrum though the diagnosis isn't final (my father has bipolar I and my current psychologist thinks I have symptoms of bipolar). It's definitely not strong, I spent 4 years without a depression (aside from isolated days when I'm ridiculously emotional for no reason). Had my last depression last winter and it lasted about 2 months. Took Prozac for about 3. Manic periods never lasted more than a week or so and I can usually notice and manage the symptoms well, so usually it just leads to some insomnia and a lot of creativity, higher libido and social energy (not normal for me, I'm quite introverted).

Two nights ago I took a small dose of MDMA with a fuckbuddy (I think it was 12mg but too be honest I'm confused on how much, I just know it wasn't a lot, just enough to get a bit high). It definitely had an effect. I was in a very good mood and sounds were a little different, my pupils were huge, etc. I'm very sensitive to drugs (I get high from two puffs and very tipsy from a glass of wine) and it was my first time trying it. Today I feel very energetic (helps that I drank two cups of coffee which I probably shouldn't have), my libido is very high, I'm having trouble concentrating and I've written two poems already which is a lot for me. It probably adds to the mania that I spent the week with a lot of different people and had a lot of sex. Over-stimulation usually leads to mania for me.

So what I am wondering is if I should be scared about the comedown from the drug and expect depressive symptoms. I'm thinking because I took a small dose it shouldn't be too bad but I hope I can hear some stories/advice. Thanks!

&#x200B;

This whole ordeal started on December 31st, which is already my least favorite day of the year for reasons that I will explain. That also means that I've been seriously struggling for all of 2019. So, on 12/31 of last year, I was piss-drunk, as is customary for me at NYE, and I forgot to take my medications. I'd been heavily medicated for five years, and had suffered some pretty significant side effects, including 80 lbs of weight gain and excessive grogginess and hypersomnia (I was sleeping 12 hours a night, which made life very difficult). I had been on Prozac since I was 13, and prior to 12/31 I had been on Zyprexa, Prozac, Tegretol, and Keppra. I've been on other drugs over the years, but those were my regimen at the time. My diagnoses are Bipolar II and OCD, so that drug regimen is a little inappropriate (I learned later), but I trusted my psych NP, so I did as I was told.

&#x200B;

\[In retrospect, I maybe should have been suspicious of her knowledge of BD bc every time I reported a side effect, she added a new drug instead of changing the one causing the symptom, until I was on Zyprexa, Prozac, Topomax, and Welbutrin. Now, Welbutrin lowers the seizure threshold and Topomax treats seizures, which means when I asked her to take me off Topomax bc it was making me stupid, and she did, but left me on a v high dose of Welbutrin, I had a grand mal seizure. That was back in September, and the ER doctors did some tests and sent me home bc my scans were normal. Less than a month later, I had another seizure and another $1000 ambulance ride, and this time they told me to go off Welbutrin and take some Keppra, and I complied. My neurologist agreed to this assessment later, and he and my psych NP decided to add in Tegretol (a mood stabilizer). So, then I was on an antipsychotic, a mood stabilizer, an SSRI, and an anticonvulsant. The side effects were brutal, probably bc that's a terrible combo for BD2.\]

&#x200B;

So, on NYE I was drunk and I forgot to take my medication. That next morning, I was terribly hungover and in my sleep I had somehow pinched a nerve, so I was in excruciating pain. I spent two days sleeping nearly constantly, and gobbling hydrocodone when I was conscious so that I could fall back asleep. By Jan 1, I was already withdrawing from the longer-acting of my drugs, and I couldn't keep anything down (or brush my teeth) bc I couldn't stop vomiting. That meant I didn't take my meds for several more days. I figure now that I was probably detoxing from (accidentally) quitting those drugs cold turkey, but at the time, I was sure I had the flu. By the 10th, the worst of it was over and I thought I was finally over the ""flu,"" so I started taking my medication again (without consulting my psych). This is just the first of many mistakes I've made this year.

&#x200B;

On Jan 15th, I flew south to spend 16 days with my v conservative, v traditional family. I, being a proper northerner, am a democratic socialist with tattoos and facial piercings and I wear Birkenstocks with yoga socks in January. This is important background info bc you'll understand why I'm the black sheep of the family. Most of that side of the family never went to college, and I just finished my BA in English literature, which they don't understand bc I didn't actually learn how to *do* anything. They all work blue collar jobs, which is perfectly respectable, but admittedly different from the path I was privileged enough to take. So, I was already unsure that I wanted to continue taking my medications bc I had felt very clear, mentally, and other symptoms such as my compulsive binge eating had gone away during the 10 days I was unmedicated at the start of the month...

sidebar: I'll add now that that was the first time in my decade-long career of taking various psych meds that I'd ever taken myself off my meds without consulting anyone, but I was fed up with my psych's poor management of my regimen. She attributed all of my problems and side effects to lack of self discipline, like telling me to attend Food Addicts Anonymous instead of removing the drug that was causing my compulsion to eat when I wasn't hungry; or like attributing my crippling hypersomnia to lack of ambition rather than the two (2) antidepressants and the atypical antipsychotic I was on; that sort of thing.

So, it was not difficult for my family, which is generally anti-prescription (oh and they're connoisseurs of toxic positivity), to talk me into going off my meds. Now, I'm not disputing the fact that it was ultimately my decision to take myself off my meds, but I also know that I am awfully malleable when I'm in a vulnerable emotional position, and I am generally wont to listen to ppl I perceive as trustworthy and/or able to back up my preconceived notions. But in any event, I went off my meds around Jan 21st. On Jan 29th, I called my psych's cell phone on her day off and confessed what I'd done, and how I was detoxing, and I'd gone off Zyprexa, but I'd left myself on Prozac, and basically what did she want me to do? She told me to stay on Prozac, and come see her after I got back on Feb 1st. I did this, though I now know that Prozac by itself can trigger a full-blown manic episode in someone with Bipolar II Disorder, which, if you'll recall, is me. The most hedonistic month of my life ensued.

I had a really awful yeast infection for the first full week of February, but I got myself off mentally by giving my husband very enthusiastic oral sex. I had watched some such porn, got myself nice and baked, and then went about it in an entirely new fashion, with far more emphasis on teasing, and a fair amount of kissing, licking, and ball-squeezing. He didn't seem to mind at all, maybe bc I was showing him a more extroverted side of myself and that excited him, or maybe bc I was sexually excited about him again; it probably doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

Around the 11th, I was feeling really horny and I was (quel surprise) completely baked, so I decided to message my high school boyfriend, who had ripped my heart out when I was 16, which my husband then eventually mended a year later. P, we'll call him, facilitated my introduction to sexuality. I was in the sixth grade when I met P. We were in the same school play and we'd become friends. He was eccentric, to say the least, even for the north. We were 12 and he wore suits to school, which I thought was adorable. I've known for years he was/is really a douchebag, but at the time I was impressed by his knowledge of Beatles music and anime. Our relationship was always incredibly volatile--lots of fighting and disparaging remarks--but at the time I thought that was normal bc that's how my parents had been. Obviously it wasn't as damaging as an adult argument can be, but for a 12 yr old it was always p intense.

&#x200B;

I do remember the first time I ever felt physical arousal was while talking to P on IM. He told me I was beautiful, and I felt a sharp pang in my clitoris. As we grew up, he always had a girlfriend, and my friends and I regularly heard stories about his escapades. Some of my friends even participated in the stories. Tbh I'm not entirely sure why he wasn't an incel bc he was a total nerd and/or twat, but he was decent looking, p popular in our circles, and very sexual. It was probably an American Pie Band Camp kind of thing. We were theatre geeks, and we all hooked up with each other.

&#x200B;

I wasn't involved in his sexploration until I was in 8th grade and he was a freshman in HS. We both did theatre, which was how we had met two-point-five years prior, and I had gone to his show the previous month, so he came to mine in May of that year. He worked the curtain, and we exchanged flirty glances the whole night. When we were cleaning up the lunchroom (remember, I was still in middle school, so our school plays were performed on the cafeteria stage), we walked past the bandroom and he pulled me into the alcove with the instrument lockers and we made out. I pinned him against a tuba locker and stuck my tongue down his throat, which other boys had liked, but he didn't. Afterward, he told me I was ""too enthusiastic."" We went on one date, and then we didn't talk again seriously until I was a sophomore in HS. In the interim, I had several boyfriends, but no one serious. I had not yet been in love.

&#x200B;

I had a brief emotional affair with a 22 year old college man when I was 14. I realize now how inappropriate that was, but at the time I was just thrilled to receive the attention.

D fixed my car and we went on dates and made out, but I was never serious about him. He told me last year he was in love with me for years, but I honestly never knew.

T left his girlfriend of 2 years so he could ask me out when I was a freshman and he was a senior at a different HS. We dated three separate times over 3 years, and he ended up falling in love with me, too, but he didn't tell me that until years later, after I was engaged. He was the first man who ever touched my vulva, and he fingered me under my red sundress in a park in broad daylight in the middle of summer with lots of people around. This revealed my penchant for exhibitionism, but that is a story for another day. He won't talk to me to this day bc I was his first love and his first heartbreak.

\[I kissed, in total, before I met my husband, 47 people. This included boys and girls; friends and boyfriends and friends' boyfriends and girlfriends; and even my stupid-hot stepsister. I was a foreplay nymphomaniac.\]

&#x200B;

Then there was the captain of the football team, with whom I had a very serious--and often risque--flirtation. He wanted to date me, but my heart belonged to P, and drama ensued.

I'll explain that in a moment, but first I have to disclose something: I had an abusive childhood, and I had been medicated for depression since age 13 (diagnosed at 8 yrs old), so I was mentally unstable already, but I became hypersexual during puberty when I discovered the intoxicating sexual high of having a boy/man wrapped around your finger. I had to grow up quickly, and though I was only a young teenager, I was very sexual. This, coupled with p intense features (square jaw, high cheekbones, and chin-length raven hair) got me p much anything I wanted. I've gained 80 lbs since then, so I am not nearly as attractive, but trust me when I say I was desirable. I looked legal, but around town my nickname was ""jailbait."" I only remember 1 man ever rejecting me, and it was bc he didn't feel the age gap between a 13 year old girl and a 19 yr old man(let?). At the time, I was disappointed, but I'm now grateful that he didn't take advantage of me like so many boys and men wanted to and/or did. I acknowledge my part in my actions, but it's not like I was making out with brick walls; these were 19 yr old boys sending me dick pics when I was 13. They were not without fault, regardless of whether or not I was a cocktease.

So, the school quarterback/football captain (R) was in my sophomore year math class, as was P. The first day of sophomore year, I walked into first period and P was sitting by the door. R was at a table in the middle of the classroom, but we hadn't yet met. I sat next to P, and that was my seat for the next four months, during which time we secretly dated.

One day in mid-September, P called me and we laughed about our shenanigans with friends in middle school and reminisced about how crazy we'd been for each other, and how disappointed we were that we had never made it past first base. By then, I'd been masturbated by T, but I'd never experienced an orgasm with another person (though my personal record was then 9 consecutive orgasms, at the hands of my vibrator, of course). I figured with how skilled P was with arousing me in conversation, he'd be decent in the shee--oh, well, we did it in a forest, not in a bed, as we were teenagers and had to at least attempt to hide the fact that we were sexually active, though I'm sure our parents knew what we were doing.

&#x200B;

We started by meeting for coffee and ended up making out behind the parking lot. Another time, we walked to the forest behind my neighborhood and kissed, topless, on a low-sitting tree, with me on his lap. He was the first person to have seen my breasts (girlfriends had, but not romantically) and I asked him to bite me; softly, at first, but then the force increased. I was in Heaven, moaning so loudly a man walking his dog nearby came to investigate and we had to hide. P started with biting my nipples, but I ultimately ended up with bruises all over my torso, and I proudly wore turtlenecks for two weeks, enjoying my secret. I dropped suggestive hints and flirted with him in front of our friends, but we hadn't told any of them what we were doing. Then, he started telling me he loved me, and I was in paradise. I loved him, too. I realized I really did; I was in love with him. It confused me when I first realized how I felt, but after saying it in my head three times ... ""I am in love with P"" x 3 ... it felt real in that way that painfully true statements often do.

I ramped things up by inviting P over to my house while I was home alone. I had just had my wisdom teeth removed and I was high on hydrocodone, so we couldn't swap spit, but we spooned while watching TV for three or so hours, his cock hard in my backside the entire time. I pressed backward intermittently, rubbing my butt into his crotch. Then, I'd give him 15 minutes to concentrate on the series, and then I'd surprise him again. I got off on knowing how much he wanted me, and he couldn't have anything.

&#x200B;

When my mouth healed, we met again, back in the forest. I was a bit melodramatic, so that night I was wearing some of my black lace lingerie under my pajamas (which happened to be black satin, but that wasn't intentional) bc I was feeling myself that night. He texted me and said he was outside and told me to meet him and we'd go to the forest, so I wrapped myself in a blanket and grabbed my only boots, which had a 5 inch heel (btw, that's not generally good for tramping through the forest without a trail). I was an embarrassingly over-the-top teenager tbh.

&#x200B;

It was 10 o'clock in late November, so it was pitch black outside. He led me by the hand through the forest and we laid down my blanket in a bare patch. We sat down, and immediately commenced the snogfest. I pulled off his coat and his shirt so that I could kiss his chest, which was unimpressive, but I was in love. We kissed that way for a bit, and then he flipped me onto my back and hovered over me before pulling off my pajama bottoms. He pulled up my top so that he could kiss my mons, above the line of my thong. This was a completely new experience, so I was already bucking my hips. He pulled off my panties and kissed my clitoris. He licked in varying settings for maybe 10 minutes before I got bored and took back control. He did not give me an orgasm, but I wouldn't expect to cum from my first experience with oral sex. I was still figuring out what turned me on at that age, and I later realized that I can only orgasm if my legs are spread very widely. Also, my pelvic floor muscles have to be clenched, preferably around a dick, but it's not entirely necessary. We kissed and held each other for a while, but we eventually gave up and P walked me home.

&#x200B;

We met one more night that week, and we French kissed in the backseat of my car, parked on my street. We listened to jazz and he fixed my stereo. I felt his cock through his underwear, but I was too afraid to do anything with it, so I mumbled an excuse, and didn't press the issue. He left and I went to bed unsatisfied.

&#x200B;

The next morning, I wore a long black vintage satin dress, with black pumps, a knotted string of pearls, a cat eye and red lipstick. I also curled my short hair, so in all I looked a lil like a flapper. R went crazy. I sat on his desk before class, as I had several times before, but this time I sat right above his lap, and looked him straight in the eye, fluttering my eyelashes. I pulled out all the stops in a misguided attempt to make P jealous, as I felt like things were sizzling out and I needed to regain his attention. Unfortunately, R's girlfriend witnessed our flirtation, and that caused problems for him, but I try to remember that he was an enthusiastic participant, so I can't be blamed for everything.

&#x200B;

As you've probably guessed, it backfired, and P essentially ghosted me, but like 2011 style, which meant ignoring my google chats and text messages. I moved away later that year bc of family issues, but I was so glad to be away from that whole situation. After he broke it off with me, he told me he had never loved me, and essentially that he had used me to play with. He then told all of our mutual friends that I had begged him for a purely physical relationship, and then became obsessed with him, and when he broke it off, I started stalking him... they all stopped talking to me. It was probably the loneliest time in my life; I had gone from being one of the ""popular kids"" in middle school to having 3 friends all because (as I saw it) of this jackass. I felt utterly defeated. When I moved away, I tried to forget about him, and I met my husband and moved on, but obviously I didn't forget about him, bc I messaged him on February 11th.

1461,aby6gm,The blind leading the blind,"I guess this is my first and last post of 2019 on reddit in the community. I am sure that there are some productive and positive  people with bipolar out there and on here. Before the end of 2018 I didn't want to believe anything was wrong with me. I didn't want to take the label, I wanted to be the old me. I didnt want to talk about mental illness, I didn't want to believe something so intangible can be real but it is. 
I barely made it to my 27 birthday, and on the way there I noticed how unconscious I've been my whole adult life. Nothing mattered to me I never really had a sense of family leaving home at 17 being abused physical and emotionally unstable trying to hide it all in a suit and tie and just grind. Dropping out of college, alienating great friends, believe it was me against the world led that to my reality because now it is. 
I've assassinated my character and it's the hardest thing I see for me to rebuild what took me 27 years to establish. I have no idea where to start, maybe I do but my shame and fear is crippling.  

But through all this I've kept a positive attitude going in and out of depression,manic episodes filled with rage. Through all this I know if I wake up I have to make the most of every single day as conscientious as possible. 

In 2019, not that the year matters but today, tomorrow and the tomorrows after that, I'll make sure that. I am here, present and now.

Reading the stories on here have made me notice. That while we are all a victim of something or someone that mentality isn't going to get you anywhere besides a pity part with others. I hope you all stay strong, stay balanced, stay positive and stay blessed. 

""Everywhere I go there I am"" - we are our own enemy, use the internet wise and be careful with what you feed your mind.

1483,g82it9,Kanye West is my bipolar role model,"Before you all say 'but he isn't on his meds and that's dangerous' I agree with you, but he has literally said he doesn't think meds work for him, but he doesn't encourage others to go off them because it isn't right for everyone. And he has his own way of dealing with shit and I'll accept it, but that doesn't mean I'll do it. Also, lets be honest most of us have probably gone off meds, I sure have, its gone batshit wild, but I've done it and can understand why he does.

&#x200B;

The reason why he's my role model is because he embraces his illness, and is proud of it. Which I dont always feel myself, but that's damn respectable and I wish I was as proud of having this shitstorm like he is and I can only aspire to think like that. He is also a genius and if you've listened to his music its hard to deny, and it inspires me that even someone with this disorder can achieve and create what he's created. He gives me hope.

I'll admit Kanye isn't perfect but I respect him and how he treats his disorder.

I'm writing a story featuring a character with Bipolar type 1. I take a lot of care and caution when trying to portray any type of illness/disorder or neurodiversity since I am someone who had their own issues and knows the sting of being poorly represented.

I've had friends with Bipolar (unfortunately they aren't in my life anymore.) And can speak from that perspective (As an outsider looking in of course.) but that also means I can't ask anybody about certain aspects.

So if it's not too offensive I'd like to ask some questions for the character so I can represent him the best I know-how.

A lot of my questions are to do with medication experiences.

How well do medications actually manage manic/depressive episodes?  Are they still experienced to a lower degree or are they averted almost entirely?

What is medication like generally? I hear it's hard to stick to and can cause side effects like weight gain and emotional numbness, is this common?

Is it possible to tell when a manic episode is coming? I've heard that there are symptoms like a higher sex drive, and a 'lightning under the skin' feeling. Is this common? Are there other factors to tell? I imagine it's not something you can check on a calendar, but is there a 'routine' Bipolar can fall into? (Probably not but I thought I'd ask.)

Please let me know misconceptions about Bipolar so that I can triple-check my character. Are there any sources references you'd recommend? How about fictional characters that you feel do a good job of representing you?

I'm happy to ask any questions about the character if it helps :)

Edit:

For clarification, I can assure you I am not a neurotypical writer trying to make bank. I have diagnosed OCD with an emphasis on the 'O' and highly probable ADHD (Which is currently being diagnosed.) As well as other issues that are less pertinent to this example. It's a story highlighting the dangers of ignored/neglected mental illnesses and disorders while simultaneously drawing attention to horrible ""mental health support"" agencies.

I also can assure you that the story never takes place with the Bipolar character's POV. His entire arc focusing on his bipolar is through his friend witnessing it (Which is someone whose shoes I have been in.) I'd never feel comfortable writing from a perspective I can't see myself in/haven't experienced, especially if it's something so personal as a mental illness.",10,0

if you function at 70% this can add another 20%, another thing, this is probabily won't work if you're rich and 50bucks are nothing for you and you're not scared to lose it

I recently ended up in the hospital for another inpatient treatment and it was a terrible experience. After I got out I was determined to work hard to reduce my episodes. I don’t want to end up suicidal again. I’m taking my meds every day because before I was skipping 3 times a week so I could drink and be out with my friends.

However, I’m struggling because it feels like this disease takes away everything that made life feel more full.

Things like going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day feels stifling to my social life. I know it’s so important but I hate missing out on time with my friends because their activities all take place later in the evening when I need to sleep.

I’m completely sober and have been for 24 days but I miss going out with friends and having fun. I used to go out to raves in my early twenties (and yes, I did recreational drugs and drank). I never overdid the recreational stuff but totally abused alcohol. I miss taking LSD or mushrooms with my friends or by myself and having my whole attitude about life shifted afterwards for the positive, however I know that these activities lead to episodes.

I am stopping caffeine and I completely stopped smoking weed which was my primary way of relaxing after work. I miss weed especially but I’m trying to stay strong and stay stable.

I feel like a wet blanket and a child. I hate that I can’t do things late at night anymore, I hate that my medication means I cannot go out with friends and party with them. I hate that certain friends never hang out with me anymore because it’s boring compared to their other friends and activities.

I feel like people take for granted the freedom they have in the every day lives and I’m becoming more and more resentful and stuck in this depressive episode because it feels like everything is being taken from me.

I’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do. I want to do the things that help me control my illness but I feel like my life has been stolen and it’s not worth living if I have to live like a child with a bedtime and dietary restrictions and without the spontaneity that I used to have in my life.

It’s consuming my entire life.,"I used to edate, and 4 years ago i had this girlfriend from across the country. This girl from her city messaged me, and me becoming friends with her/talking to her ended our relationship, and my ex proceeded to ruin her reputation and have her branded as a manipulator and liar from everyone in their city. 

This girl and I have been talking on and off ever since. Recently after we hadn’t talked for a bit, she messaged me from a burner number pretending to be a complete stranger and tricked me into reaching out to her again. 

Our most recent time talking ended horribly with lots of cussing out and insults, as they usually do. Our friendship was always very toxic as we both have BPD and i have bipolar. 

She’s always wanted to meet in person very bad and has always gotten really angry when I didnt want to/couldn’t. This last time we talked I gave her my address to mail me something. 

After that during a fight she revealed to me that she has known all of my online accounts that ive never told anybody about and has been stalking my online activity for several years. 

I cusse her out and told her that this was the last straw and that i never want to speak to her again. Since then she has tried to contact me 4 times and i have told her to go fuck herself each time. 

She scares me, she openly cheats on her bf and unapologetically lies and uses people a lot. I think she’s really mad at me for being mean to her and making people she knows irl not like her. 

And now she has my address. I am so constantly scared 24/7 that out of nowhere im gonna see her or one of her goons with a weapon and get shot or stabbed.

i need to move but i cant for a few months because of money. I’m scared to sleep, leave the house or go into my house. 

Shes never threatened me befor but has hinted at liking violence a lot. 

Am i being crazy? I feel like the only thing that can stop this crippling paranoia is moving somewhere she doesnt have the address.

TL;DR I have pissed off this one girl from thousands of miles away a LOT over the years and now she has my address and I am completely consumed by the fear that she will kill me",0,0
1507,z5k4dq,I wish I was hypersexual again :(,"I wish I was hypersexual again, when I was with my ex I my bipolar wasn’t managed and I was manic most of the time. We had sex every time we hung out and it was good hard sex.

It’s like once or twice a month that I’m in the mood and ready for sex. I miss what I had with my ex, the fact that we could just have sex whenever and I was always in the mood.

1519,x4b1zk,A change of perspective (YOU REALLY WANNA READ THIS O:) ),"Hello hello community,

How are we doing today !

I have been reading some of the posts in this community every now and then, and every time, I feel I can relate to a part of what you guys say. After all, mental health issues are not a straight forward process, it's as complex as it can get.

However, I am not here to vent and share negative vibes, nor I am here to tell you ""think positive"", cause you know, I am not stupid XDDD.

Anyways, I wanna share with you a bit of what I have been through and the change of perspective that I reached, and I am pretty sure this will only boost your energy even a little, no drawbacks I promise :D.

So, I am 25 yo, developed mental health issues bla bla bla, anxiety bla bla, panic bla bla. A lot of labels from different specialists, but to be honest, it was not as bad as some people, I managed to graduate, keep my relationships, etc etc.

What I want to talk to you about, is the following, A couple of months ago, I had what some call the dark night of the soul, you know, when you feel like you hit rock bottom, and that's it for you, (not necessarily suicidal) but you know, you kinda give up and feel that the world is being unfair.

At some point during that night, I had this thought ""I cannot live with myself anymore"", and it just got stack in my brain, I couldn't distract myself or change my thoughts, that was the theme of the night. And it made me sad, mad, frustrated and every other negative feelings on the scale of the energy levels.

However, being the skeptical overthinker that I am, a thought snapped through my brain,  ""I cannot live with myself anymore"" is more than it looks like, follow up with me, there is an ""I"" and a ""Myself"", that's literally 2 different people, the I cannot be with myself. THAT LITERALLY MADE ME THRILLED, like which one am I, it feels like there is this neutral creature ""I"", and I think that is what defines me, not the myself.

I found me a distraction to think about that night, and this time, it felt like a healthy distraction, because what I am doing here, is finding my true self. Now, I kept thinking, the reason that I am feeling this way, apart from physiological issues, is mainly external factors !!! (relationships, work, childhood issues, unresolved problems, suppressed / repressed / denied feelings), we all know that that's the real cause of this misery, but you kinda can't do that much about it.

Then I started thinking, who should be responsible of MY feelings, me or external factors ? they are MY feelings, I mean imagine you are having a coffee in a coffee shop chilling, and a random dude walks by and says ""hey, feel sad now"", that's bizarre right? are you really gonna feel sad over that ? hell no! you will probably through that cup of coffee on his face xDDD.

Now, make the analogy, I should be the one responsible of how I feel, I mean it's true that our bodies are stuck with multiple messed up issues, but try this for instance, a very very simple technique that I just want to put here so you can start questioning things. So, Close your eyes, and stop your brain from working, literally do not think about the past nor the future, stop that narrator that never stops in your brain, you can do that, and just be still. You can focus on your breath if you want, that helps stopping the brain from working. Just stop it, imagine that your brain melted and it became a lake, and be still that's it, even for seconds. Well let me tell, you will feel so peaceful, you shut down the engine ! you are just in the moment, not in the past, not in the future, this exact moment. Surrender your body, WHATEVER you are feeling, as bad as it may seem, as frustrating as it is, as painful as it is, it's only there because you are resisting it. Resistance my friend is what causes pain, I mean, why don't you just surrender your body to the feeling !, I am scared ? screw it, I don't care that's my body go nuts, let the fear spread in your body, don't label it or anything, just let it run through with no resistance, and just stay still, no thinking. Guess what ?  that feeling will walk around, here and there, finds nothing and just leaves, and trust me it leaves once and for all, I don't mean it's over no, I mean what you just did is you permanently reduced the fear that is hidden in your self. Fear / Panic / Depression / Sadness and grief etc. they are all the same. I mean you have been resisting them for years, try something else for a change, let it go, you are not gonna die so just say ""then what ? "" 

Now, what can we do with this exploration ? well it's up to you my friend. Personally, after finding out that and trying it out, I decided to work on my true identity, it's not an obsession or a full time job lol, it's simple meditation, simple breathing, simple letting go and surrendering mechanisms. And mark my words, you will build a small base, you will boost your energy enough, so you can think straight and start improving and making the decisions that will make you be better.

I hope I am making sense and I am not blabbering xD,

Anyway, I hope this was even a bit helpful, but I am telling it cause I tried it myself, and I have been in deep shi\*.

Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss this matter, it always helps to talk about stuff and can potentially help you :D

Be safe,

I love you all",0,0
1520,wfrdx6,"I may be insane, or perhaps just human, but....","... I will make this brief. It involves manic-episodes. I am sure it is the same for many, or even all, but my processing power seems to increase, beyond measure, while manic.

Question: Have any of you managed to figure out a way to induce manic? For me, after an episode, I am absolutely exhausted. But, during it, I am able to think much, much clearer. I have many interests, most of them involve our psychology. Having been through so much, nearly taking my own life, and having to deal with the loss of so many loved ones, many to suicide, I am determined to learn how to , again, induce this state of ""higher-functioning"", in order to gather my thoughts about this ""problem"" we all share. I am tired of feeling like shit, unable to gather myself long enough to make sense of the my thoughts. I am no long depressed, but the fading of it was , I believe, due to the fact everyone I once counted on , shit all over me. Im not here for a pity-party. More than anything, it is absolutely wrecking me to know so many who suffer from past experiences, only to tell themselves they will ""get through it"", when all they do is ignore it. Most I know develop a heavy drug addiction, or bury themselves in work.

I'm not even sure if this was all constructed correctly, but I feel that my pain would be alleviated if I were to be able to ""slip a switch"", so that I can push my mind to work this out. The guilt I feel is horrifying. What I feel, mostly, is numb, but it pales in comparison to the guilt of even the slightest possibility that something could be done.

Appreciate you for reading, if you did. Even if you do not respond, consider it. If you feel I am just insane, that's also acceptable. I want complete honesty here.",0,0

1523,w23l9o,I made the biggest mistake and posted to a popular board...,"Fuck y'all. I'm so fucking stupid. Still feeling the same I did weeks ago. I'm all over the place. I am seeing doctors though. But I send one fucking message to an ex because I was seriously just talking about him on a trip with friends, I was glad he was doing well, and him and his wife were cute and that's it. I didn't think anything else. And the wife just came out and ripped me apart. I don't wanna go into it all but it was some god awful things that I would never ever say to a person I don't know or to a person who my husband participated in acts I'm disgusted with the messager over.

The things she said and called me where huge triggers. For my addictions and it will just debilitate me.

They blasted my shit on Facebook so I raged and posted hers on Reddit. I'm stupid.

I'm not on the spectrum. But everyone kept asking me what the fuck was I thinking and the wife may have been psycho but I was wrong and I really did not see anything wrong with it. I thought it was just a nice message. It would've made me feel good to have gotten that message. Had my SO gotten that message, I wouldn't have thought they were putting moves on them. I would've have taken the message exactly how it read. And people were calling me a ho and making huge assumptions, calling me psycho and crazy and no matter how hard I defended myself and laid it out exactly how it was people just didn't care. 

It's my own shit really. I already had all this other stuff going on. So when I got the wife's words in my head, I shouldn't have jumped to reddit thinking people would understand where my heart was and that I am not and was not then this person that these people have made me feel.",0,0

1525,vr7ecr,"Help, I don't know how to grieve my BP ex-bf","Hey everyone,

I'm having a really tough time and I wonder if I might get some insight. It's been almost 5 years since I started dating this guy. He said he was ADHD. Within 3 months he was telling me we had to move in together because we couldn't be apart. Then he started telling me I was too busy for him (I was finishing my doctorate), and promptly broke up with me. 4 years later, I can't tell you how many times he's come back into my life and told me his whole world revolved around me, and that if I just did exactly what he needed me to do in the moment (focus on him over school, focus on him over my new job, eat exactly what he wanted me to eat, take care of myself exactly like he wanted to, followed him into every one of his emotional tunnels without fear, feeling hurt, wanting to be my own person) then we'd be perfect together.   
Well I didn't. I was sick of him trying to tell me who I was and what I needed to be doing as everyone else in my life thinks he's very controlling, and emotionally dangerous as he will build me up but devastate me in the same day. I saved a copy of a sound file once where he was screaming at me, and when I brought it up when he was in a good mood, he got super pissed that I had recorded him. I thought I was protecting myself to bring it to his attention about how cruel he could get. He stated it had nothing to do with the endless love he had for me in the moment and I was a fool to keep it.  
Last year he got me pregnant. While I said I wasn't ready because I felt we were in a really unstable place, he was soooo supportive. A week after he stood by me while we aborted, he was screaming at me and telling me I was always criticizing him and never supporting him. He left me in the middle of a park two hours from home. Again. Honestly after that I distanced myself from him. He scared the shit out of me. I wanted to grieve the abortion together and he basically threw me off and told me in so many terms if only ""I'd followed his emotions in the early days, we would have been successful and married and had many kids by then"". 

He recently re-entered my life after I gave myself some much space. He told me he never loved me at all, just an image of me, and said he wished my best friend should have been raped, as he blamed them for our most recent time apart. He was always trying to isolate me from my friends and family. And I fought like tooth and nail, sometime in deceit to keep people in my life so I could just have a general reality check when he told me one more time that I was a piece of s\*\*t. But oh wait, he really loved me. The weirdest part of all of this is, he has someone still standing by his side, not in a romantic capacity, but someone he romantically rejected who supports him through everything. He would mouth off about her and how boring and unattractive she is, and say that he wanted me. And on top of that, she has helped him to start a reasonably successful business where he is gaining a lot of connection with others, and notoriety which he loves. It feels good for anyone to be admired. And as he's always felt ""kept down by the man"", I think it's a type of self confidence he could never foster for himself and is giving him a new sense of respect for himself. I'm so happy for that.   
But I feel tossed out like another's days trash. I moved on from him sooo many times, but I abandoned over 8 relationships over the last 5 years whenever he came back. My mistake. But I could never truly commit to him, because honestly I would have had to become a shell of a person with everything he required me to do to stay standing next to him.

I'm human. I'm angry that I see him feeling supported as if it's a measure of what I got wrong, and that I deserve to be alone. And at the end of the day, none of that is true. I tried confronting him about his bad behavior in intimate relationships sooo many times. I tried to stand up for myself. And I moved on, soooo many times, to carve out a human space for myself that I am okay exactly who I am. My accomplishments are great for me. He always tells me he could have lifted me higher had I submitted to him. Every time he found out I did something like travel somewhere great, or made a life plan with someone else, he had to top me, and then tell me to my face that ""if I had just figured my shit out, then I could have been with him"". 

I feel so hurt from the first time in the bed room where he screamed at me for needing a hug or cuddle. To the many times he told me that his bad behavior was a reflection of my actions. I need to heal. I don't even know where to start. I had begun to, to make space, that none of his actions were my fault. Please help.",0,0

Written as a Bipolar/not as a Doctor or student. I am an amateur.

What do u think is the reason for Mental diseases?

I thought about it for a few years since the start of my Bipolar disorder.

Why do u get a mental Illness and why don't u get it within 1 year. On google it says

""**Fifty percent of mental illness begins by age 14, and three-quarters begin by age 24**. ""

What does this mean for Humans? Does it mean the reason for Mental Illness is other people, that make u feel how u feel?

If you're a kid and you go to your friend and his/her mom tells u that u are different doesn't it makes u feel bad and can be traumatic?

1537,u9pbdw,Do you ever feel like the pharm techs are like… “so how do you live your life???”,"To start, I probably should add that I have mild paranoia.

I’m going to the pharmacy shortly to pick up 7 medications. I’m pretty sure they’re all “for my brain”, one might be for my skin. It’s just such a weird feeling to have a stranger handing me so many meds that are psychotropic, yet I need to function. 

Can they comprehend? Do they know what these meds do? Are they aware of how serious my illness is based on the amount I come to get? 

Instead of being ashamed, I’m curious. They don’t know me by anything other than my bottles of pills, so I wonder what goes on in their mind. Anyone else feel the same?",0,0

1541,tvoqia,Feeling extremely violated and used,"So like my title reads, I am feeling extremely violated and used. I am a 28yF, I was diagnosed at 21. I started lithium, Epival, Seroquel, and a tranquilizer when originally diagnosed. I only stayed on that med combo for five months. For two years I was unmedicated and somewhat stable through exercise, routine. Then I was put on clonazepam, which has been okay. My Dr. Retired in august and his replacement hasn’t come from the other province because of the pandemic. I’ve been going to the ER for my meds. Fast forward to a few weeks ago: the dr wants me to come off a bit of the clonazepam (I take 1.5, so knock off .5) Then she added Lexapro. I knew it was a bad idea and she knew I was diagnosed bipolar and insisted it would be okay. It didn’t go well. I was yawning, and the yawns felt medicated, restless legs and then mania. My mania included over spending, binge drinking, promiscuous activities…. Paranoid features. I called the pharmacy and was told I could stop taking it. I stopped taking it and it swung me into a deeper mania. The point of this point was about a guy I met while manic (I’m still manic btw) Basically he found out about my condition quickly and started telling me to “take my pills”, go to sleep… eat… etc. etc. I was coming off a four day bender and he came over and slept with me while I was super vulnerable. I feel used now, even though that was last week. He knows I’m in rough shape and tell me what to do with myself but yet he will— send me pictures of alcoholic beverages, won’t come check on me unless he can sleep here…. Wants me to stay in a hotel room for four days with my dog so I can go away with him to work-even though I have my own career. Work is great, personal life not so great.

I got prescribed adderall and abilify but I have only started taking the adderall because I personally do not want to take a mood stabilizer. I took Lamictal for a week, had bad side effects. There’s other reasons why I don’t wanna take the abilify but don’t feel like getting into them rn. I’ve been taking 10 mg of adderall a day, 5 mg in morning and then 5 mg in afternoon (going to go up in dosage eventually). I’ve never taken a stimulant before so this is new to me. I haven’t really experienced bad side effects from the adderall and I think I notice a positive difference. I feel super happy today… but I don’t know if this is the adderall’s doing or a manic episode. The first day I took adderall I experienced a bit of euphoria for like 20 mins which I heard is normal. Anyways my question is this: is it a terrible idea to just keep taking the adderall and not the mood stabilizer? If I notice it’s making drastic differences to my mood I might start taking the abilify as well. But so far I have only experienced positive mood changes when I take the adderall.

1556,s0ngoz,Writing About From Hypomania to Mania,"Hello! I’m writing a character who is bi polar and I just want to know what I should/shouldn’t include. For more context the character is school aged (16) and she’s met a girl but I think at first the assumption is that its cliche love at first sight, when really this character is in hypomania. I’ve heard some bi polar people say that love can trigger hypo/mania and some say hypo/mania induces love (for as long as the mania lasts). 

So the character starts off in hypomania, and slowly she gets more paranoid/agitated (as she thinks she is being stalked/surveyed) and at the point in the story I’m at right now she is manic, made clear as she goes from not wanting to have sex as she wants it to be more special to just impulsively having sex because every day/moment/thing/one is so special

I’m struggling with how to write the development from hypo to mania. I’m trying to draw off of my own experiences (I have a few personality disorders, substance abuse issues and they have kicked around a bi polar diagnosis) of my high and low points, but it’s different, y’know? I can go from suicidal to loving everything in a day. So it’s hard for me to write more of a slow burn, hence why I’m posting this

So, basically, what do I include to show the mood has gone from hypo to mania? Do I amplify the hypo to a debilitating level, or is there symptoms that are more mania exclusive? For example this character would never drink or take drugs ever (in her right frame of mind), but in her mania she gets drunk on absinthe right away (please don’t do this, for many reasons)",0,0

That being said I want to get rid of this akithisia, so I can return to work, not making money is making me worse. What meds combos or meds can I ask for?

I can't go to work due to this akithasia, I've been off for a week and I have to make my last paycheck to be able to pay rent, really worried.

Edit: they ordered a gene mouth swab to see what meds react to me in what ways, but instead of waiting they just started prescribing me meds due to a maniccepisode I was in and I believe I'm out of it, I'm seriously against meds but I know bipolar patients should be taking them. But I really think I can do this with just therapy and finding ways to manage this better and identifying symptoms. I'm not suicidal and agreed if I were to be I would go to the hospital to get help. I really think the psychiatrist should be prescribing me meds as opposed to my physician, and I really think they should have waited for the gene swap.

This situation is getting worse. Yesterday she filled out an application for therapy. Great! Yesterday I had bought her a small bag with tissue paper that had her favorite candy and a $10 Apple Gift Card. She asked why I did it. I told her just to show I care. She then told me she doesn’t feel we are compatible and that I deserve someone who can love me how I need to be loved in my love language (intimacy) and she needs someone who can love her in her love language (acts of service)(Which I just tried with the bag..?).  She then explains to me she knows I care. Her mom, sister, and step father are all in shock and they don’t understand why she is thinking about divorce. We had been in contact yesterday so I called them to tell them she is still on the fence. They came over to talk to her. When they asked her why she is thinking of leaving she said because “He leaves his pants on the bathroom floor and doesn’t always clean up after himself”. I have been doing better as a while ago she told me it was pet peeve. BUT DIVORCE OVER THAT?  She is walking around like everything is normal. I am having a hard time acting like things are normal. I’m devastated and having trouble focusing on day to day tasks. 

Her plan: her plan is to get an appointment with the therapists and go to 2 therapy sessions alone. After 2 alone she wants us to go together. Keep in mind she just filled out the application so this could be months while I just continue to grieve. In the meantime through Thanksgiving etc she is fine and I’m supposed to not even show that I am upset. 

Everyone is telling me it is either her medication: Lamictal OR she is having an affair/has her eye on someone. The kicker to all of this? On vacation last weekend when I asked what was wrong she said it was with her Bipolar and she couldn’t explain to me what she does not even understand in her own head. I am giving her space and I’m not trying to do anything anymore to get her to snap out of it. I am just lost and devastated.

I was the last friend remaining but explained as gently as I could that as an abuse survivor, I can't keep allowing those actions to impact my own mental health. I've been blocked as a result.

We (friendship group) still all want to be there for him and support him but, honestly, have no idea where it goes from here.  We've all been blocked on socials and from contact.

1572,q4efes,I don't think im actually bipolar,"I think when I was diagnosed a few years ago, it was just circumstances that lead to my hospitalization that made it seem that way.

Here is the story. 6 years ago me and my then wife were having problems, I had just broken my foot at work, and couldn't walk for a little over 5 months due to a difficult recovery. I think things were strained between us for a long time and we sort of just had an argument that led to us separating. Literally anyone in that position would get depressed, i just lost my wife and could barely walk at all. 

Was basically just living with my grandparents since I was 23 and let my wife stay in our apartment. One day I decided enough was enough and attempted suicide. Again, might be a bit extreme but anyone in my position would at least be considering that option.

Well thankfully there was a place that could help me where I live and they made me do inpatient for a week while evaluating me. 

At one point while going to group and working through everything i kinda broke out of the depression. And you guys know what that's like, I basically started to realize the situation I was in with 4 days left on my hospitalization. So I started getting really anxious and fidgety. Anyway after the hospitalization I was still feeling that way and when they went to reevaluate me I was showing some of the symptoms of mania. Put the two moods together and you're gonna get the good I'm bipolar diagnosis.

Well i stayed on my meds for a few weeks and then my ex wife brought me the divorce papers and I attempted suicide again. After the hospital visit I stayed on more meds (seroquel, lithium, trazodone, and a few others) well then I moved and couldn't get more meds so i had to abstain for a few weeks. And in those weeks after, i felt nothing. No depression, no anxiety, just normal. And for the last 4 years off meds same thing, just chilling, working, playing video games all that. Like literally nothing negative, no suicidal thoughts, no mania. Obviously a little bit of stress here and there.

Well cut to this last week, I got a new job and get hit with insomnia. Insomnia freaks me out so I start waking up with panic attacks and just anxiety.

I think my initial bout of divorce depression and my week long hospitalization. Along with the meds that can literally cause depression symptoms. Made me develop an anxiety disorder or something which I am currently experiencing.

Basically the only time I feel like i want to die is when my anxiety is bad. I honestly think i just have really bad anxiety sometimes and not really bipolar disorder. I know full well that I might be wrong here, and if anyone else spends 90% of their time not experiencing symptoms too then please let me know.

1575,ps892e,Help regarding my friends physical/ mental state.,"

   Hello!!! I am here to possibly get some clarity on a situation involving my best friend. She is a 22 year old female with several mental health conditions 
  So, we weren’t really talking/friends for about a year. We ended up reconnecting and literally started back off like we were friends forever. So around late June she was complaining about her health. She works a physical job, and said that she was having a hard time at work. She said that she was getting sick at work and throwing up/dizzy and kept having to leave work. So this lasted all through July and into august but it didn’t seem like it was getting worse.

 Late July we were supposed to be leaving on a trip, me, her, and my partner. The night before the trip she went to the ER because she said she was having an extreme migraine. So hours before the trip she had to cancel and didn’t come with us. Since then her health seems to be deteriorating. It started with the intense migraines. Then she said that she has been having muscle spasms that move across her whole body with numbness. It will come in episodes and she will cry and scream in pain. She suddenly wasn’t able to work anymore and took a leave of absence from her job. So she’s been to the ER at least 10 times the past two months, her pcp, a neurologist, and physical therapist. Previously the doctor said she MAY have fibro. 
She had an a brain mri, and I went with her to her appt. they said that everything looked fine.     

The neurologist stated at the appt that fibro can be hard to diagnose and she was not sure if she had it, so she didn’t want to formally diagnose it. Doc also stated that she should see a psych, which at first I thought was shitty to say to someone who’s having physical pain, also she already does see a psych and she is diagnosed with ptsd, bpd, adhd, and anxiety. 
 
Now after this appointment it seems like things are getting worse. Her family sort of in a way told her that they don’t believe her. She has been obsessing over it, and obsessing over parts of her body asking me if they look normal, such as the other day she kept telling me it felt like there was something inside her nose blocking her breathing and she couldn’t inhale. I try to calm her down when the anxiety starts to come out and explain to her that she is okay. 

It’s difficult because I don’t want her to think that I’m not supporting her, or believing her because in a way, I do. But I also think that there’s so much anxiety built up around it that she’s looking for things that might be wrong with her that really aren’t there. 

The other day she called me freaking out and saying that someone poisoned her shampoo and that her hair was clumping up and coming out and that it was fried off. I felt so bad and was scared for her. (She has a roommate sort of that is a family friend) She came over to my house last night and I did her hair for her this morning, and honestly it really did look fine and the same as usual. Her hair felt soft and definitely didn’t feel like any chemicals had fried her hair. Same length, no bald spots, no hair falling out, same thickness. So now that this has happened, along with her obsessing over symptoms that may not be there, I am sort of starting to second guess things. I am afraid she may need to see a psychiatrist and talk with them about EVERYTHING. Because it seems like she might be having a psychotic episode. 

I don’t want to mention this to her because right now I am the only emotional support she has. Her family is supporting her financially also. But I am worried that it’s getting worse. All the doctors and ER visits they have said nothing was wrong and that everything looks okay. So I really don’t know what to think or do in this situation. I don’t know if she’s going through psychosis or something, or if she is going through the physical pain but is a hypochondriac and having extreme anxiety about it. The thing about someone putting something in her shampoo is what makes me think it’s mental.

1577,p6s7ld,Just got back from hospital from manic episode from what reddit member said.,"Hey guys I just got back from the hospital. I had a manic episode as a member took information from this bipolar group and tried to smear my name in another forum and proof my point wrong as I was bipolar, ""You know what that tells us about him"" were is exact words. The problem is its a running forum where I have personal contacts, friends and work who didnt know I was Bipolar, they are asking me why I didnt tell them. I'v made some mistakes recently at work and I thnk them knowing Im bipolar is going to result in my termination. Also my friends have stayed away from me. My life is ruined because some piss ant rich privileged little white kid wanted to gain solidarity with others by showing I am a lesser human. Sound familiar, this is how the Nazi's started. Create fear then ofter safety then you have unity.

This is America and I can sue for Slander and Deformation of Character.  I was hoping other members might know his address and contact info so I can send it to my attorneys and they can sue him but I can't because its against the rules so Im really not asking that. Ironically he has a degree in psychology so his actions were not ignorance but malice.

You can PM me if you would like please. I'v tried to follow the reddit rules but I also have learning debilities and under the american disabilities act am asking for reasonable accommodation, if this post is deleted it would violate this law and could be accountable in the court of law.

Reddit Bipolar group is one of my  support groups and if Im preeminently banned I will fall back into mania and there is no telling what dangerous stuff Ill do.  I cant mention the members name so you  too will get burned. No such thing as free speech.

When looking into who qualified as severely mentally ill [bipolar disorder](https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/covid-19-support/covid-19-vaccine-and-people-living-with-severe-mental-illness/) was specifically listed. 

I had been skeptical of the vaccine especially coming from a very small red city but after reading that part I started making active attempts to get the vaccine.

I had COVID last November and it cleared within the first week. I thought it was totally unrelated but I did kinda have a minor hypomanic onset near the end. Then I had another the month after, and a full blown hospitalization and manic episode this summer.

Hi. I’m so sorry but I don’t have bipolar. I didn’t find a subreddit for mania and I wanted to seek insight from people who has experienced it before. I’m so sorry if I’m taking unnecessary space in the sub. Please take it down if I do. I’m not asking for a diagnosis but if this sounds similar to mania.

F20
Formally diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder with panic attacks in 2017, and ADHD-C in 2020. Informally diagnosed OCD and childhood emotional neglect caused C-PTSD. Soon being tested for borderline PD. 
I recently (3 months ago) started ISTDP-therapy, but my therapist is on vacation right now until two weeks.
I’m very high functional on the outside, to the point where my therapist says I have developed schizoid traits only from running away from all the bs I’m feeling inside. 


It started in the beginning of June when I felt myself tweaking and all of a sudden my brain got washed over with absolutely all amounts of adrenaline or dopamine or whatever and had the worst panic attack of my life I thought I was having a seizure. I went to the emergency room feeling like my brain was assaulting me with lots of adrenaline like it felt like I was on fire it was so much and my lips even turned completely pale. Ever since I’ve been tweaking like a motherfucker on speed.
I just turned myself in for the first time because whatever the fuck is going on isn’t good or usual to me. I’m not feeling euphoric but I’ve been having a severely unusual level of energy and agitation for nearly two months now, which I’ve been thinking just has been severe anxiety. I’m very control seeking body conscious so this feeling has freaked me the fuck out. I feel warm and tingly in my head all the time, or like there’s water showering down my head or that my brain is on fire. In general severely high level of anxiety, derealisation, depersonalisation, twitching, literally tweaking and EXTREME irritation. I’m very energised and sometimes I wake up throwing a tantrum. My thoughts are racing, I’m overanalysing ALL THE TIME and I always have new ideas over shit I’m obsessing over to the point where I get exhausted. I’m crippled in my room by anxiety. Way more emotional lability. Ex. Started self-harming just because I was feeling nauseous. Intrusive thoughts. I’m completely unable to rest or to sleep, I’ve been prescribed zopiclones to be able to sleep. I’ve been on vyvanse before for my adhd and it sorta feels like I am on that, just without the emotional regulation and the slight euphoria I usually feel from vyvanse. 

I’m fucking exhausted. I can’t fucking relax at all. I find myself screaming and crying sometimes and I even broke my phone during a tantrum. I have schizoid traits from complex trauma so I’m not used to this. 

My psychiatrist just gave me zyprexa, but I’ve had bad experiences with meds before and I’m too paranoid to try them. Fuck.",0,0

1584,oqxika,I think I might bipolar,"Disclaimer: Starting to realize I might have bipolar… will eventually bring this up to my doctor if I have the guts to since I ghosted the last appointment because the last time I saw him I was really sarcastic towards him since he sounded like an ass when I was updating him saying things like “ that’s why I’m here…lol… for u to help me??….” He was laughing and saying he never seen this side of me… I was half laughing too but I was actually annoyed by him :D

I had selective mutism in elementary school and In gr.7 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I was in and out of therapy/ medication till I was about either early 19 or 18… idek im turning 20 next month.

Between my doctor the word bipolar never came up. It was always just depression so that’s what I always ruled it out to be. 

When I read back on my journals, I noticed that I always say the sentences “ I want to hold on to this feeling before I get depressed again” and I describe it to be butterflies in my stomach, I’m productive asf, and I get so excited that I can’t even sleep. I literally pull all nighters when I get into this euphoric state of mind. I clean my whole room, I even fricken SANITIZE IT i deep clean it. I switch out my covers, clean my bookshelf, clean out my desk, shelves… I feel as though everything is turning out for the better. But then after I have a nightmare for a couple of days, I get depressed. Dedass why tf do I get depressed over nightmares that I barley remember?? I just feel so groggy. I also get depressed when I feel threatened by disrespect or disregard that I don’t matter. Ik I sound sensitive but whatever.

When I’m depressed I literally want to die. Unalive myself is always on my mind but I wouldn’t act upon it. It’s just literally the only think I can thing about when even the lightest thing goes out of my control. Like for ex… running out of eggs?? Ugh. I also get intrusive thoughts which… I’m pretty sure I don’t have to explain here. 

I didn’t realize it was a pattern until now when I’m turning 20.

I’ve done risky and on the spot things:

quit my job with no advanced notice 

“ghosted” my doctors and therapists, friends, people I knew

I literally bought a dog $1300+

I dyed my hair that cost around $290

spent $200 on makeup in one day

Spent $300 on online clothes also in one day….

got acrylic gel nails $80 that I diy removed them after a week (they usually last 1-3 months) because I got too angry  (I actually just took them off last night)

Idky I did that because I’m a broke person 

sexted (that shiet traumatized me :D  not because he leaked it, but because I was disgusted of myself I never thought I would do that. And now I can’t even look at my privates without feeling genuine disgust. He wasn’t even my boyfriend… just some guy online from tinder)

“dated”around

Lash extensions for again, no special occasion whatsoever
 
I’ve  spent a lot of money on food whenever I got pissed off. 

I also bought a gym membership in the beginning of 2019. I’ve never been to that gym Prior, and I never took the free trial. I just bought it and took the longest package they had which is 2 years. And NOW I never go to that gym. I go to the gym at a community centre… and even then, I don’t go regularly.

Most recently, I booked a tattoo appointment without thinking about it. Someone even told me they’re surprised I didn’t give it a week to think about, I just did it.  It’s not a small piece… I literally told the tattoo artist I wanted a huge back tattoo my budget is around 1.2k-1.3k+ mind you, I’ve never gotten a tattoo before and I also booked this when I was in my “happy” state of mind… :DDD 

Those are just the ones I remember from approx 2019-2021 ish

Some of these things I never told anyone I knew.  So yeah.

Even right now I feel calm and “normal”? Again… but right before this post I was actually sobbing and screaming into my pillow, biting my hands cause I was literally just done.

1585,ooyj4e,HELP - difficulty in transitions? Irritability?,"I have no idea if this is bipolar related but it sure got MUCH MUCH worse when I 'developed' bipolar in my 20's.

I have the HARDEST time with transitions, as in transitioning locations (or social situations to some extent) specifically. I'll be planning to go to my bf's house and I will be excited all day and have every intention of being bubbly and fun, but then for some reason moving locations/the transition of people just kills me sometimes. I already have a REALLY hard time with irritability ever since bipolar developed (worse in some moods than others but always there somewhat), and I can't even quite describe it but I just cannot deal with the transition and suddenly I become irritable super easily. This is not who I am, I hate it and am fully aware when I'm doing it, but I can't stop it for the life of me. I am just irritable in general but it gets worse in moments of transition. I am not mean, more cold and distant/uninterested. I have a harder time making those transitions some times more than others, and it fluctuates in severity. It is separate from hypersensitivity issues (mostly touch and visual for me) to some extent, although sometimes they will constructively interfere to a larger effect.

I feel like it's ruining my life even outside of the severe mania or depression I was used to (although I can't quite pinpoint my mood anymore and find it difficult to determine during an episode anyways). But I'm sleeping (5-6 hours, sometimes a bit more) and I'm not suicidal. I feel like there are two opposing forces fighting inside me and the devil usually wins.

And I DO NOT mean big life transitions. I mean walking 1 block to visit my boyfriend, things like that.",0,0
1586,onu6id,Going on a Cruise- Suggestions?,"Hello! 
Background: One of my more distant friends was confirmed with Bipolar Type 1 last year after a series of pretty high intense manic/bizarre episodes. In multiple episodes she’s mentioned to me and her husband that she thought I was going to kill/harm her (there’s not reasoning or logic behind that.) 

Last October, she was still adjusting to new medications , me along with a few friends spent the night at her house. I woke up to her about two feet from the couch staring at me blankly- I screamed and it really freaked me out, she had no explanation of why she was there.

Current: We booked a cruise over two years ago that has been rescheduled multiple times due to Covid. We will be sleeping in adjoining suite rooms on the ship, I’m slightly nervous about my safety just incase she has a manic episode in the middle of the night.  I also know in the past she’s had issues of not taking her medicine. 

How would you talk/discuss with a distant friend about your worries? The last thing I was to do is trigger her or make her feel isolated. Mental health already is stigmatized and I don’t want her to feel like there’s something wrong with her however I’m really anxious going on this trip. Suggestions?",0,0

Also, I've reached out in a state of miserable panic and confusion online tonight, and no one responds. And that's what is probably going to happen if I make that appointment, anyway.

&#x200B;

* I think about suicide 23 1/2 hours / 7 days a week, with half an hour of me being distracted by my cat
* I've been this way forever now because of early childhood trauma. I've never seen a reason for living and though I find stuff everyday, I have yet to find any good reason to keep me from killing myself in the eventually. All I have is my family cause goddamn if there is an afterlife I would spent eternity ashamed of myself for breaking their hearts, they've done so much for me I constantly self-loathe for being pessimistic, which ends up in an awful cycle of self-hatred. I do still consider doing it once they all pass away. 
* I stand by my argument that just as no one chooses to be born, no one should be forced to continue with their life. Suicide is every individuals' own decision and though it is really sad, no one should be frowned upon for choosing so. But I know absolutely no one would back me up on this, so it remains another one of my colder opinions. 
* Rapists should be castrated. You take someone's right to consent and, in some cases, their virginity,  I think your right to reproduce should be revoked. Ok, maybe not cut people's genitals off, but I think a lifetime of celibacy would be a fair punishment. 
* I have AD/HD as well as a panic disorder on top of bipolar and all my doctors seem to be constantly confused on how to help me. I feel like a child being moved around through so many doctors and having my family have to be on high alert on me all the time.  
* People seriously need to pussy up and stop getting so offended over swear words. 
* I once considered shooting up my school at least to the point of planning the attack. 
* Even if I go to jail, I really would like to kill someone one day. 
* I romanticize death and terrorism. And I know it's awful, but my trauma makes me so hyper-stimulated about the idea of dying and bringing your loved ones with you instantly. 
* I'm enby in a Spanish-speaking country and I'm mentally screaming any time someone misuses my pronouns, but I don't feel comfortable coming out yet. 
* Death penalty is necessary for extreme cases.

All in all, that symptom hurt me more than any other aspect of the disorder. Even when I was on the verge of a panic attack she WOULD NOT STOP. And a lot of the time, the things she says are crytpic and full of clichés (like repeating phrases such as ""you only live once"" again and again), like it's an automatic response.

I said that this made me uncomfortable because I wanted to be able to share stuff with her without it potentially jeopardizing my medications, and she said she keeps her notes intentionally vague and won't share information thats not relevant.

So my grandfather (on my moms side) died a few weeks ago. My mom has 2 sisters. At the funeral, my eldest aunts back gave out and she started having a panic attack before the services started and I had my panic attack meds with me. My other aunt works in psychiatric hospitals (idr the job title she has) but she works with medications, so I offered it to her to judge the matter. She took half of one of my pills, and I felt like a hero because my aunt was able to calm down enough to go to the services and see off her late father.

I mentioned this to my therapist, just that I felt like a hero and it all worked out.

The next appointment she tells me she directly emailed my psychiatrist about the situation and my psychiatrist had questions for me. This lead to an argument where I tried to express how betrayed and hurt I was that she did this behind my back without telling me, and she refused to apologize at all.

I'm pretty sure this breaches her confidentiality agreement, right? I was not a danger to myself or others. 

This betrayal lead me into an emotional breakdown where I actually almost killed myself because I was so overwhelmed with how exhausting existing is, and I havent allowed myself to be alone for the last 48 hours because im scared.

I moved into a new place in Feb. which overlooks a grand house. There's a pretty girl in that house and we somehow exchanged smiles. I had a very good feeling about, sort of infatuation I think. Then again, in due time I felt that the girl was so deeply loving me (with all the gestures, and signaling from widows etc).Her dad seemed concerned and uneasy about it.I was impressed although the scenario seemed desperate. I was blinded by the admiration towards me. Although, we never spoke or met we have  developed a connection. Then a couple of months back I realized that the girl is mute. So, that explained the signs and her dad's concern. I was mentally preparing to talk to her dad about a potential relationship. I believe in karma so, I just wanted to talk to her parents as my attempt and leave the rest to fate whatever the outcome(yeah.. Indian). Then one fine day(which was last week), she comes out of the house staring at me with zero expression.. no affection or care which she showed earlier. I was really confused by the mixed actions and it had to be something and my research brought me to the term bipolar. Now as I type, she still shows subtle signs like the lights on or off, windows open with the AC on (In India, these things happen with very protective parents). She's almost always looking for me. So, I'm really really confused. I wasn't prepared for it (I can't deny my own family either). I don't want to break a sensitive heart at any cost. Will a bipolar person forget love feelings soon (if I'm gone from here)  or will she keep on thinking that I might come back?  Should I behave such that I'm an arrogant brat and break her chain of feelings? Please advise me.",0,0

1615,jp309w,Sassy psychiatrist doesn't believe I'm bipolar.," I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at 13 years old, when I presented my first hypomania, and began an untreated cycle of extended periods of depression, and a splash or two of hypomanic episodes.

I've been going to therapy for the past two years, after 11 years or so without it, and I love my therapist. She's confirmed my bipolar diagnosis, with PTSD as well (tons and tons of emotional abuse), and recommended me to go to a psychiatrist, because despite all my efforts, my depression still got in the way too much.

The psychiatrist didn't, for a second, believe I was bipolar, she treated me as if I was delusional and just read it off the internet, and that I was really BPD, just because it's her specialty. I told her I had a horrible history with meds, and was really reluctanct to try them again, I had them trigger hypomania and depression before. She assured me I was worrying about nothing and prescribed me with Lexapro 15mg, I said fine, then she also prescribed me with exactly the same medication I told her I had problems with, big red flag. Later, I found out a friend of mine was also taking Lexapro, and that his psychiatrist prescribed him with almost half of what mine gave to me, which was the second big red flag.

After a month of feeling like a heroin addict, it finally kicked in and I felt ""normal"" for a couple of weeks until I got my first mania in two years, and now I'm going through our much beloved subsequent depression, and it's hard. I went to a revision and she kept treating me as if I was a confused teen that didn't want to accept my BPD diagnosis, she started to ask why I kept calling it mania. I told her I didn't want to take any more Lexapro because I was only getting weird side effects and back pains, and she refused to tell me how to get off it. She pushed me into taking pretty strong anti-psychotics for my insomnia (I can fall asleep just fine, I can't stay asleep for long, pretty difficult to treat) and told me I could take them daily, after I told her I had acute IBS and didn't want to take any more meds that would be hard on my body.

My psychologist was pissed, she told me to get away from there, told me she was sorry and that it was weird that she behaved like that. And insisted that I demanded instructions to get off my meds, which I did, and now that it's starting to wear off, I feel much more miserable than when I began, but at least I don't feel like a zombie anymore and in control of my life.

I honestly don't know how people switch through meds, to me it's much more easier to live with my emotional imbalances than to go through this mind ruining rollercoaster just because a psychiatrist feels like it.

And I strongly believe this will be seen the same way we see lobotomies and shock therapy now.",0,0

Just overly anxious. Health anxiety. Panic attacks. GAD. A little OCD as well. I went through a really bad run in 2016. Since then, things were going really well. I was functioning normally. Well my dog died last March suddenly and that fucked me up. It took me almost 6 months to pull myself out of that rut. I started doing well again, and then c19 had to come on by, and with all my anxiety history and issues, I’ve been a off and on mess since March. I was coping okay, until July. I started having panic attacks weekly, then daily, then went into a complete spiral of anxiety and due to how bad my depression was affecting me, I become depressed. I seemed to pull myself out of it slowly, it was fucking hard. I was literally staying at my moms everyday for a month because I couldn’t be left alone due to how bad my anxiety was. I had/have a major fear of fainting. Anyway, like I said I slowly was coming out of it. I forced myself to stay home one day, and I did it! And I stayed home. I felt like I was becoming more productive again, still having panic attacks off and on but I could handle them. Only issue I still had/have is bad insomnia every night. I started laughing again. Smiling more. Joking with my husband and having sex with him again. I felt like “I made it through it, I fucking did it”.. then, a few days ago out of nowhere I woke up feeling off. Ever since Friday I’ve been feeling way more anxious again. Basically how I felt at the beginning of my last anxiety break down. I’ve been assessed by many professionals btw. Anyway, i did something stupid and googled and somehow came across bipolar disorder and now I’m obsessed with worrying I have it. Today I was having such intrusive thoughts this morning, I kept saying what if I open the door and jump out of this moving car? What if I like lose my mind and I can’t control it and I just do it? I’ve had intrusive thoughts before but these were so scary.. I don’t know if I’m in the right place and yes I’m aware nobody can diagnose me on here. I just want advice from people and if my experience sounds like it could be bipolar.. or if this sounds more like just bad anxiety and anxiety induced depression.

1621,j46wxj,I spent over $3k on stuff over the past couple weeks and idk if it’s mania or not,"So I’m a big gun guy, and I’ve had this project I’ve been working on for a little over a year just laying in my closet being neglected. So after getting ripped off and realizing buying the other tools needed to do this project myself would cost the same as getting it professionally done I decided to ditch the sunk cost fallacy and pay for that. In total it’s gonna cost about $700 to get it taken care of. 
Next my anniversary is coming up and I wanted to get something that said ‘I’m sorry I buy lots of guns, please don’t leave me’. So I had my heart set on a pair of diamond earrings for her. After some looking around, I found I nice set of classic styled lab grown ones for $300. Probably overbought, but we are getting married next year, so why not. 
Today, I bought $1k in ammo online. Like the rest of the world, the gun community is on fire. It’s a mix of an election season, COVID, and the riots that’s causing the issues, but suffice it to say that everyone is buying everything, even if it’s price gouged. That being said, I have a site that I go to for most of my gun stuff and they had bulk packs of rifle ammo for pre-order. After checking around and coming to the conclusion that the price was probably not gonna drop, I bought it and a case of larger rifle ammo as well. The good news is that they have a 4 payment program for their stuff, which is awesome!
Now the question isn’t about the money, I have it. I’m not gonna go starving or homeless because I spent this money. What I am wondering is if I’m just rationalizing these purchases?

1623,izzo6l,"Would you rather be a rich, horrible, mentally ""typical"" person or bipolar & getting by?","Disclaimer: not all rich people are bad people, not all middle class people are good. Not the point. As a social worker just getting by, I'm just taking different extremes & lumping them together for the sake of a discussion.

Would you rather have it all financially, be totally set & comfortable for life, a chef, a hot tub, a moat, whatever your vision of material wealth is, but be naturally stable while also being a shitty human being...or would you rather just get by (taking manic spending sprees & depressive buys into account), feeling wonderful sometimes & feeling like you want to kill yourself others, but be an inherently good person that has bipolar disorder & suffers from it.

To be honest, I wrote this with the intention of saying I'd rather be a bad person that's financially comfortable. As I've written this out, I've had a change of heart. I suffer. I want to kill myself often (shout out to my dog, Dodger, for keeping me here). Or sometimes my cycling fucks me up so bad, I don't feel like I'm standing on solid ground.

But there's a homeless man always standing on my exit with a sign, ""your donation would be a blessing."" I've never given him any money, my bipolar-related spends have made it so I'm just getting by. But everyday I get off that exit with my dog buckled into my passenger seat & I stop quickly to say hi & how are you. He sees my dog, he smiles & says ""there he is!"" Maybe he's an alcoholic & I should judge him, ""get a job, bum!"" Maybe he's a drug addict & I should scold him (because I'm so put together myself). Or maybe he's a Veteran that's been given the run around, as many are. Maybe he's just a nice guy that's having a hard time. Or maybe he's an alcoholic or a drug addict, a human being that has become dependent on a substance to live & is just trying to sustain the only life he knows. Regardless of the answer, I hope my dog's happy face makes his mornings. But I do digress.

I think I'd rather be a good, hard off person with bipolar than a wealthy, ""typical"" person without. In a way, writing this out gave me a little more self-love. I suppose I could do without a hot tub if it meant losing what makes me, me.",0,0

I have no recollection of such things, and the human mind is interesting in that I also don’t remember much of my childhood at all. Led me to thinking maybe this is just a mechanism that occurs with natural selection. I’ve always for as long as I can remember had thoughts of suicidal ideation and always felt obliged to be on the planet. I’ve heard that suicide hurts others in that it transfers the pain from the person who commits suicide to the others who’s lives intertwine with them.

I don't mean to downplay regular depression, as it can also be severe enough to make someone feel suicidal, but Bipolar depression is a whole other ballgame.  It's frustrating when people assume it's the same as ""plain"" depression.  With regular depression you can fake your way through to some degree, try to use positive thinking, muddle through, fake it till you make it, etc.  With Bipolar depression that doesn't work. 
How would you describe the sensation/experience of Bipolar depression?  I'm curious if others can relate.
To me, it's like I have a severe flu.  My muscles don't work, joints ache, I can't think clearly and have such fatigue that moving from one room to another feels like I'm going to collapse into a puddle of exhausted tears.  All you can really do is cry and sleep.  Being conscious is hell.  It feels like you've been buried 6 feet under and you're all consumed by blackness.  It's like your existence is akin to wading through tar.  There's a black cloud that won't ever lift.  It feels like it will always be this way and won't ever get better.  There's no hope or end in sight.  The emotional feeling of all encompassing sadness feels like your soul is literally in hell.
Can anyone relate? ;)

1661,fkwq65,What I feel is Bipolar Disorder inside of me,"I'm not a ""self diagnosis"" person at any length (those people who read three symptoms and then magically diagnose themselves with the problem).

But.

I feel that I've had some bipolar thoughts that I should probably discuss with my therapist / psych.

Throughout a 16 hour day, there are at least four or five times where I literally lose all ""hope"" or ""motivation"" to do better.  And then there are four or five times where I look at my life and say, ""This isn't all that bad, I am going to choose to be happy and lively, supportive, and engaging.""  I also bounce back and forth despising and hating features about myself that I can't ever change (my voice, body development, hair texture, physical appearance of myself).  One hour, I hate everything about myself, and then the next hour, I'm happy go lucky.

A real common occurrence is when I'm going through the toy aisle and I see toys that my little one would enjoy and I feel sad that I can get my little one a kitchen set and it can give him hours of enjoyment...from such a simple gift from me to him...

1665,fgpeq9,"can’t tell if it’s bipolar ii, ocd, or both.","Hi! 
BACKGROUND: So I was diagnosed with OCD at 12, have been on over 12 SSRI’s and SNRI’s, and had a six month stint in the hospital for anorexia.
I just went to another psychiatrist today who said he thinks I might have bipolar ii. 
Here’s the thing, though - my hypomanic episodes are definitely on the lesser scale, not flow blown mania. Also, I can sleep during these episodes. 
Mostly, I just feel like my moods are all over the place, but daily. Like intense swings for no reason, every day. Every night though, I always go back to the anxiety/depression. 
So I guess I just don’t understand. 
Has anyone had anything that sounds similar? I’m not asking if this is bipolar - I did read the rules and I don’t expect anyone to diagnose me! - but moreso asking if anyone has a similar experience, maybe with OCD and violent emotional shifts daily as opposed to in longer stretches?",0,0

1667,fd33oh,"Ive been diagnosed after 20 years of suffering, everyone's happy for me because know we ""know how to treat the mental pain"", but we don't and their optimism frustrates the hell out of me.","Saying that 50% of bipolar patients go into remission without having to waste their free time (let's be honest, after work and chores, every hour counts) on counciling constantly would be optimistic. 50% remission (even forgetting counciling) is a high number, but much lower than you, myself and thousands of other people deserve.



What's more, I already have issues with energy and there are only two non-sedating meds available to me (meaning, they will do lots of harm) taking them would replace one issue with another.

So realistically, the odds that I'll no longer have to deal with a severe mental illness or mild to moderate one (or, be put in remission) and not have to suffer (and yes, I know that a large portion of people suffer LESS) is quite low.

Am I missing something. Why is everyone around me so optimistic? Even if I'm lucky and beat the odds and go into remission, itll likely take awhile to get there, which means even more suffering. What's more, I barely have any fun time. Throwing in an hour or two of counciling a week will make my life even more void of free time. And that's that best I can hope for. Assuming I beat odds stacked against me.

I dont want to be part of the majority and have a reduction in symptoms. That just means I'll be living with a mental illness my whole life that's less severe. So what? What's so glamorous about living with an emotional disorder that isnt so life-ruining that it isnt considered severe?

Am I not allowed to feel that? Fuck ""training"" myself to be optimistic in the words of my mother, who called recently. Fuck the people who get mad at me for going with the odds and being aware that I'll most likely never be in remission and will continue to suffer and fuck bipolar.

I'm failing to see the point of trying to get better now and suffering while doing so.

1671,f3unf8,My boyfriend has bipolar,"Tl;Dr Yes, I'm dating a guy with a bipolar for two years now. Me [19F] and Him [21M] are in long distance relationship. I hope i Didn't triggered anyone or offended about this title but i meant no harm!What I'm saying is that, he is wonderful. Everything about him is perfect that ai can't even see a slightest imperfections about him. 

The thing is that, His ex-gf left him back in highschool because he has a bipolar and hasn't taken medications back in the day when he find out. I think she's around 17 years old and he's 18 years old when they started dating. She remarks that he uses his mental illness to manipulate her and to force to have sex with her.

She left him and started to spread rumors around the campus that only him and her knows about his mental illness 'cause of his image and his parents job. She told her family and friends and even ""his"" friends about that.

The thing is, she's not the only victim. He's the victim aswell 'cause his feelings was out of control. Having bipolar is serious that you can even having a mental phase and depressive phase without any reasons. What he needs is a help, guide, and understanding partner from her. 

The funny thing is, until now she keeps posting about shady stuff about him about ""having mental illness doesn't have the right for you to behave like that"". I can't understand the reason why would she post that on public. If she still angry and bitter about him, then atleast she could've talk to my boyfriend or to her circle of friends not ruining someone's life who is mentally stable right now.

But what I'm really glad about it her leaving him? Is i get to met my Boyfriend and guide him. He's taking medication right now and is completely opposite the one that his ex-gf talked about. He is like a marshmallow that I adore alot. What I felt sad about it is that he didn't get to enjoy his highschool days because of his ex-gf.

1672,f056vm,Does this sound like bipolar to you? Please help.,"Hello everyone, the last two years have been the absolute worst years of my life. My overall mental has declined. What does this sound like to you? 

•One major panic attack in 2017 triggered this decline in my mental health. I had a very bad drug experience smoking weed and had to be admitted to the hospital because I thought I was dying. 

•Constant fear that what I smoked was laced. Fear that the weed did permanent brain damage to me. 

•My overall mood is up and down. I tend to become very angry at my mother and father and last out at them.

•After having a good day (like going out with friends or a small trip) the next day is hell for me because of the sadness. I usually cry after having a good time. 

•Complete lack of motivation. I am an artist and now I rarely feel like working on any projects. At my job I feel like making through each shift is a challenge. 

•Was consumes for months (if not a full year) that I am schizophrenic. My doctor told me that I was not...but I couldn’t rationalize this in my brain. 

•Rarely spend my money because I fear that this shows that I am irresponsible and possibly manic/bipolar. Because I read that excessive spending is a sign of bipolar. 

•Constant scary existential thoughts about the nature of being a human. Almost as if I am scared to exist. 

•Feeling frequently disconnected from my life as if I am going through the motions 

• Constantly questioning my sexuality. Grew up in a very conservative house hold. I think I am gay but believe I will never be able to fully accept this aspect of my life. 

•sometimes sudden I treat in sex. 

•Sex is such a bizarre topic for me. Feel as if I want to have sex but feel that I am not attractive enough for it. Feel as if I am to disgusting for it. 

•Needing constant validation from others. I am convinced that I am ugly and overweight. When I look in the mirror I just think how disgusting I am. 

•Fear of being  narcissistic and or psychotic. Although everyone around me says that I am not...I can’t believe this. 

•Sometimes when I go out into public I feel like everyone is judging me and thinking that I am ugly, weird, and for some reason poor. 

•Think that most people hate me and do not enjoy my company

1678,ds3y7u,"I've reduced a lot of the symptoms of my depressive states ... with cocaine, please give advice","Hey guys, I first posted on Med Mondays but my comment got lost, so I made a post.

I've  been so depressed lately, I just can't do ... anything. It's a handicap, I spend days sleeping, doing NOTHING. As a  recreational and very ponctual user of cocaine, I tried two weeks ago to snort a little line before doing my vacuuming and laundry... and it worked out great !  Then I had this difficult day at work, I knew I had to work fast and  efficiently, so I went to the toilet to snort a little line, and OMG,  what a productive day I've had at work !

I am being treated for bipolar (Lamictal, Amisulpride and  Analfraline) but it's mostly my crippling depression that makes me  unable to do the little things. Now it's been 10 days since I've started  snorting a little line here and there to push me to do the little  things that seem impossible. The quantity I do are so little, I don't  have ""hangovers"" nor do I feel high. It's just a stimulant. Actually,  I've reduced my xanax drastically, because I feel energetic and  motivated so I don't have as much anxiety as I used to. I feel so good being right on schedule and being able to finish my day-to-day to-do lists.

I am going to talk  about this with my psychiatrist, of course ! But I just wanted to know  if anyone had a similar experience and if I could replace this shitty  illicit drug cut with baby powder and all kinds of toxic substances with a prescribed clean equivalent. I feel so fulfilled  when I'm able to do things, it really makes my depression better. I feel great, I am productive at work and with my personal stuff. It's such a huge change ! I realize it is SO BAD for my health (+ the mix with my medicine) but this is exactly what I needed all along !

What would you guys recommend (as a prescribed ""normal"" drug) that could give the same stimulation, energy and little euphoria (at least good mood)  that cocaine induces ? For 1) cocaine is expensive, and I can't keep going like this money-wise and 2) I don't want to end up an addict on a shitty street drug. I'm a good, normal person, with a very normal job. If it wasn't for my bipolar, I'd be Mrs Nobody. So the cocaine addiction is not an option, but it's made me do things I have been incapable of doing in months, if not years !

Her dad/my ex is bipolar 2, I’m bipolar 1, and my current boyfriend is bipolar 1. So I’m not sure if she’s just going through normal puberty things (she had her first lady cycle about 10 months ago and is positively racing through all the physical parts of puberty) or if she’s starting to show signs of bipolar. I’m surrounded by bipolar, so I guess that’s all I’m seeing, not to mention that my own developmental years weren’t “normal,” they were bipolar years, so I don’t think I would recognize normal anyway. 

She’s in therapy for anxiety and her temper, as well as just handling her dad and I splitting - it happened 5 years ago and she still talks about it as if it is extremely painful, even in the moment, so I figured therapy was in order. She loves her therapist, but the therapist is unwilling to diagnose her with anything past “general anxiety” bc of her age. 

I’m just not sure if I should take her to a psychiatrist and have her evaluated. Should I? Or should I wait and see if things even out over this school year, maybe? 

I don’t know if I’m fully on board with the idea of medicating her already, but if she is showing signs of bipolar, I would definitely like the therapist to be teaching her more applicable coping mechanisms, maybe get her one of those mood tracking apps, something like that. I have one of those bipolar workbooks we could work through together, that would be good for both of us.

But he didn’t seem like himself, and would CONSTANTLY talk about his, frankly insane, business ideas and was just generally really really weird. A week later he was in the hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar 1. Us roommates were there for him, giving him support, etc. Now he’s stable and on 1500 mg meds, seems like he’s back to normal.

So say that was roommate 1. Now another roommate, “roommate 2” is doing the exact same shit. He had a conversation with me about how he believes he’s the reincarnation of MLK. He wants to start a religion. He wants to become president. These are all apart of his business idea, in which he wants everyone to become vegan to save the world. Me and my other roommates are pretty bewildered by this situation. We’re scared honestly. But I know that this stuff happens naturally, and all we can really do is be there for them and help them.

I was always fairly successful and independent, so this is a culture shock for me. I’m in a constant state of depression and anxiety. Maybe a mixed episode once a week. I was reading about ketamine therapy and ECT, and many experts are comparing mushrooms (a much more affordable and safe method) to these therapeutic benefits. Basically, it jumpstarts your brain. It’s been roughly 8 years since the last time I tried mushrooms and it was a very positive experience.

1704,bq5w2p,I think I'm hypo but..,"I can go into mania if I smoke some weed (I smoke everyday for chronic pain and bipolar and recreation) and if I smoke a lot I go into the beginning of a psychotic break. 

Okay some back story before i went in the hospital I was obsessively trying to train my dog. The day I started blacking out and my mom took me to the hospital I had been up all night running around with my dog trying to make her aware of everything and to systematically check everything so that I would always have someone looking out for me (I was also training her to be a service dog). I was doing that type of training for a month or something idk how long I was manic.

And guys guess fucking what!! It actually fucking worked!!! 

Okay so the hospital was at the end of November and since then my dog does some communication like she lets me know if she's uncomfortable and I need to help her and she hasn't really had to help me yet but school is ending and I'm going to see my bf less and I'm going to start working again and there's just quite a few things changing. A week or two ago I started having some problems grasping reality, I would sometimes feel like this is all a dream and everyone was fake and at any second I was going to wake up and lose everyone. I thought it was being triggered by my period but that ended two days ago and now I'm hypomanic. 

Two days ago I smoked a lot which I normally do at night and my dog came in and was doing some things I taught her. She loves chasing the ball so I taught her to communicate by bopping the ball with her nose. I can't really explain what she did exactly to make me take her to my bathroom (my bf was sleeping in my room and he doesn't need to see me talking to my dog) anyway I took her to the bathroom (I had the ball) and I asked if something was wrong and she got excited like finally bitch you figured it out and tapped the ball then I asked if she was okay and she did nothing and then I asked if I was okay and she tapped the ball then I pointed to my head (I was technically pointing to my eyes and I found out after that my pupils were very dilated which also happened during the hospital) and she tapped the ball I pointed to my nose and mouth (I was supposed to point to my body but i forgot like most of her training) and she did nothing and then I asked if it was an emergency, she tapped the ball and then everything got fuzzy and really weird.  Like I felt fuzzy and it felt like there was static everywhere and things got a shade whiter. I went back in my room and realized I missed two doses of meds (I don't think that was the reason because I still took half a dose the first day and I took the full dose that night) and I started panicking and shaking and my bf calmed me down after awhile and I told him what Amidala did and apparently he believed me. 

Now yesterday, I did the same thing because I'm a dumbass who likes weed a little too much I also may have been trying to get a good video but that's beside the point. We were going to the dog park and I started freaking out and started crying and the dogs had been doing all the little signs I taught them to do to check in with me and then when I started freaking out they started freaking out really really bad and I was trying to remember what I was supposed to do but Amidala just kept looking and looking for something but I couldn't figure it out and it caused a meltdown. I was finally able to calm down and Amidala even told me I had mascara running down my face. We went to the park and they were still doing the little signals and checking everything and Amidala wouldn't drop the ball and she kept going over to the water without drinking and she was trying to tell me there was no water in one of the bowls. Also it had felt like we had just got there and we had been there for an hour. Also my bf doesn't really believe me on this one he just thinks they were freaking out because of the dog park, it scared him though and I feel bad.

I'm so fucking excited that all the shit I did wasn't for nothing like I actually fucking did it, it's going to take a minute to figure everything out again but I just needed to share the fact that I fucking taught my dog to warn me about psychotic breaks (honestly idk if that's what it is but that's what happened with the hospital and I think the reason I'm not blacking out is because I'm eating sleeping and hydrating -barely but still-) I'm so insanely shocked you have no idea, this whole time I thought that was all for nothing I ran myself into a psychosis teaching them and I thought it was for nothing but it fucking worked. I TAUGHT MY DOG TO FUCKING SAVE MY LIFE how fucking insane is that!!!!!!!!

I'm going to have my friend who knows dogs more than my bf to watch me get really high and see what happens I also think I want to go to my psychiatrist and tell him I'm going to come in super high so I can be observed by a professional, I want Amidala to be observed not necessarily me but I need my friend to do it first just to make absolute sure I'm not insane.

Sidenote that has nothing to do with my post but I'm also very excited that I'm manic this shit is so fun I feel amazing and I'm loosing weight, probably because I'm eating less. Also I'm going shopping later and the timing is so perfect 😂 I'm gonna have to have my friend take my wallet 😂😂

1705,bj1w9s,"When I found out how much I would be paid monthly if I get disability, I would still need to work one or two jobs. How fucking ridiculous. Reassure me that I can work again.","So, I was forced to leave my job in February of this year due to me having a complete mental breakdown followed by massive panic attacks, which prefaced the massive manic episode - all caught on camera. My boss watched the entire thing from start to finish. She deemed me a dangerous liability. 

I’ve been going to school during that time and it’s honestly hard for me to even get to class twice a week, but I’m trying my best because I missed the drop date and this is my **last** chance to pass this class. I hate the mixed episode I’m in.

My psychiatrist doesn’t want me to go back to work because he doesn’t think I can handle school and working again. He might be right. It could end up very badly, but I don’t have much of a choice. I can’t live in on what would have been less than a biweekly check allotted for the the month. I’m so stressed out trying to find a job because I’m scared Of how it’s going to effect my bipolar disorder with that big of a change. I’m scared I’ll turn into Eeyore for a month or six and just be a shitty employee. I’m even more scared of how batshit crazy I look during my manic episodes. And I’ve been rapid cycling on and off for at least 5 years, so everything’s possible. 

This time, I want it to be different. I don’t want my customers knowing that I have mental Illnesses. I don’t want my coworkers to believe that I’m crazy. 

I’ve been applying to jobs that I feel like I would like to do and where I can eventually bring my service dog in training after he does more training with myself and a professional. And I need to save up for this because it’s super expensive. The shitty part of that though is that I have minimal experience outside of the kitchen and I don’t think I could work in a kitchen again. 

Second problem I face is drug testing. I use prescribed doses of medical marijuana to substitute for Xanax. I wanted to work at Amazon but when I told them that I had a medical marijuana script that helps mitigate my disability, they said they use federal laws. It really hurt my soul because I felt like, one - it’s legal to use recreationally now and two - if people use it as a medication, it shouldn’t be discriminated against. There’s so many disabilities that have found it useful and it makes me feel like they **do** discriminate against people with disabilities. To discriminate against a treatment is ridiculous to me.",0,0

1707,bhuquw,Am I bipolar and having a hypomanic episode?,"Hi everyone. I've been feeling really weird since it became sunny where I live. I'm usually very diligent, calm, and asexual. But exactly one weekend ago when the weather drastically got warmer, something changed and I haven't felt the same since. 

I feel like my heart is aflutter, to the point where I can't focus on the work I need to be doing. But I also feel REALLY alive, and I've become obsessed with a comic I found, like SUPER obsessed (which doesn't usually happen). I'm also very surprisingly horny, but I don't want my SO to touch me. Just myself (that's been the case for a while, as I'm sex-repulsed). Furthermore, I can't help but have these thoughts that I want to break up with my SO and move far away by myself. I've had these thoughts for a long time, but the urge to act on them has never been this strong. I know it's irrational, not wise for many reasons, and quite a mean thing to do.

I could only describe this feeling as Spring Fever, but I did a little Googling, and I'm afraid I might be having a hypomanic episode. I've never had any mental issues at all. I HAVE been working 18 hours a day every day since last October at a dream job that I love and have been giving my all to. And I did read that not going out much during winter may cause something like this state. 

Anyhow, does this mean I have been bipolar? What do I do? And how long will this feeling last? I need it to go away so I can focus again on work.....

1714,as1ozj,How do you handle manic mistakes?,"Context: Met a childhood family friend that I had always liked growing up. I had just gotten back into the country after years and reached out to her regarding circumstances in her life and offering support if ever she needed. 
She then started to show up at my place and drag me out with her and kept making plans for us together, until things got more intimate. Her personality changed, she ghosted and left me without a word. I gave her space(4months, I had to calm my own emotions from the ghosting) and finally when I saw she wasn’t reaching out, I did. She pretended nothing ever happened. 

I was confused but took it as rejection, it never really mattered if we didn’t get together, but she was someone I cared for and didn’t want to lose in my life.(logistically because I am supposed to move country mid year, I figured it wouldn’t work anyway but I was willing to give it a shot, to try at least. If it didn’t work out, staying friends was never a bad alternative.)
I only started to understand her condition(I’m a doctor) when I saw more of the signs and saw through the lies, narcissism, manipulation and gaslighting (both from her and her mother, who I guess wanted us to be together). I stayed by her for two more years hoping she would make amends on her own accord and helping her in the background as much as I could with the events happening in her life and the huuuge mistakes she was making during hypomania. It is so frustrating when I have to see her in person and she tries to talk to me like we are best of friends, is affectionate and acts like nothing happened between us. It’s so insulting and hurts. 
I wrote to her as gently as possible to try to get her to acknowledge at the very least what happened between us but only got silence. I understand that ghosting is an easier way to deal with things but would you do it to someone you grew up and have so much history with?

Then for a second I was like why do I need medication? Immediatly I was like no! Something is diffinatly wrong. I am glad I caught myself with insight before things went real bad.

I googled what to do when having hypomania. One of the results was meditation but to not try it during an episode if I hadn't before. Basicly saved myself from what ever would have happened because I have a daily meditation practice.

I started logging my moods in a mood chart app, which honestly I didn't want to do because I was hypo. I did it and I could do remembering back from Tuesday to Thursday.

1728,a7t1yj,Might be Bipolar?,"So, the point of this post is pretty straight forward. I haven't gone to any doctor's office or anything to possibly get diagnosed for being bipolar, but I've been looking into it lately, and I feel as if I've seemed to fall under quite a bit of the symptoms of being bipolar.

&#x200B;

So, here is the facts:

&#x200B;

I'm in 8th grade finishing off my last year of Jr High, and I noticed that I have been having a lot of ups and downs for more than I can actually remember. I always knew I'd have some on and off days, but I never really realized how extreme they really were until the other day. I was bored and I decided to watch a video about mental illnesses cause I had nothing else to do. So after it I decided to just go on the internet and take some of those self assessment tests for mental illnesses. I found one website that had a bunch, so I took them for almost every mental illness it seemed, and I noticed I scored pretty low in everything, except I got a moderate possibility of having depression, and very high possibilities of being bipolar and borderline. As I was curious, I decided to look for more of them on the internet and I scored pretty high in around every bipolar test I took. From doing some self reflection, I have realized that I don't gain much interest in anything. I am mainly focused on song writing, playing the guitar, and working towards being something in the rock industry, but I still sometimes seem to have little interest in that. I started getting into Nirvana a lot more recently, and heard about him having a bipolar disorder and doing drugs to try coping with them. I haven't taken anything yet, but a while back I was going pretty insane at a point in my life where I was practically yelling at myself, and my thought was to get on something to try clearing my mind off of most my general mental problems, and I haven't done anything, but I did pay for LSD through a friend of mine, trying to get something from one of her plugs. 

&#x200B;

\*But as I said, I have not received anything yet, and I wish not to get any comments on anything about doing drugs or such. I've already done a fair amount of research into that stuff\*

&#x200B;

I also noticed that I would usually be angry or frustrated for days at a time, and then would have a 1-2 day period where I would have a good time causing trouble with my friends. I've noticed I'd have problems with keeping relationships stable and okay. I have this really close friend-who we do have feelings for each other but decided not to date yet since she doesn't want to get into dating until she is at least 16-and I have told her about the mental illness assessments and me having thoughts of using drugs and that such, but she doesn't like me mentioning my problems for doing drugs. I've had some conflict with a friend of hers, which has a long backstory in of it's self, and I do get kinda pissed off and I can't really think straight or clear when I see them hang out together, or if she chooses her over me. I just start thinking about a different think every second when that happens, and I can't really clear my mind from it. She is always so caring and really great when I am with her though, and she usually always makes me happy when I am with her, but there are times when I just feel too angry about her or about nothing at all, and I just avoid any interaction with her at all, so I will just hang out with my group of friends instead. She has also asked me if I have suicidal thoughts, and I have told her that I never have, however I do find myself thinking about suicide around once every other month. Not really about it being better for anyone or that it would make me feel better or anything, but mainly about how it would go, what words I would leave behind on a suicide letter, and what it would be like for everyone afterwards. Nothing really too serious though.

&#x200B;

So, in a shorter version:

\- I lose interest in things quickly, find generally little interest in everything I do, no matter if I like it or not, and I find myself bored almost all of the time

\- I tend to cause problems in relationships, even my best ones, and I find myself usually being a problem

\- I usually want to be alone all the time, but when I do spend a good time with someone, I am happy, but I will still want to be alone

\- I get mad over very little things, and will generally be angry for no reason at all

\- I find myself having about week duration of extreme depression, followed by 1-2 days of feeling not as crappy

\- I have suicidal thoughts, but not very often

\- I have sleep problems where I can’t get to sleep until around midnight, sometime I wake up in the middle of the night. I’ll wake up tired right in the morning, but then not really realise I got little to no sleep, and don’t feel fatigued at all

&#x200B;

So, I really would like thoughts on what I have. Personally, I think I just have a bipolar disorder, BDP, and depression. However, maybe it is something different, and if anyone has any opinions, I'd be really thankful to hear them. Thanks!

P.S. - Also found out about the app Daylio from this sub, so I will be starting it from January 1st onward, and I may post updates about that if it may show anything usual to judge more on what I may be dealing with",0,0
1729,a7pboy,I might be bipolar,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here. I am a 25 year old female and English is my second language. 

For many years, I felt worthless, hopeless and depressed. In middle school I was often sent to psychologists and counselors by my teachers, as my mother refused to acknowledge there was something wrong with me, even going as far as calling me a ""sick rat"". I come from a single parent family, and only too late have I realized I suffer from ""daddy isues"" which lead me to make many many mistakes. With time, I got over that. 

My teachers saw there was something wrong with me and probably had the best intentions when they sent me to counselors. I was too afraid to speak the truth, so I would always tell them that the bullying was getting to me. I never told anyone how I actually feel and what makes me feel this way. It all came from home. My mother had several partners, and I hated them all. I sensed the evil in them. One of them touched me when I was little (it was nothing too severe so I kept quiet). The next one was just pure evil, he was very controlling and abusive. Watching my mother quietly take that filled me with sadness and hopelessness. It was the cause of my self diagnosed depression(later legitimately diagnosed as a depressive episode with no psychosis).I never told this to any professional at the time because I was afraid of my parents' retaliation. 

Years painfully dragged by, my sadness would come and go, but after a recent painful break up, something changed in me. I am more hopeless than ever, I cannot fall in love anymore, I have zero motivation and will to live. I am still afraid to go and see a professional. Last time I had to go (I needed papers to justify my 3 month absence from school), the doctor seemed to take what little I told him as a joke and I felt like I could not trust him, let alone open up to someone who seemed to have a condescending look on me and would not take me seriously. Fear was still there. 

I am easy to open up to strangers online, and through many conversations I learned what was wrong with me. Depression, daddy issues, lack of self confidence and self respect, strong suicidal tendencies. I read of these conditions online, and then I heard of bipolar syndrome. With all listed above, I think I might have this as well. When my cycle is somewhere half way and especially near its end, the symptoms only worsen. I become a toxic, self pitying, terrible person. Recently I noticed it was not only when its that time of the month. It happens on any day. Surges of happiness, inspiration, motivation, followed by dark thoughts, sadness and self pity, feelings of worthlessness and the ever present wish for death. 

I know I am well over due to see a professional about this, but how can I get over my fear of opening up to them? I am afraid that I am so far gone that I will need medication, and I do not want that. Im afraid of side effects and stigma. I wish to get better, but I am afraid of what it will take to get there.",0,0

1735,9ug78a,Are there temporary alternatives to medication?,"I stopped taking medication about a year ago because I had two periods of school I needed to do. I cannot read and retain information when I'm medicated. No matter what combination I tried, I just couldn't do it. I need to finish these courses and then I'm done school forever, I'll be certified in my field, I'll be able to start my own company and train my own employees.

I have less than a month left. I've been having little blips of what felt like the beginning of mania for the past month. But I'd wake up the next morning and feel fine again and be able to just continue on my merry way.

This morning I woke up feeling like I'd just been given a shot of adrenaline. I'm worried I'm stumbling into an episode, but I'm almost done! I can't be trying to find a med combo right now, I have exams to do and things to study and practicals to do. I think it might be daylight savings that did me in, that finally tipped my boat of stability. But holy moly could I not concentrate in class this morning. My legs were bouncing, pen was taping, I can barely read my notes they're all over the place.

Is there something other than medication I could try? Just for the next month. Does marijuana help? It's legal where I live so I could buy some at the store and try that?

She has been diagnosed as Bipolar type one. She has had this diagnosis for about a year now, it has been a bumpy ride. She is a great person at the end of the day.. some weeks she's my absolute best friend, other weeks she thinks I'm her worst enemy. Dealing with this has been more of a challenge for me because some days it feels like I'm the only one trying to get her to do the things she needs to do to feel better. She's consistent with the medications she takes, she is still working on finding the correct dosage. 
Last night, I asked her if she was in a place to have a heart to heart (she wasn't, I didn't know). I tried to ask about the fact that we only have sex about once a month. She freaked out. And I mean freaked out. Screaming at me that I don't love her ect. And not using any of the tools she has learned to pull herself out of this state. I kept trying to tell her that we should put this on pause so she can calm down. She escalated it even further, grabbing my arms, still screaming, and telling me I don't care about the life we've created together. Normally I would leave the room because we both need space when she goes through this. That was not an option. So long story short I reacted in a way that I'm not proud of and physically threatened her by getting in her face. She stopped. We talked it out. But how do you know when enough is enough?

A girl I've known for about 2 years know has suddenly cut me off completely after we\`ve been texting daily for the last 8\-10 weeks. During this time we\`ve met twice, gone out, talked alot, had lots of fun conversations and, considering everything, I really thought it was going rather well.

When we met in person for the first time alone after knowing each other and having on/off contact over the years, she was really open and we talked alot about her diagnoses, which she has only recently gotten (mid March). There had been multiple ocations were we were making plans do go out or have dinner together, but everytime something ""came up"" from her site, so that the date was canceled.

But I kept checking in with her, and we finally got to meet 2 weeks ago, had a great evening together walking around town and hanging out, talking. We were planning to meet again sometime last week, but once again, she cancelled. She told me she had to watch her sisters girl, and I didnt think anything of it. But since then, she has given me the silent treatmend.

Since she told me about her metal illness, I've been studying about bipolar in order to maybe be able to understand what she's going through, and I've come across alot of ""cases"" (for the lack of a better term), where bipolar partners or friends just shut down any communication for no obvious reason in order to be alone with their feelings they dont want to share or see as a burden for people around them.

While it would be difficult to just stop having contact after texting daily, I would, offcourse, give her the time and space she needs, although I'm not really sure if thats even the case right now, but she's constantly online texting on Whatsapp, even posting stuff on Instagram. My quenstion is: Is this normal behaviour or did she single me out? I really wouldnt know why and I'm very confussed. I tried reaching out to her twice via text, asking if she wants no contact or if I had done something wrong and if there's anything I can do to help. No answer.

Offcourse I dont claim to even remotely understand what it means to have bipolar, I just really like this girl, she's been my motivation to keep going after having a rough few months, and this situation is really getting the best of me right now.

Marijuana is going to feel different for different people just like some meds work for others and some don't. I know it showed him holding some pills and he said that people should get on the right medication, but my impression after watching him in the doc is that he is not on the right medication. I think he might make excuses to stop taking thrm because he likes the mania. I can't say for sure, obviously, but he reminded me of every other bipolar person I have ever met who gives excuses for not taking their meds.

1758,824vsz,Advice to help Facebook friend,"I have a Facebook friend who I know from high school, and at the risk of being an armchair psychologist I think she might be bipolar. 

She quit her job out of the blue a few months ago and started a go fund me to move to another town, no one gave any money so she went anyway with no money and no job. She goes back and forth between posting videos of her dancing (badly I might add) and saying she’s trying to build her career as a dancer, and posting videos of her swearing about her mother and crying because she has no money to eat and no one will help her. There’s things like inspirational quotes and trying to do a fundraiser for charity between these posts of her weighing herself saying her weight loss isn’t from drugs it’s because no one will help her.

I felt absolutely terrible and messaged her and gave her $20 (all I could afford) but the behaviour has escalated, tonight she posted a video of herself dancing in her underwear asking people to PM her and pay if they want to see more. This is a girl who a few months ago was a law student working two jobs at a law firm and at a pub, this is not behaviour I would expect from her.

1761,8167oh,I believe someone close to me has some sort of bipolar disorder and I could really use some advice on how to best help her on her bad days.,"Hey guys, I hope I've come to the right place because I don't have many places I can go for advice. This person) (who I'm trying to not mention by name or relationship to me for their privacy) has been suffering for years with crippling depression and anxiety and is currently perscribed antidepressants but it doesn't seem to help all of her symptoms and from what she says it's the only thing that somewhat works for her with the least side effects. 

Right now her environment is not very stable or healthy, because of a number of endless work, school, home and financial worries, as well as unavoidable conflicts with family members. On top of all that she has had more than a fair share of traumatic past events (which she had sought counseling about for several years but they didn't do much to help her cope with current issues). 
Despite this, her baseline personally is sweet, loving, an all around genuine and wonderful person to be around. But she has these ""shifts"" that can come about from the smallest trigger, where her personally changes completely and she becomes extremely angry, irrational, impulsive, and emotionally sensitive. In this phase it's like she's a different person and the anger consumes her to the point where she doesn't know what she wants and every word she says is typically something along the lines of her being worthless or undeserving of anything good in her life and that everything that does happen to her is something that she deserves because she's ""a bad person.""

At that point, there's no getting through at all and it usually lasts the entire day. I'm more or less her only support system and I have tried a number of approaches ranging from giving her space to work it out on her own, talking and assurance, and of course I've had a few regretful outbursts as well which I've learned to control because that's not helpful to her at all. If I go the talking route, we've lost entire days just trying to get her through an episode and that's not always possible when we have work and other things to do that day. 

At some point, she will simply return to her normal self, usually in the later evening. It's hardly even gradual but I can tell just by looking at her when she's shifting back. We can then talk rationally about things and she will apologize and I'll try not to dwell on talking about the episode for too long. At that point, she will also typically realize she overreacted or reacted based on expectation vs reality in a situation, which of course will drop her mood sightly, leaving her feeling that something is wrong with her. 

I care very deeply for her and truly want to help her more than anything. She wants help too but doesn't have many options at the moment and isn't convinced she's bipolar, but I believe she is and that her manic is anger instead of energy. But I don't know how to cope with it myself since we live together and I do care about her so my emotional attachment makes it difficult to be a support for her and deal keep myself from pacing anxiously like I am right now. She had an episode yesterday and is having one again today. I know she needs to seek some sort of professional treatment as soon as possible but if anybody can offer up some tips or methods or anything to help me and her I would greatly appreciate it.

1763,7uzgyt,Bipolar ex help.,"Hey guys, I'm just looking to get a little insight.
I met a girl five months ago, we hit it off like wild fire and it had been pretty much the same since then, we both fell hard and fast, or so I thought.

She told me early on that she has bipolar and some unresolved childhood issues with her dad, there also is an age gap of about 6 years, she's 21 and I'm 27.

We both went through some really intense stuff together like her getting a breast reduction and recovering from that as well as some drama with me and my long term best friend, throughout all of this we were strong and she told me she was in love with me and that she hadn't felt this way about anyone in a long time, she even made me bond with her family and we became really close.

Over Christmas she cried because she wouldn't be able to see me on the day and that I was the only one that she wanted to spend it with, so I pulled some strings and I made it happen for her, for us, silly me.

We spent a reasonable amount of time together over the holidays, around 15 days and there was no sign that we were going to break up or anything, in fact she told me that that would be the last thing she wanted and that she loves me and never wanted to lose me, she also stated that she feels like she was going to go through a manic phase and that she could always feel it coming, this was something I hadn't experienced before.

See the thing is I came back to my house (I live an hour away) and the next day she messaged me saying she thinks we need to talk, she broke up with me an hour later on the phone stating that she ""doesn't think we're compatible"" and ""that we'd highlighted some things about each other"" that she ""loves me but isn't in love with me"" and that she ""needs to focus on herself and doesn't know what the future holds or doesn't see it after her breast reduction"" i asked her to think about it for a week and come see me, she did that and came back down, returned all my things except a few and told me the same things, she was not acting like the girl I fell for at all and she told me that she wanted to kiss me the entire time she was there but then told me immediately that she didn't want to tell me that, she did cry however this is something she did constantly over nothing while we were together and ended laughing at how upset I was at one point, as far I'm aware she is medicated on 150mg of sertraline a day, I'm not sure if that has any effect.

Not only that but when she got home she blocked and deleted me off all social media and my phone number, I hadn't even pestered her or hurt her in any way, as far as I'm aware I treated her like gold, I loved her she was someone I never wanted to lose, I told her so many times her illness doesn't define her and that I would never judge or abandon her. But she just won't talk to me. 

My question here is am I just reading things on here that sound similar and making false associations or does this sound like something to do with her bi polar? Any advice or just general conversation would be much appreciated.",0,0

1768,7jajfy,My gf thinks I don't care what she has to say because I can't concentrate and lose interest quick.,"Bipolar 1 here. To start, I have issues with my executive functioning, meaning memory, concentration, etc, due to neurological damage from our lovely disease. Even when I'm stable, I am very poor at focusing, remembering, and most certainly splitting my attention and multitasking. Gf knows this very well. My attention span is wildly short...I often lose interest in an answer right after asking a question. So it's difficult to sit thru her long winded answers. 

She has been incredibly patient and id be lying if I say she's not understanding for the most part. I know I've got to get a hold on it because eventually she's going to start resenting me. I forget so much of what we talk about, what she says to me, or what happened. I can't multitask so if I'm focused on one thing, it doesn't matter if something else is going on in the room...my brain will not split attention effectively. 

Amongst the things she has become reasonably irritated at, she lately is especially bothered by the fact that I will ask questions that were just answered or evident from the conversation happening in the room. I live with her and her bf (we're poly), and so there's often a conversation going on where not all of us are involved. For some reason she expects me to be listening to all their conversations. 

Yesterday, she wanted to talk to me about it. She start crying saying she feels I don't think what she says is important because I don't listen. She's frustrated w/ the fact that I'll ask her a question, then tune out a few seconds after she begins answering or that my attention will fizzle out when I'm working on something and she starts talking to me. 

Kept telling her I understand why she would be frustrated, and that I myself am very frustrated with my concentration. Kept trying to explain that I lose attention with my own self! I'll get up to get something and lose track of the thought and forget why I got up! Or I'll have to read the same sentence 5x. 

I get that I'm probably extremely annoying for having to constantly ask her to repeat or answer questions I would've known had I remembered or been listening. I'm seriously trying to take steps to improve my concentration, especially since I know and accept now that I cannot at all multitask. But it's frustrating for me to have her understand I'm handicapped in this way, but then still hold the same expectations of me that she would someone without these problems. I tried giving her a solutions on many occasions (call my name or tap me to get my attention before just talking expecting me to automatically focus on you), but she doesn't really do it, or if she does, she still expects me to be listening when she doesn't first do it. 

So my questions are: 1) How can I effectively communicate that I need her to employ my solution so that we don't keep having this issue of unmet expectations; 2) for those who have cognitive issues, what are some strategies and tools I can use to be better...I would be very annoyed to have to deal with myself; 3) is there anything else I can do? Or a link I can show her?

Tldr; I have issues with concentration and memory due to BP, and while my girlfriend is very understanding and patient when it comes to memory, she really gets frustrated with me when it comes to concentration. She won't really take up my solution to this problem either, and holds me up to the same standard she has of other people who don't have cognitive issues. What do I do?",0,0

I have a history of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts but currently I am on medication that control them very well and I am very happy with my medication. My diagnosis is Gender Dysphoria and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My suicidal attempts and thoughts have been minimized ever since I started Hormone Replacement Theraphy (HRT).

Ever since I started HRT 18 months ago I have experienced a wider, more colorful range of emotions and I have become more expressive. Could the psychiatrist have construed my strong emotions/expressiveness as disruptive and think they need to be tempered with a mood stablizer? Why would she want prescribe it to me?",0,0

April 

He said he was going to Colorado to clear his mind I said great! he went to sleep with a woman he met at a work conference  they both flew to Colorado had a 3 day affair.
He broke up with me after...... saying he doesn't have these feeling for me that he doesn't love me. 
He feels horrible about what he did .
We got back together he was undiagnosed at this time, we thought it was the sex and love addiction. Maybe it was maybe not.

May 


We make up he says he's sorry still I can see something in his eyes just not right his eyes change when he does this to me his whole demeanor. He's sad then he's energetic he's a mess he sees that I'm hurting and he is just energetic not sympathetic.
We head to his family house at the end of May he said he stopped talking to this girl. He said  ""That was a huge mistake""

June 

He's a bit better we are taking trips to Utah and Colorado and Arizona it was great! 
one day while we were in the middle of our  trip he stops talking and gets super irritated we get into a argument one day the next two days he's back to normal he said he needed sleep and was hungry so Sure why not. 

July

We had a great time ! 
He tells me he might have a mood disorder his therapist tells him. He gets an appointment to see a Pdoc. We are waiting ....:


August

 Says he wants to work on his sex and love addiction and wants to be ""alone"" to work on himself. Lies !!! he went to see that girl again for the weekend flew over there . Calls me on Monday saying He's sorry and says he needs help that he loves me and he's scared of his addiction. I'm doing damage control He heads to a Buddhist retreat to clear his mind. He comes back more zen and peaceful he said he can feel emotions now.  
Since we finally waited for a month for this  enters the Pdoc she says you're depressed, prescribes him anti depressant LEXAPRO.
WRONG!
All hell breaks lose for two weeks he's an asshole irritable moody doesn't want to talk next thing you know he curled up in a ball in the corner fml talking about that I should just shoot him in the head. 

At the end of Aug we are headed to the a couples psychologist /therapist he gets off Lexapro and goes on Lamictal! 25mg and rises. 

Sept
 We are in couples therapy and it's great his Meds are working he says this is how I'm suppose to feel he says this is my moment of clarity, he's up to 50mg  he says I think I'm just going to tell my Pdoc to leave it at 50mg im like ok if it works for you it works for me.  Great month he's nice sympathetic just the nice man. I saw hope 

Oct
We are great in the beginning of the month toward the end his  job is getting stressful I tell him let meditate let's breath. It does  seems to work. Oct 29th happens he says he's going to do this by himself that he's been on bipolar pills for a month and doesn't have feelings for me , he says he wants to be alone to work on his recovery he doesn't see himself marrying me and having children packs my stuff into my car and I'm crushed so crushed  right away I think the Lamictal is not in therapeutic dose. He doesn't listen that same day he flies to see this girl I didn't know that till the middle of the week. Wtf! Is his problem he says he feels feeling for her, feeling he doesn't feel for me . Then he starts talking about conspiracy theories, how the Celebrities are into the sex scandal and how Hilary is covering it up. He's everywhere. His face his eyes everything is different. I take a pregnancy test I'm pregnant I'm sure that made him more manic he said how could you I don't see myself with you, your horrible kicks me out .He spoke to his Pdoc started raising up his dose of Lamictal to 100 and it's going to go up also gave him Xanax to calm his nerves. 

Nov

He is still up and manic tell me to abort the baby he doesn't want a child with me. I'm fucking losing it. He calmed a bit he still adamant he doesn't want me in his life. He's more worried about her and wants her in his life. He is going to spend time with her next week for his birthday. I'm so crushed. We had plans. 


Is this mania?
Is our 5 years lost ?
I'm starting to really think he didn't love. 
I feel abandoned. 
While he gets new life a new life is growing in me and he doesn't care.

1776,6jzy1j,I have a strong feeling im bipolar,"I havent got my Bipolar condition diagnosed, ,I always have had cycles of motivation and loss of intrest where im convinced that the new found interest is the best thing in the world and thats what im going to do in my life.Eg- Vegan diet, spirituality, astronomy, stock market, sudden motivation to make money or close all them 100 tabs in chrome that i opened as part of my research without a second thought. I get very involved, its all im thinking about in that time and i make promises and commitments to people around me and end up disappointing them every time. And because of this behaviour I havn't excelled in anything in life, i have no talent that Im proud of myself, including any socialising skills. Now i'm just locked up in my room and stoned most part of the day. I'm very confused with life atm, like to go through life with no talents and being useless to society. Also Im very lazy so i keep thinking ill be stuck in this room my entire life while feeding off of my parents like a parasite.

1777,64twwq,I'm gonna do a dumb thing,"Met with my psych today because I want to get off lamictal. It's been really good for me but I don't like the idea of being on meds forever if I can help it. We're going to keep the seroquel in the evenings to make sure I'm getting enough sleep. This could be disasterous but I've addressed a lot of behaviors that were contributing to my poor mental state (particularly the intense self-criticism and loathing). I'm pretty confident I can manage without meds. If not, well I'll obviously go back on. I'm also seeing a therapist regularly now to help with monitoring. 

So that thing could be dumb, or fine. The really dumb thing is going to a festival of sorts for 5 days in a couple weeks. There will definitely be drugs which I will definitely be doing. Talked with my psych about this too. Basically said ""NO COCAINE"" and less is more with everything else. Favorite quote, ""downers preferably, like opiates. Oh god I can't believe I'm having this conversation"" lol I had a problem with opiates when I was younger so even if they were around I have no interest. Most likely will stick to minimal amounts of molly and not so minimal amounts of shrooms. And will still likely be doing cocaine... No alcohol or weed. 

Certainly not the best time to be going off meds. Really looking forward to the trip though! It'll be an incredibly comfortable environment, lots of love and cuddles. I have another appointment for the Monday I get back from the festival. Wish me luck? You can scold me too if it makes you feel better. ",0,0
1778,5tre3g,I think I might have bipolar,"So let me start by sharing a bit about myself.

I'm 19 and a few years ago once I had left school I spent 2 years locked inside my room distracting myself with the internet which now looking back at it made it worse. I grew very self conscious and became depressed and when it got really bad was these random moments where I'd feel suicidal. So that's about 2 years of depression and no one ever really noticed.. not even I did.

Skip to now I've started college and even though I've gained some weight I generally feel better about myself after talking with a therapist about my problems.

And now recently I've gotten into a relationship. It makes me feel so good about myself at times but I've recently realized how rapidly and uncontrollably I switch between happy and sad.

That's putting it lightly though.. 

I've always had this thing where little things could make me really upset.. like one small example is playing games with friends.. and they get frustrated with me.. which is fine it happens.. but when people leave me and play the game by themselves or just leave me in general I begin to burst out and get incredibly upset.. feeling horrible and almost start crying over this little thing.

And being in a relationship is really messes with me.

I was reading some posts that people made about Bipolar and I never realized that being paranoid could be also be from it.. which in that case is a big plus for me because I get paranoid like crazy..

On my bad days when I go outside I feel everyone is looking at me and talking about me.. when people laugh behind me I feel they're laughing at me. I feel people are judging me around every corner.

My paranoia is effecting my relationship too.. A few days ago my partner was offline and never said why. It led me to get paranoid thinking there was something wrong and when they came back they didn't talk to me much and gave very uninterested responses.. I started to panic and felt like I did something wrong and that quickly grew into believing maybe they're going to break up with me and leave me causing me to explode and tell myself my life is over.. 
Later on that day though they started talking to me again and things quickly went back to normal and I realized I went a little over the top.

This happens often.. and the smallest bit of something can set me off to freak out and think everything is over.. but I also get very happy at times.. Sometimes I feel super confident and on top of the world like everything in life is going my way. And sometimes I can feel both paranoid and on top of the world in the same day. Like in the morning I look at myself in the mirror and think I'm handsome and feeling good.. then when I return home feel horrible and say stuff like ""I looked like this all day? eww""

I don't like to do self diagnosed things because it makes it sound like I'm just trying to get attention but I really think I suffer from Bipolar..

I realized it may be the case when I was laying in bed thinking my world was over because my partner didn't talk to me enough or something.. I just stopped and thought ""Why am I so upset what if I'm just being paranoid? why am I being so paranoid and why do I feel like I want to die?"" and thought of Bipolar because I remember hearing its symptoms were extreme emotional reactions and stuff like that.. 

After looking it up I found I pretty much have everything Bipolar does and ofcourse I'm going to try and talk to someone professional before ever outright saying I suffer from it but I just wanted to talk to someone about it which led me here.. 

It honestly would explain a lot because I have always noticed I react very emotionally to the smallest things.. like my previous examples.. I always walk around the house slamming my head against the walls telling myself everything is over and I should just give up. Even from the smallest things

Edit: I just wanted to add that when I do get upset, I find I can't focus on anything and I've actually got a black page bookmarked on my browser because I feel better when I literally stare at a black screen.. I can't watch any videos because I get annoyed and can't focus.. I can't do anything but stare at a black screen and calm myself down",0,0

My prescriber is on vacation until the 15th and said that if I have any problems I need to go to a hospital but I am not delusional or hearing voices so I think I am fine my parents too think i'm fine they don't think I'm bipolar (maybe I am not!!!) so it might be hard to convince them to take me to the hospital.

1785,59mlyr,Regarding Everyone's Least Favorite Word: Attitude,"**Your attitude --> Perceptions --> Mood --> Attitude**

That there is a feedback loop.  And there's one factor in there that is controllable, even if you're depressed.

I've always been able to stay high-functioning while depressed.  It's never interfered too significantly with my social life, academics, or work.  

That doesn't mean my depression isn't severe.  I've been suicidal by night, functional by day.  The depression is still there, waiting for me to pay it mind.  I've read a lot and drawn from personal experience, and I've come up with long winded explanations of how I think one can try to remain high-functioning while being depressed.  But I think it really just boils down to this.

What happens to you doesn't make you depressed.  It's how you perceive what's happening to you.  This is widely accepted in psychology and philosophy.  The chemical imbalance in your brain certainly affects those perceptions, but it's not the whole story.  We're not slaves to our brains.  We can change our perception and therefore our mood by resiliently controlling our attitude.  This creates a feedback loop, as demonstrated above

This may not be the complex answer you were looking for, but I find this to be an absolute, understated game changer.

I'm not saying those that aren't coping well have an attitude problem.  Well, I kind of am.  But what I really mean to say is we have to work that much harder to maintain a good attitude, and it's really our most empowering tool.  It's our way of denying the depression power over us.  It's our way of punching back, and the more you throw, the stronger you get.  The more you exercise this ability that we all have, the more depression loses its hold on you.  Even when it comes back, you know what to do and how to do it.

Don't just *be* in the fight that depression puts you in.  Don't just stand in the corner and let it pummel you.  Fight back.

Turns out this was another long winded explanation, but I hope this message was a little more succinct.

TL;DR:  Your attitudes forms your perceptions, which forms your mood, which forms your attitude.  Resilient people never lose their attitude, and that's why they cope better.",0,0

1787,5579tr,Bipolar Girlfriend Breaking up with me Over Misunderstanding,"I am a 29 year old male and I have been in a relationship with a 20 year old female for the last year and a half. I am the first person she has ever been in a relationship with.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think that she may be bipolar. I know for a fact that her aunt is and, as these things are genetic, there is a good chance that she is as well. She has constant mood swings. One minute she's happy and the next she's depressed. She hasn't told me that she is bipolar, but she knows that she has mood swings and she knows that these cause issues for her. She told me before that she was really grateful that I always stick by her through her mood swings.

Throughout the relationship, she has always got herself worked up over things that aren't problems. If she thinks something is wrong, she doesn't talk about it and she lets things build up in her head until it becomes an issue for her.

Examples from the past have been:

Her almost breaking up with me because she assumed that I couldn't cook, even though I can.

Her thinking I was cheating on her because I smiled when I sent a friend a message on Facebook.

Her thinking I was catfishing her because her friend stopped talking to her on Facebook as she walked into the room where I was using my laptop.

I could go on and on, but I think those three examples are enough to make my point. She has a tendency to be very snappy at times. If there's an issue, she won't communicate with me about it, but she expects me to be able to figure everything out and this can lead to arguments. Sometimes she will even try arguing with me while I am being calm and rational, refusing to argue back.

Despite this, we have never had a bad argument. We have never shouted at each other or made nasty comments to each other. Our arguments have been pretty normal, apart from the fact that the arguments could have been avoided if she had spoken to me beforehand. We don't even argue that often and from my perspective there wasn't a problem.

She is aware that most of the arguments are a result of her lack of communication or mood swings but, after not speaking for a few weeks due to her university commitments, she has decided that she wants to break up because we 'sometimes argue'. There wasn't a problem before we stopped talking and she was completely happy in the relationship.

She has given other reasons for the breakup, but they are also things that aren't worth breaking up over.

One of these is a complete misunderstanding as she assumed that I wanted to be a freelance cameraman when we moved to another country, where her family live. She knows that this line of work won't pay enough money there and she falsely assumed that I would not take any other kind of work. I am even working in an admin role now, which I have worked in in the past. I also tried to get a job in the country we were moving to and I was immediately successful, but she told me not to take a job there until next year due to a change of plans. Unfortunately she is worrying that I won't find work when I move.

Another issue for her is that she is worried that I am hiding something from her. She thinks this because, when I am doing something football-related, I don't talk about it with her in great length. This is because she has no interest in it and I don't want to bore her. Not because I am hiding something. In the past she has also convinced herself that I am secretly married with kids. This came out of nowhere and the idea only got into her head because she has heard about these things happening to other people. Things like this happen all the time, but I am used to it and it doesn't make me love her any less.

I know what she's like and what has happened here is she has spent weeks worrying over these things, along with other issues, without talking to me or anybody else about it.

I have tried telling her that we need to speak about this, but I can tell that she doesn't want to. I've explained to her that every couple argue sometimes and I have told her that I am looking for another admin role when we move and that my plan is not to be a freelance cameraman out there.

While it might sound like she has lost feelings, according to her family, she has been crying because she hasn't been speaking to me, while she told me herself that she cried at the thought of never seeing me again. She has also been looking through pictures of us a lot.

All she keeps saying to me is that she has made up her mind and she won't change it, but the reasons are definitely because we sometimes argue and she thinks that I won't take a permanent role when we move.

Obviously these things are not worth breaking up over, but what can I do to convince her of this?",0,0

But right now it seems I might be with one of the rare bipolars who aren't capable of being faithful.

My wife cheated on me in the past and planned many ""escapes"" and all night-ers and drinking binges in the past. 


And she did all this armed with nothing but a cellphone. She also had life changing talks on this cellphone with me and arguments with people on this cellphone with resulted in the destruction of a lot of her relationships/friendships.

She hasnt had a phone for the past 8 months and I was glad because her phone just seems to worsen her bipolar symptoms.

But...
She came home today with a brand new cell phone. Despite me telling her I did not want her to have one because of all the terrible things which occured when she had a cellphone in the past.

She insists that things will be different this time. She says she wont use her phone to flirt or cheat nor plan outings behind my back.

I have no idea if shes being truthful.

1791,4zmnid,Pleaase help me understand my BPD ex girlfriend,"I met a girl about 3 yrs. ago, she was married for 18 yrs. with 2 teenagers. When I met her she was on very high sleeping and anxiety meds, she brought a lot of baggage with her, like family drama, divorce/kids issues but I accepted her and helped her unpack. Her family hated me and constantly tried to separate us thru different games. One day, she stepped out for bit and came back to find her kids gone w/their furniture and she had no clue. She calld me and I helped her day/night thru that crushing time and she moved in with me.
We started having our own issues like any couple, and during the 3 yrs she left me about 10 times. I would come home from work and she with her furniture would be gone. Than I would text her to find out what happened at that specific time and it ranged from our arguments to her family telling her stuff to leave me. However, next day she would move back in apologizing and crying. I started school which took most of my time and she would complain about it, I would ask her to watch TV, go out do something but she would just sit on the couch and not do anything unless I did it with her. One day out of the blue she tells me, she is going to mexico for a week bcz I was busy with school too much. I told her if she goes like that I don’t wanna be with her. She went anyways but next day I got 100 calls/texts with her crying saying help me, I have BPD, this is a manic attack and that’s when I first found out about it.
I forgave her, she came back, promised to go to a doctor and get it treated which she never did. About a month later I found a paper in the scanner and it was a rental agreement, so I confronted her and asked are you moving out, her answer “well, it is what it is” I told her you people are snakes, normal people don’t do this, how many times are you going to do this to me and left the house, she sent me many messages again explaining manic episodes and apologized and cried like hell. I forgave her again. About a week later she said needed help with money, I agreed and then one day I asked her if she can try another way to help us out and I got a really bad gut feeling on her text reply. Next day I went to school and got a text from her saying, this is toxic I am leaving in 2 days…
She looked normal when I got home, I accepted her decision, and 2 days later she took 3 yrs worth of pics, greeting cards etc threw right in the garbage and while moving out she was happy, laughing like she didn’t even know me. Never said any good byes to my family nothing at all, Just so happy that I couldn’t believe it. 
I didn’t know how to deal with it so I texted her after and w/o saying anything about BPD, I apologized for my mistakes in the relationship which she enjoyed and she said sorry for hers, never told me the real reason behind it. Whats weird is that she sounded extremely happy, started telling me she bought a 60 inch TV, A ps4, got 2 cats, a bicycle, gym membership same week and was sending me pics of all this and kept saying I am so happy, I am moving on making it look like I was the bad one. I don’t know what all this means or if it’s even normal for a person to get all this stuff like that. She remembered nothing me and family has done for her. Her family and kids that left her and I went to help and take care of her, mow were all good to her and I was the bad one is what she said… Will she ever realize what she has done???

1801,4ewxnw,I strongly suspect I'm bipolar but not in a position to get a diagnosis. Help?,"First post after a few months of lurking. Hi. This is going to be long, sorry in advance. 

In February I tried taking the steroid Pulmicort (I can never remember the generic name) for asthma management. It made me have a 2-3 week hypomanic episode that ended once I stopped taking it. I don't remember February very well at all, but I somehow was functional enough to breeze through two job interviews and land a job, so...probably not full mania. 

But during that time I happened to come across an online bipolar assessment while researching something else. And it said there was a strong possibility I was bipolar. (Granted, steroids often cause manic symptoms, but my maternal grandmother does have a manic depression diagnosis...)

I have GAD, but for awhile now I've felt like not all of my symptoms can be readily explained by pure anxiety. I was on buspar for a year and a half, then petered off during the onset of a depressive episode (not helped by buspar making me numb and lethargic on top of my lethargic, non-functional depressive episodes). I think my GAD is well-managed, however.

I think I’m more prone to hypomanic(?) bursts(2-4 days) than depression. When I’m hypomanic I work on writing and art more (tho my art quality takes a bit of a hit because I go fast so I can get to the next thing I want to draw), I can’t sleep even after doubling down on my sleep aid (melatonin 3mg), then I stay up until I crash, then the crash only lasts like 4-6 hours, and then that turns into my sleep being irreparably messed up unless I’m *forced* into a normal-ish sleep pattern (school, part-time job).

Even then, I still have a LOT of trouble regulating sleep. I also have this compulsion to start arguments with people (I've improved over the years but it's still present). Otherwise I’m pretty functional? I have a BA in English (minors in greek & classics) and I'm in a long-term relationship.

I get depressive episodes about once a year during late spring/early summer. I have the same sleep patterns as when hypomanic except it’s because I’m too depressed to move from my chair. I don’t really eat or drink. I bathe only when I feel too disgusting to think about anything else. I’m bored. I get hit with a bad case of the stupids/brain fog. Often I get suicidal, but not always. 

When I’m not depressive though I don’t otherwise have symptoms of depression excepting the time I was on buspar? My friend (who has MDD and takes Prozac) had a hard time understanding how severe these phases are for me when I tried to explain it…

I’ve started keeping a basic mood chart but I’m not sure if it’s going to be helpful because my writing is sooo baaad. I want to get assessed & all the physical exams done, but my parents aren’t so accepting of mentally ill people and I can’t drive (I’m 22). I have a part-time job that would give me consideration if I had some sort of diagnosis and my schedule is pretty rigid (library assistant at a comm. college). 

I guess my question is what else can I do to prepare for a future assessment/get help before it becomes a crisis situation? Again I'm sorry for the long post but I'd rather lay it all out here than have to explain to individual commenters...

Things started to get better almost immediately, but it was a rocky beginning to say the least. I was rapid cycling more than I ever had, experiencing extreme bought a of anger, depression and mania. It began to level put once I upped my dose from a quarter the full dose to half after two weeks, but this is the second week of that and I noticed myself slipping into a depression. 

I guess I'm just panicking. I really don't want to to be investing this much emotion into whether the medication will work or not but I'm just desperate. I can't help but fixate. 

I know the medication is probably working, and I know I will still probably get episodes infrequently once I am at the full dose and stable, but I can't help but go to a bad place right now.

It is my source of income, but way more importantly: it makes me feel good, it is my hobby, it is my contribution to society, it is what my life makes worthwhile. My mind is occupied with my work 90% of the time, because I love it sooooo much. 

However, I am learning the hard way that my work *can* do me harm. I've been hospitalized twice and that had at least in part to do with my work schedule and the fact that I don't do recreational stuff that much. Don't take time off for holidays or for doing sports. That has bitten me in my ass!

Today I went to see the company doctor to discuss how am doing  now after my recent hospitalization last December. I honestly told her that I am not doing fine yet, but that I'll get there eventually. I am taking extra medicine. I going to do psychotherapy. I only work for 8 hours a day now and I work out. But she told me that I should seriously consider going partly on disability.

Disability?! WTF? There is no way on earth that I am going partly on disability. I can't have children, because I am sure I will be a horrible mother. I am not good at holding on to relationships. My work (and friends and siblings) are my reason to live. I'd rather drop dead than giving that up.

Instagram model (w/ 915k followers and rapidly rising) embarks on an aggressive Instagram campaign to show that there's more to life...than Instagram. She not only re-captioned all of her Instagram pictures to prove this, but posted YouTube videos lecturing her fans about it.

She has over 915,000 followers at the moment, in the the wake of having an identity crisis or revelation about the meaning of her life (supposedly BEYOND social media and her ocean of adoring, envious, and fapping fans)...and is documenting it very loudly and dramatically (...on social media, obviously, to her ocean of adoring, envious, and fapping fans). There are all sorts of questions: Is it all an contrived act, a performance for more attention? Is she bipolar and just torpedoing a massively lucratively career as a model, a mainstream celebrity, and a brand ambassador? Is this going to disillusion some of the general public from being interested in pictures of beautiful skinny young blonde white women?

I know that we care about each other very much, but sometimes it's hard not to take it personally when he is feeling really down and refuses to see me.

I give him his space and the next day everything seems to be fine, but I'm afraid that one day it won't be. I just wish he could see what I see in him, he's amazing in so many ways. I am not bipolar, and I will never be able to understand why he feels the way he does, but it is emotionally exhausting when he constantly rejects my attempts to cheer him up. I appreciate that he shares his feelings with me but it hurts to know that no matter how hard I try I will never be able to make him happy. I guess what I am trying to figure out is if it is better for me to be less involved. I know I care too much to fully remove myself from his life but he can upset me so much sometimes, make me feel and act much different from my usual positive demeanor.

1815,3jv7uq,"I'm not Bipolar, but I love someone who is. And I'm frightened it will destroy me.","If this is a bit long-winded, know that I've tried to make this as succinct as is possible.

I have reached such a point with my significant other that I have absolutely no idea what to do. I am entirely lost and mostly without any vestige of hope. 

A brief history before I explain: I am 30, she is 27. We have been together, more or less, for a touch over 3 years. She left me for two months at the very end of 2013, but then we reunited and resumed somewhere close to where we had left off. Getting back together was rather difficult for me, but we hardly had time to examine what had happened. More on that in a moment. We originally met in the summer of 2009 and dated for about 3 months before she left me for her recent ex. Shortly thereafter, she had a child, whom is now 5 years old, with her then (and now) ex (There is a long and significant story about this, which is important, but would be too long to include). He's an absolutely wonderful kid and I treat him as if he were my own. 

Shortly after re-uniting in January of 2014, she started bringing up the idea that we should have a child together. We would speak about it on occasion, and I was admittedly reluctant. She had just left me, packed up herself and her son, and moved out of our house. Having a child with someone felt (and still feels) like the grandest commitment one can make to another human being. I wasn't ready for that just yet, still stinging from her jaunt into singledom and my miserably solitary winter (to compound the matter, I also lost the ability to see her son when she left, which was a terrifyingly difficult adjustment). 

After some conversation, and some pleading on her part, we made a somewhat impulsive decision to try to have a child. It didn't take much time. Within a few weeks she was pregnant and due in December. 

The following 10 months or so were generally good. The pregnancy moved along without any issues, and as the year whittled away, the anticipation grew. Her ""issues"" were generally mild when present and whatever arguments there were must have been trivial as I have much difficulty recalling them. Save for a few explosive moments, and maybe one semi-prolonged stretch, she mostly maintained a sort of equilibrium. Further, she was pregnant with our child and thus the most beautiful person on earth to me. I had a very difficult time seeing any wrong in her then. 

In December, our son was born and suddenly life had a brilliance about it that I long doubted possible. The center of the universe abruptly shifted from wherever it had previously been to our son's lap. Life was new. 

Then the New Year rolled in and she began to change. Regress, maybe? I'm not positive. But whatever happened began like a spark on a dry, little leaf and now more nearly resembles a wildfire bearing down on my psyche. My question now is really only about how to survive what is happening.

Thus far I've refrained from noting what her particular habits and behaviors are that relate to her bi-polar condition. If I'm using improper nomenclature, I apologize, there's a certain nebulous nature to the words used to describe psychological maladies and I don't intend to mislabel or denigrate anything, here. 

She is diagnosed bi-polar. She has great difficulty much of the time taking care of basic responsibilities; hygiene, finances, cleaning up after herself, getting to work on time, helping to take care of the children, eating, etc… No responsibility is without an increased degree of difficulty for her. And I have mostly been able to handle this without too much stress. So I pay a bit more for our general expense than she does, even proportionally. So I do the dishes 12 times for each time she does them. So she hasn’t showered for 6 days; deal with it. But the sum of it all has brought me to a very weak point, and what she has been doing on top of not handling these responsibilities has made it seem as if I can no longer bend, but probably fracture. Mind you, this is all cast in the light of raising an infant, which is a constant and every day responsibility with very few breaks. A wonderful, but demanding measure.

What has happened this year, beginning in January and continuing through today has been, exactly, a progression. A progression soaked in so much clarity that is has been impossible to miss.

It began quietly through January and picked up a little pace in February. She began to spend less time with myself and our son. She began to neglect a few more responsibilities around the house than usual. She began to head out a little more often at night and either come home drunk or not come home at all. This pattern was not so oddly interrupted every other week when her eldest son would be with us. While he was around, she would keep some things in check. When he returned to his father's house, she would immediately slip off and the problems grew. It was as if she felt a responsibility to her eldest son, but not to the other two of us.

Our son had begun attending daycare by this point, and even though it was on her way to and from work, she would never drive him there, pick him up, or prepare his bottles and supplies for the day. Of the first 50 or so days he attended, she made possibly 2 trips to the daycare, while I made probably 98 (the daycare is in an opposite direction from my morning commute to work - anyhow, we had agreed to split the responsibility equally). And each morning, I'd get him ready and prepare everything while she either slept in or hadn't even come home from the previous night. 

She began to stop coming home from work. She'd send me a text as she left work at 5:00 PM which read something akin to ""running out to the store,"" or ""just going to say hi to my sister, see you later."" What these phrases actually turned out to mean was: ""I will be leaving work, going directly to the bar, drinking for much of the night, and crashing wherever I happen to end up between 12 and 3 AM. And also, from the moment of this text, I will be completely unreachable, so don't even bother calling. I won't pick up.""

This at first happened once or twice a week. By the beginning of April, it was 3 times a week. And by the end of the month and onward it became regularly 4 nights each week. Those are just the nights she didn't come home. There were many nights in between where she came home once we were asleep for the night, or came home drunk or high and simply went to sleep.

All the while, we had a ""newborn"" to take care of, and eventually an ""infant"" to care for. For a period of time he needed breathing treatments to treat a bronchial condition. They were rather difficult and sometimes she'd be gone enough in a given week where she'd never assist with them. There were 5-day long stretches where she may have seen him for at most, 3 hours. 

By choice. 

Not because of pressing responsibilities, like work, or family, or travel, or school, or what have you. Because she simply preferred disappearing at night to a bar and eschewing the responsibilities of parenthood.

As my frustration, my distrust, my anger, my disappointment all grew, we began to fight much more often. I couldn't really hide the contempt after a while, and when we would fight about what she was doing, her desire to do it again grew even stronger. (I use to contend to her that it felt something like having a stranger walk up to you, punch you in the jaw, and then when you started to get upset about it, he would punch you again, even harder, simply for getting upset about it).

It all sort of reached a head in June when she took off on a Saturday morning to stop in to work for a couple hours; she was supposed to be home early, maybe around noon. I had a lot going on in the afternoon and she knew this. After changing plans quite a bit throughout the day, 4:00 rolled around and she was not home. Very shortly after a text, she shut off her phone for the remainder of the night. The next morning she showed up around 10 AM. She informed me that she had gotten really drunk and decided to drop acid with a few people and crash at their place. Evidently, there was one person with them who did not trip and instead took care of the 1-year-old child that was around them. She apologized lengthily the following day, and committed to not drinking any more. However, that promise didn’t last long, and then she ended up leaving me again a few weeks later for what turned out to be 3 or 4 days.

She had so significantly stopped caring about the family we had just started that it had torn a hole in my gut and I had no clue how to not feel despised and unloved and neglected.

Since June, she has reduced the frequency of the disappearing, but not the severity. And it has become cyclical, where a certain depressive episode will trigger an aftershock of disappearance which manifests in the form of some cruel apathy; it feels abusive and intentional at times. Strike that. It is intentional at times. There is a definite sense that sometimes she takes some pleasure in vanishing completely and without warning, as though it is a heralded act of defiant rebellion against oppression. I just want to rely on her. I just want her to care about us enough to communicate what is happening. I just want to know that she takes our life together with the children seriously. I want to know that she won’t disappear without so much as a word for three days in a row.

It was always chance on how she'd respond to my unhappiness at what had been happening. Sometimes she would apologize profusely and promise that she would make attempts to do better. Sometimes she would acknowledge that the things she was doing were wrong, but say nothing further and show no emotion. Sometimes she would get vindictive and explain to me that the only reason she disappeared so much and didn't help out with anything is because I was such a terrible asshole and was always mad at her about something, so she had to get the hell away. Sometimes she would zone out so entirely that she would not move from a position for hours. Sometimes she would just melt into nothing and take the next day or two off of work and lay in bed. Sometimes I believed that she had more in common with someone labelled ""Borderline"" and that her actions were tinged with a certain apathy and carelessness that bordered on sociopathy. Sometimes the arguments would end with her declaring that she would kill herself and she'd run out of the house and into her car and drive away. I'd be left in a panic, entirely unsure of how seriously I should take the threat. For the hours that follow that, I’d be a wreck. 

Throughout this period of time, we discussed the possibilities of her either seeing a therapist again or taking medication again. 

She very nearly rejects the notion of medication out of hand. To her, it is typically a non-starter and she explains that no medication has worked up until now, so why would it work this time? The medications she was on made her feel like a zombie anyhow. (As an aside: she did have a very questionable psychiatrist whom had her on a 7 or 8 drug cocktail of anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, benzos, lithium and I don't even know what else; it was malpractice, I’d contend, and she eventually tried to overdose on them). Regardless, she might be so opposed to medication that nothing will convince her. Even if the alternative is destruction; of relationships, of love, and in the end, of self.

She had seen a therapist whom she felt comfortable sometime during her pregnancy or before it. I have asked her on numerous occasions to call her to schedule an appointment, and she pays the idea lip service but continually finds a reason to not do so. 

I have reached a point where I believe that I am unable to help her and that she is unwilling to make any real efforts at changing the current trajectory of our life together. If there are avenues for help outside of therapists and medication, she also seems unwilling to pursue them. She appears to have decided that things will go as they go, up and down, circling and repeating into perpetuity until it runs its natural course and either magically resolves itself or else ends in massive emotional turmoil or suicide; which she has legitimately attempted on numerous occasions, though not in about 3-1/2 years or so. That one put her in a coma for a number of days. 

The thought of leaving her is traumatic for me. Though lately, and almost shamefully, it has been a peaceful thought. I don't want to abandon her. I don't want to give up on her and leave her to her own devices. Above all, I don't want to put our son through a life of difficulty and force him to have two separate parents in two separate places. I've seen the effect it has had on her eldest son, and he has emotional issues directly related to it (and others probably directly related to her absenteeism during a portion of his childhood). I also can't fathom the idea of splitting up and seeing my son less often when I've essentially been his primary caregiver for these first 9 months of his life. I am devoted to him and I can't stomach the thought of losing time with him because she has been unable to be around and care and be responsible. 

I don't want to leave her because I still love her. 

Even after being left 3 or 4 times. Even after the emotional abuse. She and her eldest son are responsible for me turning my life around at a critical point. Without their presence, I don’t know that I’d be doing very well today. 

But it has grown to the point where I cannot rely on a single thing she says. I will see her on a Monday, completely motionless and mired in apathy, and I know that by Wednesday she will be vanishing over the next few nights and that by Sunday we will be fighting about it to such a degree that all reason and rationality is lost. I can see what is going to happen 10 days ahead of time as soon as a particular mood falls over her, and it’s happening with clocklike regularity.

The stress of it all has just begun to take a physical toll on me and I’m having some difficulty sleeping and eating. I’m not focusing on things as well as I should. I fall behind at work. I don’t have the time or energy to engage in things which bring me pleasure (music, reading, study). I’ve begun to develop pains that are stress-related (chest & muscle pains). Some weeks I practically wait for her to quietly say “fuck it” and start to unravel. Even if things are okay, there is a pallor about everything, knowing it will all degrade quickly when she decides that it ought to.

If you’ve read this far, thank you for taking to time to understand this situation. I’ve left much out and it is still incredibly long-winded.

I have no idea what to do. Keeping the interests of the two children in mind, trying to keep her stable, and trying to keep me from burning out, I simply can’t solve it. I can’t manage it all, right now.

I feel like a single parent some days. I awaken each day with the expectation that the responsibilities of our life will be shared only to be let down before I’ve had my first cup of coffee for the day. The expectation that she will be there and share the responsibilities is the thing that hurts when it goes. 

I wouldn’t be here writing this today if she had exhibited a willingness to work on these problems and find some type of a solution. So far, she has been decidedly resolute in simply letting things be and “trying harder” when she can manage it. It typically appears that she has no intention of honestly addressing her issues and their consequences. Her answer to much of the problems is often simply “I suck.” And I try to get her past the self-deprecation and not let her put herself down, but I’ve learned that this is simply her way of thinking about things in the simplest way possible and washing her hands of the responsibility for it. It ends the conversation every time. All I can say is “That’s not true, but I need your help.”

We’ve discussed the nature of post-partum depression and she’s explained that of course that’s present, but really it is just the standard issue depression she has dealt with all of her life which just so happens to be taking place after birth. There is no discernable difference between “post-partum” depression and the depression which accompanies her condition anyhow. 

I suppose half of what I hoped to accomplish was to put this down for the sake of compiling my thoughts. 

The other half is to seek guidance and advice from individuals who may have experienced similar situations. 

Do I end it and begin to move in a more positive direction for my son and I? Do I stay and keep pushing her to get help? Do I force the help on her? Is that fair or even possible? What should I try that I have not tried before?

I’ve tried to examine myself over this past year and determine exactly what I’ve done that could be causing these issues. And I’m certainly flawed. As the year has moved on, I’ve become much less patient. I’ve grown more combative and vitriolic. I’ve taken more offense each time and been less and less willing to see her as a person with a serious condition. I’ve gone so far as to demand that she simply grow up and act like an adult and take care of the things which need to be taken care of. Many of these things are counter-productive in approaching her. But I am so deeply hurt at this point, I no longer know how to react gracefully and with perpetual patience. I cannot maintain poise when thinking about what she routinely does. It is just so incredibly hurtful. 

I’m in a very difficult position. I never thought I would find myself here, debating whether or not to leave the mother of my only-9-month-old son. He’s hardly been around and already I’m thinking about shaking up his world and giving up on his mother. I hate giving up. I never do it.  

I’m scared this will shatter my will. I’m scared that I will expend so much time and energy in dealing with and managing this situation that one day I’ll look back on a life which was only ever about maintaining. I’m scared I’ll develop a higher likelihood of stress-related disease or illness and punch of out life far too early. I’m scared that one day she’ll just decide that she’s had enough, kill herself, and leave a wake of destroyed psyches and a pair of motherless sons. I’m scared that she’ll never want badly enough to make life better and will settle for the grand difficulty of this condition and, left untreated, all that entails.

To those whom even peripherally understand a situation such as this, your advice is warranted and welcome. To her, who may or may not see this here; please speak to me about these things. Nothing I've written is a new thought to you, and I wish you'd talk to me about what we can do. Our conversations end up one-sided and I feel as if you simply don't want to think about what is happening.

I kind of expect Bipolar II patients to have sudden swings but as a BP I sufferer, my understanding was that I could expect to be depressed for months or years and then become manic overnight.  Not enter into a near vegetative depression overnight.

I would say I've been mostly stable with some on and off moderate depression for two years now.  And in the past 48 hours I've hit my most depressive point in 10 years.  I've been practically vegetative.  Too depressed to eat food in front of me, too depressed to play video games.  All I've really felt up to doing is sitting in a chair and staring at the wall.  Occasionally I'll start to cry but it just kind of subsides and I go off staring into space again.  My thought patterns are completely abnormal.  I think to myself that if only I could go soak in the pool downstairs...that would...fix something.  I used to black out and end up in strange places when I was depressed in my teens.  I almost feel like I might do that again if it wasn't 105 degrees out.  I'm normally perfectionist when it comes to keeping the carpet vacuumed, and the kitchen spotless but I haven't been able to bring myself to do dishes or take out the trash in days.  One thing that used to really help me when I got like this was to just color in coloring books for hours on end.  I don't have any on hand, but I wish I did because that's all I feel cognitively and physically capable of right now.

I just...expect this kind of emotional coma to come on over weeks or months.  Not days.  It almost seems like PTSD.  Now I do have PTSD, but it doesn't seem particularly relevant to this episode.  My boyfriend was diagnosed with cancer five months ago and I've spent the last five months taking care of him through chemo and radiation.  He's finally cured and finished with treatment.  I feel like this may just be a delayed emotional crash from the stress of taking care of him.  It's just strange to me that it hits the week after we're given the perfect bill of health.

1817,3gxviy,5 year LT relationship with bi polar girlfriend,"Im an average guy 40 years old, with 2 great kids from a previous marriage sharing my life with an attractive 33 year old bi polar woman. ( diagnosed bipolar 2) treatment over 5 years has been all over the place...

The good : She is beautiful, intelligent, funny.  She is creative and talented and when stable she is a light in my life.  I love sharing literature and music with her.  Her depth of knowledge and passion for seemingly small things is refreshing.  I love her.  I have taken care of her and her of me since 2010.

The bad:  without warning she gets erratic, she can stay up for days or sleep for days.  She can't keep a job, her,medical compliance is all over the place.   She is an addict in recovery.  We have had an impossibly long journey.  She is involved with my kids...her relationship is something like a fun aunt on the days she is good...and tends to be ""sick"" and sleep most of the time it's not good.

When she is like this ( and only then ) she becomes absurdly secretive. She makes plans to meet guy friends...usually because that's a sensitive topic and she avoids discussing anything that may have conflict when she is triggered.  Tonight she Slipped out without saying a word of where she went, or who with or when she will be back.  I suspect she met her brother, but for our relationship it's abnormal to not say.   She carries on long discussions with lots of male friends through social media and on her phone...mostly it's harmless, over the years there have been discussions that were too far for my comfort level.

I don't really mind that she talks with them except when they are obviously not interested in just being her friend...and she refuses to acknowledge this.  She has not a single girlfriend.  Past or present.  She was homeschooled by a religious and abusive non treated bi polar mother.

 I mostly mind the phone chats when   talking with these people cuts into out time together.  I actually have an almost physical reaction of anger at the sight of her phone sometimes.

I respect that lots of people have different relationship boundaries....I am a monogamous person and to me couples need to have honesty.  I don't care for the sneaking / lying.  I give and expect brutal transparency.  I tell my SO where I am going, who I'm meeting as a courtesy.

Sometimes she just witholds information.  Like a compulsive liar. Even mundane information...and to be frank sometimes she has nearly / secretly put herself in dangerous situations.  It makes me constantly stressed when she is secretive because mostly it's nonsense but through 5 years of treatment and substance abuse ...there have been times when that behaviour has put her in danger and our relationship in jeopardy.  Lots of times I've confronted her before she does something that she will regret and she ends up sleeping it off instead ...I hate thinking like I have to be on alert for ever.  Like she won't ever have permanent balance and hold her own life together.  

During these times I feel much less like a partner / boyfriend and more like a supervisor.  I hate that feeling.

I know that her behaviour comes during her triggered times.  I also know that her triggered times come from either conflict with our relationship or near any contact from her mother.  Sometimes I just avoid having any disagreement just to avoid her being triggered.

I don't believe she has ever been unfaithful.  She could have if she wanted to, but that part of her life has never really been out of control since she was much younger.  I suppose it's possible but I don't think so.   Before we dated she was in different relationships and I never knew her to cheat physically....although for my boundaries she has had long, frankly emotionally intimate discussions with past boyfriends etc

When it's good it's perfect.

Each time it's bad like it is tonight...I think how I don't want to do this for the rest of my life.   I just feel like I deserve to be treated better.

I just wish there was hope. I'm so tired of it...and even though she is the one with bipolar...I swear I am the one suffering from it.

I've been doing this for a week.  It's mostly therapy. They prescribed me Zoloft, which is an antidepressant, rather than a mood stabilizer.  I told them about my previous diagnosis, but they only see the depression right now, so they took this route. 

My wife is coming in for a family session.  It's not couples therapy, just a meeting to explain the behavior of people with mood disorders and the effects of medication, etc.  She isn't excited, and told me flat out that she probably won't say anything, but she's coming, which is a step in the right direction.  I'm just going to go with the flow.

1823,3clgif,Bipolar girlfriend cheating or just having a certain phase?,"Hello /r/bipolar,

I've been in a relationship with this bipolar girl for a while now and recently she had said that she was having a 'depressed phase' and would like to spend some time alone.
Now, this girl really means the world to me, I love her with all my heart so I decided to agree and give her some time.

This was 2-3 weeks ago.

I just left her alone and assured her that whenever she wanted to talk about something or if there was anything bothering here she'd come to me and we'd talk about it.

The only thing I would do everyday is ask her how she felt, if she was alright and say goodnight, she responded, let me know that she still loved me and that I shouldn't think she doesn't because she been so distant.

So a few days ago she told me she was starting to feel better again and that it'd be a few days at most she needed.
HOWEVER, I had seen her spending extended periods around what's supposed to be 'a friend'.

Now, I tried my daily 'routine' of asking her how she was doing and all that again, but she IGNORED me.

She played it off as if her phone was fucking around and she couldn't send messages, what I doubt since how can she update her 'status' and receive messages when it really would've been offline? 

Now she has been spending the ENTIRE day, doing all kind of stuff she refused to do with me 'because she didn't feel good because of her bipolar kicking in' with this one 'friend'.

What is this supposed to mean and is it common with bipolar people?
I hope it's not what I think it is because that'd break me, and I don't understand why either... I'm always there for her, I want to do anything to make her feel better... Yet I think she lies to me about loving me still and secretly is cheating with that other 'friend' she spends more time on a day with than with me in the past 3 weeks.

1824,3c8jkt,I feel like my diagnosis is wrong. Looking for opinions.,"I recently went through a major depression that lasted probably a couple of months, and then immediately switched to feeling so energetic that I was uncomfortable.  I had the racing thoughts, and I was moving around A LOT more than usual.  I get filled with a thousand different worries.  However, that is the extent of what has been happening for the past week and a half, and it isn't constant.  It seems to start a little bit into my morning and may or may not go away later in the day.  I went to a psychiatrist thinking it might be bipolar II, but I wonder if maybe I was overreacting?  She put me on Seroquel XR, I'm 3 days into it.  

I don't think what I'm feeling is really hypomania.  It just doesn't seem to fit.  I seem to be sleeping normally (and not feeling tired all the time like I was before), I don't feel overly happy past the first few minutes, and I'm just scared that if I take these drugs when I don't need them I will start to feel some negative effects.

I've read of some people who develop a sudden sensitivity to caffeine, and might just be experiencing that.  I also wonder if I'm anemic or have a thyroid problem as both could explain some of the weirdness.  I'm seeing a general practice doctor on the 14th and will bring some of these things up.  I'm also going back to the psychiatrist on the 16th, and wanted some advice on whether I should call her before that and discuss my concerns?  I know I shouldn't just stop taking the Seroquel, but I am really worried about it.

I'll send him to the room to lay down for 5 minutes to cool off and he'll be back just fine.  He'll usually apologize and we'll go back to what we were just doing.  Yesterday was a bad day.

1829,39ql4k,Just realised that my mother has a bipolar disorder and I have made some few bad decisions. What can I do to better understand and help her out?,"Thanks for taking your time to read out and help me. Here is my story, I will try to keep it short.

So a few months back my mother almost cheated on my dad as she was suffering from some mental problems after suffering from depression a few years back when her mother passed away. Thankfully we realised in time to help her and my father (who works really hard night and day) help her seek medical help from a psychiatrist. 

Except from gaining a lot of weight from the medication shes taking, she seems really fine now (except for the occasional migraine) in fact I though she was back to normal. Except that today, her facebook account was still logged on and so I decided to check out a few message to see how shes doing. One of the messages said that she has a bipolar disorder and she was really improving and getting better until her son (me) gave her the news that he was going to Australia for a year. A few other messages (to different people close to her) said that she will really miss me and that she can't stop me from doing what I want as I have my own age.

Now going to Australia for a year in a few months time might not have been the best timing in the world, however it's something that I have been wanting to do my whole life and I already booked the tickets, visas and everything. Apart from assuring her that I'm coming back after a year or so, and talking to her at least once a week on skype, what more can I do to help out my mother?

I have a question. 

I was given latuda 40mg to try and speed up the mood stabilization process while trileptal is titrated into me. 

but now I have a couple issues: 

1. when driving, I cannot focus worth a crap. I try and stare at the car in front of me and I end up not being able to properly focus on it or notice the curves coming until they are in front of me. 

2. super hungry for no reason. yeah... 

3. random sleepiness out of nowhere / nap attacks.  this one is what is getting me.  I could be really awake and doing something and then out of nowhere it feels like I havent slept for 4 days and have to sleep for like an hour or more...

1840,30jyea,Fiance is Bipolar II Need Advice,"When I fell in love with my SO, I knew he was my soul mate. Everything was great, we just were so in sync about everything, and share the same future goals and want the same lives together. (a lot of animals, and a large garden etc.) I've never met someone with a bigger heart than him. Or who loved me for me and I could trust with anything. If I was stressed he'd try to cheer me up by playing beautiful piano and singing me love songs. I'm adding this all so that people do realize there is PLENTY I love about him before I get on to the problems. 

I don't think he has ever experienced manic symptoms and only has mild hypomania. He's never been a danger to me but we're still young so seeing so many horror stories about bipolar marriages scares me because I don't know if he's doomed to eventually progress into a manic stage one day etc. I apologize if this goes all over the place, but my brain is all over the place with everything going on.

Things slowly started to fall apart though when his school performance went to sh*t, his house became a disaster and he just got moody and didn't want to do anything. So because I cared (Trust me I know this isn't the right way to go about this now) I nagged the crap out of him. Which made him feel worse etc. I was concerned about him, he'd go days too lazy to feed himself, there was rotting food left around, he wouldn't care enough about finals etc. 

Basically long story short, he developed major depressive psychosis (I think I'm no professional so I can't say for sure) where he started hearing voices telling him he was worthless and should kill himself and that's when things really spiraled out of control and he started to withdraw from me and we broke up. That was a REALLY scary time because not only was I miserable that we broke up, but more than anything I was concerned about his wellbeing and suicidal thoughts. That pushed me to go to counseling and I started managing my controlling tendencies and also took a communication class that made me go from saying things like ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING YOU'RE THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY YOU DON'T CARE"" to ""Hey honey, I feel really worried when you lay around all day without eating because I want you to be healthy, would it be okay if we went grocery shopping to get you some more things around to eat?""

I basically fixed many of MY problems in the relationship so that even though my intention is still to help him, it's not coming off in a harmful way. When we broke up, we stayed in touch and specifically told each other we still loved each other. Which made it very confusing as to why he broke up with me. Later I found out it was because he felt he was a burden to me and wanted to save me from him. We talked it out and decided we never want to do that again, and this time we're going to take a healthier approach of tackling these issues.

He once told me he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 16 but it wasn't brought up again and I never understood what it really was. We both just assumed that it was a wrong diagnosis since he doesn't really have mood swings/we've never seen him get manic. After this really scary episode of psychosis and voices in his head though, I started to become worried he was becoming schizophrenic and after a lot of research found that what he was going through was very well actually bipolar disorder.

So now I'm at this point, where I'm healthy enough to communicate with him in ways that will work much better. He's still depressed, but considering the voices stopped, he occasionally has happy days, and he began crying every night he's getting better. That sounds odd to say, but from my own experience, when you hit the lowest depressions possible, you want to cry but can't because you're so hopeless, and I start crying more when I begin healing. He dropped out of college the last quarter, and in 2 weeks he's starting again. I'm nervous about him messing that up again. I'm nervous about a lot of things. His house is still nasty, but I gave up on that because it's such a low order concern. There's so many concerns so I'm trying to prioritize.

My priority at the moment is to get him to a mental health professional to get an accurate psych eval before anything. He's very resistant to medication and counseling and basically doing anything in this state so that's where I need advice. It's hard because in a situation like this, I feel like it's hard to not become a little pushy or controlling when I'm very much avoiding that. 

I'm willing to go through many hardships with him to have a successful and happy marriage in the future. But I'm so new to this all and am stressing like crazy. It doesn't help that my anxiety disorder (that WAS very much under control) is getting bad with this all. 

I guess I'll just list everything that is scaring me and stressing me the most.
I'm scared that he won't accept the help he needs. I'm scared that he'll have another bad experience with medication that'll make him into someone I can't recognize. I'm scared that his disorder will only get worse with time. I'm scared we can't have a successful future. I'm scared that he'll never be ""okay"" again. I'm scared that he will refuse to take medication. I'm scared that if he has to be on medication his whole life, he won't be who I've always known and loved. I'm scared that our relationship will become one sided where I do all the taking care of and work. That might sound selfish, but I'm scared that I'll be more of a caretaker than a wife. Don't get me wrong, I am completely able to deal with being extremely patient and taking care of him, being there for him, feeding him, pushing him to treatment etc. I just want it reciprocated a little bit and am scared that this disorder might make that request too big.

There's a lot of unknowns right now and I can't tell what I'm valid in being worried about, and what my anxiety is blowing out of proportions.

Any advice/successful bipolar marriage journey stories would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone could educate me about anything I seem to misunderstand about bipolar disorder, I'd like that as well.

1843,2uylka,First post at 1AM... here we go...,"When I was 14 or so a therapist suspected I was bipolar and prescribed me something and I didn't like it so I didn't take it. Here we are 9 years later, and after two failed relationships, moving from Virginia, to Boston, to Virginia, to Las Vegas, and back to Virginia, quitting 4 jobs without notice in 3 years, countless mood swings, and randomly destroying my life I've decided... I think she was right. However, 5 years ago they lifted the ""bipolar"" diagnosis and decided I had ADD instead and I've been on and off various dosages of stimulants for the past few years which I feel like have SEVERELY impacted my mood swings. 

Anyway, I have done a lot of reading on bipolar and read lots of posts here and finally scheduled an appointment for counciling as well as a therapist for medication. I have been going through a depression for about two weeks and just yesterday started noticing some mild forms of the ""manic"" symptoms I've experienced in the past... increased libido, actually replying to text messages, smiling, oh and pulling an all nighter and staying awake for 30 hours. Basically, I was doing something overnight and took one short duration 10MG generic adderall (the smallest dosage) at 10 PM, 3AM, and then at 6 AM. By noon it had worn off and I was tired but decided if I slept then, I wouldn't wake up until 9PM and then I'd be up again ALL night so I decided to just stay up and then go to sleep later around 9. By dinner time I felt like my eyeballs were going to fall out of the sockets because I was so tired but I stayed awake until 9 so I wouldn't wake up at an odd hour. I laid in bed and snooped Reddit and I felt this really weird tightness/throbbing in my neck which I've felt before but it never really bothered me so I didn't care. I was tired but was so wrapped up into Reddit I didn't even realize 30 minutes had gone by because I was suddenly becoming less and less tired. 10 minutes later I was 100% FULL BLOWN AWAKE AND EXTREMELY HYPOMANIC. I've been having these elated feelings of being completely invincible for years (I once paid $275 for Real Estate Classes and signed up for Portuguese classes online.) but to recognize it after reading so uch was really mind blowing. 

I am already actively seeking some help as my appointments are all coming up in March but my question is... of everything I've read I have never heard of anyone being EXTREMELY depressed for a period of time then suddenly feeling an OVERWHELMING bodily adrenaline rush and going full blown hypomanic within 10 minutes.  Like, I had to read up on dissasociative disorder just to make sure because the change in my mood was UNREAL. I have also read that bipolar disorder can be linked to hypothyroidism. I fluctuate between 90-98lbs (I'm a 4'11"" woman) and was once assigned get bloodwork done for my thyroid a few years ago but did not go because I am lazy. 


TLDR: Has anyone had any experience with hypothyroidism correlating to bipolar or extreme mood shifts in a short period of time with bodily sensations? Or is there an explanation for this? Please tell me I am not crazy.

1844,2tgoir,Hello everyone. I would like to share my personal experience to see if you guys could share your insights.,"I am coming here after self-diagnosing myself with bipolar disorder type 2. I know that it is probably very common for people to misdiagnose themselves with BPD because they do not fully understand the nuances and subtleties of the disorder. That is why I wanted to share my experience with you all to see if some of what I have dealt with sounds familiar. I am in pretty desperate need of help and so your feedback would be much, much, much appreciated. I will try to not make this unnecessarily long. 

I have been emotionally unstable since my early teens. Most adults around me attributed this to my Mother's death when I was 15. However, after much self-reflection, I believe that this instability has been an integral part of who I am since childhood. I am seeing a psychiatrist right now who has diagnosed me with ""adjustment disorder with mixed depression and anxiety"". If all of the pitfalls and bad-decision-making has occurred in my life because I have not yet adjusted than how long does ""adjustment"" take? I'm very frustrated, cynical and without much hope. I am now married with children. Now, the people I love are being implicated. 

Here is my long list of faults. Maybe you guys can sort through them to see if they some how resemble BPD2, or another psychiatric problem:

CHILDHOOD:

-As a child I was violent and hurt other children. At one point I was almost kicked out of preschool. I had tantrums more frequently than other children. 
-I would get angry or upset very easily and, as a result, would not enjoy family trips or things of that nature. Example: I would regret a toy I bought at Disneyland with my limited spending money and spend the rest of the day sulking, not allowing myself to have ANY fun no matter what.
-At times I was wildly creative, ambitious, enthusiastic and inspired. I had ideas for big projects constantly, and would have to beg other children to cooperate with me. 

ADOLESCENCE: 

-I was depressed almost always. I know that this is like the default emotion for teenagers, so I never thought much of it. I thought about suicide often, but not very seriously. 
-Sometimes I hated my peers. I thought I was much smarter than all of them. I thought I was a genius. 
-Other times I found friends that I adored for short periods of time. I would take them everywhere with me and want to be around them constantly. I'd get them to do spontaneous, somewhat destructive things like: ditch school to go to the beach. Sneak onto campus in the middle of the night. Sometimes I'd embarrass my friends by dancing spastically and singing pop songs in the hallways. Again, I realize that these things seem very typical for a teenager. 
-When I became angry or sad, I made a spectacle of myself. I poured milk over my ex-boyfriend's head in the middle of class. I started sobbing because my teacher suggested that if I found the work in AP Lit too difficult perhaps I should consider taking an honors class. Once, I was mad because a friend would not answer her phone even though we had made tentative plans. The friend who was with me told me ""you look really scary when you're mad"" which shocked me enough that I never forgot it. 
-I was curious about drinking and smoking, but thankfully I never really had access to it.

YOUNG ADULTHOOD:

-This is when any sort of emotional instability I has before was amplified by a factor of ten. 
- I went off to college, about 6 hours away from my family. I didn't make any friends. I either sat by my the window in my apartment chain smoking or drank myself to sleep. I became so depressed that I couldn't get out of my bed to go to class. I called my family members crying almost everyday. They told me to ""go join clubs, make friends, blah blah blah you can get through it, it takes time to adjust."" I felt like I really couldn't, and that I needed more help than socializing could provide. This was the first time I very seriously considered suicide. I formulated a plan. Figured out how to execute it. I decided that if my family didn't let me come home or start to take me seriously I would kill myself. Thankfully they did, and I moved in with my grandmother.
-After I came home, I drank constantly. I would go on 2am walks completely drunk by myself and sob in people's front yards. Alternatively, sometimes I would be happy and inspired and would dance through the neighborhood at 2am, also drunk. 
-I was taking classes at the local community college. My first semester went well. The second semester went down hill very fast. I found friends to drink with. I started skipping class. 
-Again, I sort of forced my friends into doing very destructive, spur-of-the-moment things. Take a midnight trip to Big Bear (we live in the LA area). Take a road trip to Colorado instead of going to school. Call in sick to work and spend half our pay checks going to Disneyland. 
-I was even more creative and ambitious than in high school. I had huge ideas for projects that I couldn't possibly carry out. I would, on a whim, decide I wanted to create a website about art. Then I would spend over a hundred dollars on a domain name and forget about it the week later.
-I had huge spending problems. Because my mother had died, I had tens of thousands of dollars in my bank account. Within two years it was completely spent on basically nothing. I bought things completely out of nowhere and regretted it later: a kindle, a laser-star-projector, 300 dollars worth of candy, an expensive evening gown even though I didn't have any occasion to wear it, meals for six friends at a time. 
-I also was sometimes extremely arrogant and vain. I thought I was the hottest and smartest person anyone had ever met. 
-I would start sobbing unexpectedly out of nowhere, sometimes in extremely inappropriate places. At work. In the middle of a house party...
-Sometimes I would lash out at my best friend or boyrfriend out of nowhere. I would become extremely angry and scream at them at the top of my lungs. They always attributed it to my drinking and drugs, as did I. My behavior was so unpredictable that it became a running joke. 
-I had suicidal thoughts frequently, though they weren't as serious as when I went away to college.
-My recklessness led me to sleep with my professor, and have a baby with him. These decisions were incredibly stupid. I thank fucking god that in my haze of bad decisions I accidentally found someone who was willing to marry me that is an extremely good, level-headed person. So so so very lucky.

NOW:

-My baby and husband basically saved my life. I don't ever let myself enertain thoughts of suicide for their sake. I am taking school seriously again and investing in my future because I can't afford not to any more. I do not do drugs and have kept my drinking to a minimum, though it is still a huge struggle. 
-Things should be wonderful right now. My life is stable and happy. We are financially secure, and I am surrounded by people I love that care about me. However, everything is shit because I STILL can't control my emotions. 
-My kids and my husband are being effected. ESPECIALLY my husband. He says he can't predict how I'm going to react anymore. He describes my unpredictability as ""scary"". When I get angry at him, it is for no reason. I become so livid that he thinks I'm going to ""lunge"" at him or ""hit"" him (though I never have). I come out of these bouts of anger feeling ashamed and guilty, not understanding why I was so mad in the first place.
-That is the way I experience most emotions now; they are extreme, and I feel like I'm sort of... drunk on them. I am in a haze of that particular emotion. And just like when you sober up from being drunk and regret all the things you did the previous night, I regret all the things I did in the haze of emotion. Sometimes the haze lasts for a day or two. Sometimes it last for several weeks. 
-The hazes are not always bad. There are hazes of ambition, inspiration, romance/ lust, motivation, excitement, or enthusiasm. I make big goals that I don't usually complete. Resolve to mend an old friendship (I never do), or imagine how amazing the future will be. My husband says that during these times I speak quickly, and am hard to follow because it sounds like I am just continuing a conversation with myself out loud. I become impatient, and must do things I'm excited about right that second-- whether its buying a new rug, making ABC flashcards for my toddler, or writing the thesis for my paper that is not due for a long time. 
-Currently I am very sad. I have to actively try not to cry. Yesterday I was very happy and energetic. I was super sexual and touchy with my husband. Nothing from yesterday to today has changed at all. 


Sorry if this all sounds a bit dramatic. I kind of got carried away. I don't think I've ever put all of this down at once, or really told anyone about these ""hazes"" in their entirety. 

Anyway, I'm at a loss for what to do. My behavior is destructive and hurts my husband and children. The SSRI's I've been taking (for the second time in my life) have no effect, except for a short-lived, hour-long feeling of euphoria when I first took them. I don't know whether something is wrong with me, or my life is actually really difficult in ways I can't perceive, or if I am just inherently an out-of-control person. Either way, my husband says my behavior ""is not normal"" and I agree. When I read about the symptoms of BPD2, they sounded extremely familiar.

1846,2rpvt2,Ways to deal with anger (unmedicated)?,"My doctor has pulled all of my meds, because I am pregnant.
Being pregnant makes me moody enough.  Now the anger is creeping back in.  The littlest things are pissing me off, and it's hard to stop being pissed off.  Plus, I don't like being mad so being mad makes me even more mad.  It's this big cycle of doom.  I was fuming for 2 hours tonight because I misplaced a notepad.  I tried breathing, I tried distracting myself, drinking tea, whatever.  One of my friends recommended meditation, deep breathing exercises, listening to calming music.  But she's not bipolar, she doesn't have any mental health issues at all, she has no clue how strongly a person can feel stuff.  A stress ball isn't gonna cut it when I want to destroy shit and set myself on fire.  Exercise sounds like it might be effective but right now I'm so exhausted and short of breath and sick that I can barely walk across the street without feeling like I'm going to pass out.  The doctor also took me out of work for the next 2+ weeks because stopping one of my meds causes horrible withdrawals so I won't be able to work anyway.  So basically I'll be stuck at home alone every day, pregnant and pissed off at dumb shit.  And once withdrawals kick in I will probably be confined to the bed, because I was the last time I decided to just cut my dose in half (and now I have nothing).

I do have a therapy appointment sometime this month and I can discuss this then, but I have no clue when the appointment is because I wrote it on that fucking notepad that I put somewhere.  Yes, I will call the doc tomorrow to figure it all out.  Also, it's a new therapist so I don't think we'll be working on ""issues"" right away, but more talking about all the life history crap I've been through with everyone else already.  Does anyone have tips on how to deal until I can actually get to therapy?

This is relevant for /r/bipolar because it has been shown that meditation can help with coping with stress which is a major trigger for bipolar episodes. 

His explanation was that the brain gets bored easily. What we do when we meditate it focus on one thing until the brain gets bored and then let it not focus on anything else. If we start thinking about something else we bring it back to the boring thing and bore it again. This means we are not stuck listening to all of our thoughts but instead can clearly hear just one and then that one can stop leaving us with silence. 

I'm going to try it and see how I go, I'll be working with my partner to help her learn too. Hopefully this works out well. ",0,0

1857,2der9c,someone close to me--not sure if he is bipolar?,"Years ago, someone close to me reacted extremely to an everyday event. He was 47 at the time. He found his wife's scarf and pants on the floor where she had left them after coming home the night before. Next to these clothing items was a children's book (belonging to one of their children). She had thrown the clothes on the ground randomly as she got ready for bed. The next day, he came to her in a manic state, saying, ""why did you do that? why did you do it?"" and she asked, ""what? what are you talking about?"" he said, ""in the bedroom. you know what you did."" she said, ""no, I don't."" He said, ""you know. in the bedroom. you know what you did."" She was so confused and didn't know what he was talking about, so she said, ""well show me--what is it?"" he led her to the bedroom and pointed at the clothing and book on the floor. She asked, ""what is it? What do you see?"" he said, ""You know."" 

For the following several years--almost a decade--this has come up again and again. He even said he has a photograph of it. He has brought it up time after time, never willing to explain what it ""means"" or what she ""did.""

Since that day, he has never been the same again. While some form of mental instability seems to have pervaded much of his life, this event sticks out. He won't explain why this was so ""bad,"" he just says, ""you know what you did."" Even in professional counseling, he won't explain the meaning of it. We don't know what happened or what is wrong, but he seems to think this was an extreme offense and we still can't figure out why, what it means, or what he thinks it means. 

I think it's worth mentioning that it's not that he is NOT extremely neat or clean himself--he is messy. So it's not that the mess offended him. Also probably worth mentioning that there has been some drug use in his past.",0,0
1858,2bk5id,"If you wanted to induce MANIA (safely), how would you do it?","I've always had an interest in web design and development. Over the years I've made plenty of sites. Mostly small little things, nothing too fancy.
It's gotten increasingly difficult to get *into the groove* and sometimes I feel like I don't really like it. However, I do, I really DO!

I have the occasional little motivational speech or routine that I go through, but it's not enough.
I was in the middle of a massive update two years ago on the most complex site I have ever created. Starting the site was a JOY. I was up all night, every night and I would code and design till late late at night. I'd guess I was MANIC the entire time I was working for Him. When He emailed me about anything site-related, problems, updates, etc. I had a solution within several hours. Didn't matter if I was in bed already. I'd get up at 12am, or 4am to satisfy His needs. Over time, I kinda lost steam, fell into a depression, and I was fired. My client has since moved on and I fear that that may happen to me - again!!!


So I'm thinking that the best way to keep from getting fired (again) is to whiz myself into a (safe) manic state, and get the job done.



**A LITTLE BACKGROUND IS IN ORDER**:

* 1. I stopped my meds over six months ago, against Doctors orders. He knows, as I told him a month ago. My wife is also aware and she keeps a close eye on me daily. I have been playing it safe. Eating healthy. Drinking lots of water. Limiting my sugar and caffeine intake. Sleeping well. And amazingly, I feel great!!! His office is located less than 2 miles from my house.
* 2. In the past, when I am manic, I get LOTS DONE (I'm sure you do too ;)). The last time I was manic, I started playing with Linux and stuff. I built myself an Arch Linux web server that I can access away from home :) I can SSH into from my smartphone. I then made the switch from Dropbox type services, as I now have my own personally hosted solution. That manic high lasted me almost two weeks.
* 3. I know what I'm asking for is dangerous, as most of you try to stay away from your mania. I'm not fearful of it, I'm fearful of the crash that comes WITH IT. The depression part. My lows generally last me a few days, but the highs can go for a week or two.

1860,23og4p,Bipolar Meds and Music Festivals,"**tl;dr:** How to you guys fit music festivals and gigs into your lives and schedules?  Dehydration, people in general and anxiety seem like too bit a barrier to overcome.

I love live music, I love the atmosphere, I love belting out tunes, I even love the sunburn.
Enter bipolar and bipolar medications, it looks like live music might be out of the question for a while.

I like small venues just as much, often better but they seem like they've been ruled out too.

**1. Alcohol**
I know some of you drink on your meds and I'm still undecided.  I drank this weekend just gone with no ill effects apart from exhaustion and a delayed hangover.  Also the shame of realising I can't cope going to a party without drinking.
Anyway, drinking at a festival to me sounds like a big N-O.  The amount of dehydration I'd be dealing with before alcohol even comes into the picture is a scary thought and there doesn't seem to be any way of avoiding it.
If I was to go to a small venue I wouldn't be drinking because I would be driving.  I really don't like that idea.


**2. People**
I haven't got anyone to go with.  I do mean that in all seriousness, I don't have a group of friends, there is no way my sister would be allowed to go (her hubby is a knob about this kinda stuff) plus she'd probably prefer to scrape her eyes out with a plastic spork than endure my music.

Obviously, I could go alone, right?  Well I'm 5ft flat and not the most aggressive soul in the world.  Being able to see anything beyond sweaty armpits involves me getting near the front - I don't mind doing it so much as festivals, even with the bone crushing.  At gigs, I'm a lot more conscious of looking conspicuous being a girl on her own.  I'm not saying anything bad would happen, but the walk from the venue to my car gives me shivers just thinking about it.

**3. Social Anxiety**
The groups I can handle, in theory.  The parts that get my anxiety levels sky-rocketing is waiting in line - it becomes obvious you are alone - and the idea of a train ride home.
Add to that the intense terror I would feel all day keeping an eye out for people I know so I can hide.  Plus the disgust about how whatever I'm wearing makes me look fat/albino/daggy/skanky.  Put all that together with the adrenaline of a festival, and I can smell the disaster from here!

How on earth do you guys deal?  I don't enjoy much and this is really starting to make me miss the old me.  There's one on shortly that I would desperately like to go to can just can't.  Camping alone just doesn't fill me with confidence.

2. Understanding from co-workers when I alternate between being highly detailed and then asking a question a second time, or double-checking something.

3. Infrequent unplanned breaks or a variable work day.

4. Isolation of desk from loud neighbors and kitchen odors (to avoid distraction)

2739,13xvk15,"Is Dating another Bipolar Person Advisable? If so, where would I look?","Hey guys!  I want to start out by stating my understanding is that there are rules set on this sub to prevent us from making friends, and it is not my intention to break them.

I’ve been having trouble with dating and have a hard time getting past beginning stages.  The initial strong hit of happiness I get from finding chemistry with someone makes my head spin, and my illness always ends up ruining good things before they can start.

I’ve been in a few relationships, and been in love with only 1 of those partners.  She was neurodivergent, probably bipolar.  (We were 16-17yo so I don’t have a lot of details on specific diagnosis).  She understood me.

2740,13xumx0,Embarrassed myself at work and need help,"I embarrassed myself with my behavior and not sure what to do. I work for a large consulting firm as a senior consultant. The last project I was on was not my finest moment.

The person staffed with me was not comparable. She was overbearing and you could not compromise with her. I quickly became overwhelmed, frustrated, and turned inward. 

There were times in the project where she would get frustrated with me and tell me . I had lashed out at her in an unprofessional but not sever manner. Throughout the course of the project there were things that people did on the project that I voiced my concern about. Once I was very brash and some I just sounded annoyed. I believed as me and here were peers we should handle it between ourselves but she always suggested I talk to a manager. 

Sometimes I would get so overwhelmed with how overbearing she was that I had to take pto unexpectedly. I also made a lot of grammatical mistakes and lost focus on my work products. They simply were not up to par. Fast forward the project ends and I am about to start a new one.

I start my new project and 8 days later I  get rolled off for 3 reasons that were never discussed with me prior and frankly were untrue. I had a feeling the person I worked with previously had something to do with it and my suspicions were confirmed when she was my replacement. 

As this is my livelihood and I did not do anything wrong to get rolled off I discussed it with HR who is aware of my diagnosis. 

Today I get a formal meeting request with the director and executive of our department for Tuesday. I feel for sure I am going to get fired. I am so embarrassed by the way I acted on the first project even if they don’t fire me is it worth it to stay ? I feel like if I do because of my past actions I will never get promoted or any raise. Can anyone chime in with their thoughts or shared how you embarrassed yourself at work to make me feel better?

2745,13xtaax,My cocktail: Remission achieved,"I've never posted here before, but I just got my prior auth for another year of rx, and I was just thinking that I'd share my cocktail in case in helps anyone. Background Bipolar NOS (also ADHD... maybe one manic episode, mostly hypomanic ones when they were in that range. Most of the disorder has been mixed depression, but I was always medicated with something, so i truly don't know how my natural state is. 

400 mg Lamictal XR + Aplenzin 174 + Synthroid .112  (hypothyroidism for many years) + Buspirone 20 mg (x 3 times/day) + Propranolol 40 mg (x 3 times/day; first dose is 50 mg)

I can't take IR lamictal because it wears off too quickly and I cycle rapidly. I can't take generic lamictal ER because the product itself is so bad that it hits me all at once (it even looks like a totally different pill).  Can't take generic buproprion hcl because I need the HBR. 

If not for the majorly good insurance (Cigna, from husband's job), I wouldn't be able to take these medications. This is like... 20 grand a year worth of meds. Lamictal XR is insanely expensive, plus it's 60 pills/month so it's double the regular cost of a 30 day supply. 

My only complaint is that I like to joke that I'm a fucking idiot. I say the wrong word A LOT. I don't tell stories well because I forget where I'm going, etc. I don't give a shit. It doesn't impact my large-scale cognition. I'm just... slower. This is the hand I'm dealt and it's better than the illness. I doubt most people who have never dealt with this shit would be okay living with the side effects I have, but we all know what the devil looks like and we know that these are NOTHING compared to the depths of hell of bipolar disorder.

Looking back at it, I was very sick. I actually had a job, though I couldn't really keep the same one for long. I'm married. I managed to keep myself out of the hospital (though frankly I should have been put there a couple of times). And I know it's just because I'm lucky and have social supports and good insurance and access to the best doctors, not because the illness was mild. I don't deserve that any more or less than anyone else, and I'm grateful.

I only got out of bed in the morning everyday because I knew there were more medications to try, so odds were that I'd eventually get better. I did, but I really think I have PTSD now from 7+ years of hell. I'm just recovering from severe DP/DR going back to the first manic episodes.

Hope that helps someone. I hope you all get to the day where you just forget you even have this shit and have more relevant things to consume your mind. I'd forgotten what it was like to think of ANYTHING else.",4,0

I have these thoughts where I feel like everything I think is known by everyone else and that they can hear what’s in my head. I also every once in a while feel like there are cameras and I’m being watched.

This is the point where I know that I need my meds changed and hope I don’t go psycho and need to go back to the hospital. 

I feel like I’m an absolute nutcase when I tell people that I feel like this and I know that it worries my boyfriend when I tell him these things. It’s not even that I’m hiding anything or have any reason to worry that someone “hears what I’m thinking.” 

Both of my parents are bipolar but haven’t gotten help. My dad definitely is paranoid… but we don’t really have a relationship with each other just because he refuses to get help and is a severe alcoholic so I choose to keep him at a distance just because he isn’t good for me or my mental health. Also he says he’s not paranoid he’s “aware” of the things going on around him. 

I don’t even know where I was going with this post. Honestly just a vent and to see if anyone else experiences this. I just feel like I’m on the edge of having a psychotic break again and that’s not something that I’d like to experience… for the hundredth time.

Update:

Before rapid cycling, I would have manias about once every 2 years and be depressed or stable, sometimes stable for 6 months or more. Since rapid cycling, I've had about 8 hypomanias and 3 severe manias, been hospitalised 6 times, sent to crisis houses, many meds changes, therapy, ECT.... Nothing is working any more. Lithium used to work a charm for a long time, suddenly it just stopped. I think it was related to me having my youngest kid but I don't know.
My team have provided me with carers because it's become clear I can no longer function living alone and need help. They have said that rapid cycling is rarely permanent, but it's often treatment resistant. They can't help me any more, there are no options left. They have told me to consider practicing acceptance - that this is just how things are and I need to learn how to live with it and around it. To accept I have a significant disability that affects my life deeply. But with that I can also accept that when I'm depressed, it will pass soon enough, and what's waiting for me at the end of that hellscape, is the outright bliss of mania. The cycle continues.
I'm upset because I'm losing my sense of self - I'm never stable any more, I'm forgetting who I am.

I (m/40+) started seeing a therapist a little over a year ago after I had a pretty severe episode that almost cost me my family. 

Fast forward to recent events and having an emergency session with him after what I can only describe as a manic weekend. Apparently I had never told him my mother is severely bipolar. This was a huge red flag for him. 

For background I have struggled with depression and thoughts of self harm. I've absolutely had manic episodes where my decisions were terrible and usually ended up at a huge financial loss. I've been to other counselors, and even had one suggest that it wouldn't hurt to get checked for bipolar (before COVID). My partner confessed to me that she absolutely has had suspicions for the majority of our 10 year relationship. 

So anyway, I asked my therapist what I should do and he said he has the ability to screen me and label me as bipolar 2, but wants me to go to my PCP for a referral to a psychiatrist/psychologist (?) for a bipolar 1 diagnosis so I can get medication. 

So as I write this I apparently have an official bipolar 2 diagnosis and I didn't even know that was a thing. 

It's rough to find out this late in life, and I never wanted to be like my mom, but at least now we have some answers about my erratic behavior.

I don’t know if I will ever find someone who loves me, for all of me, including my bipolar. 😓","**TL:DR** I’m in a few Bipolar/Mental Health subreddits and what I see bothers me. People say the same things all the time. It’s *always* about relationships failing due to someone with Bipolar. Recently, I’ve finally began to start working with my Bipolar and not against it - due to *the best relationship of my life* ending from the challenges I faced. I’m devastated with what has happened, the conversation at the end was the *saving grace* to actually force me to get the help I need and *be the change* I want to see in the world. I can’t help but sit and wonder though: even if I get the help I need, will there ever be a person similar to my ex who comes into my life and stays despite the challenges I will face from time to time? 😓

———

For *years* now I’ve been wondering why my relationships have continually fallen apart and have never lasted more than 2 months. I constantly questioned everything, (I got answers), but never truly listened and heard what was being said back. 

As time passed, I *very slowly* started to pick up on little things and better understand myself with what I was facing and doing to others around me.

It wasn’t until recently that everything *FINALLY* clicked into place... but unfortunately… it all clicked a little bit too late. 

This click derived from the person I’ve literally been searching for and waiting over the past 7 years of my life. This person was everything I could have ever wanted and more. I was quite literally handed a golden goose on a literal god d a m n silver platter. Everything to be right was right. Timing, similarities, interests, relationship style, even the graduation date were all the same and had no complaint ever about anything! There was literally nothing wrong with the relationship, it was the healthiest and best relationship I have ever been in… but I literally chose to self sabotage and find problems that did not exist because I absolutely refused to believe someone so amazing could come into my life. 

After losing this (I swear) once in a lifetime opportunity (that’s how *crazy amazing* it was), I am ripped to shreds, screaming in agony, with my heart shattered in a million pieces all over the floor.

———

This was the relationship that taught me I needed to change and actually finish what I started working on a while back. This was the relationship that taught me that I can be the person who I have always wanted to be, the change I want to see in the world. The person I was given showed me *MY STANDARDS DO EXIST!*

I have known about my bipolar, OCD, and Anxiety for quite some time now and have been lightly trying to work on everything to get to a better spot in life through medicine and therapy. It wasn’t until 7 weeks ago that I *REALLY* started working on it though… it was 7 weeks ago my heart took such an emotional beating and 6 weeks since the official break up. (During that breakup they expressed all the concerns about me and everything they said were the challenges I knew I was facing and actually admitted to doing wrong.)

———

I would like to *emphasize* that I am *ADMITTING* to all of my actions, accepting my failures, and growing from the mistakes I made through the challenges I was facing. 

I would only hope that through the amount of personal growth I have been experiencing over the past 7 weeks, that if I continue to work hard to overcome and understand this terrible mental illness, that someone will love me for me.

I only hope that someone that resembles my ex will hopefully come back into my life at some point as I continue to grow as an individual and give me the second chance I deserve after going through some very intense self reflection.

Ive been with my boyfriend for over two years now, and he has been aware of my mental health struggles and we talk about them frequently. 

He went on a weekend long trip to New York City with his guy friends to party and relax and have a good time. I have no issue with this, but when i was driving him to the airport he was being rude and irritable, and i ended up crying on the way home. The day before we were driving and I was holding in a panic attack and he said he thinks im 'begging for attention' and really just didn't understand or support. It made my feelings even worse, as I genuinely wasn't asking for attention, quite the opposite really. 

He comes back and we didn't talk for a couple of days, but he called me last night. Apologized for how he treated me on the way to the airport, but told me he doesn't know how long he can take of this, said he couldn't do it for another two months, and called me 'dead' multiple times. He says his desire is dwindling and he can't handle my mental health unless things get better within two months. 

I have a feeing in New York he talked to his friends for advice (which i am completely fine with and encourage) but they are all single 'players' who brought him out to clubs where he probably got a taste for what could be. I dont even blame him as i know ive been distant lately. 

Im really struggling and very alone as it is, I have no support system other than him as we moved cross country and have struggled to make meaningful friendships.

I'd been depressed for about five weeks and have developed a bit of a drinking problem as well. I had a hangover yesterday, so I didn't drink at all, but was feeling pretty crap the whole day. 
I had been up watching a show until past midnight, which after I told myself I had to try and sleep now—I had the prospect of going to work tomorrow, so I didn't want to sleep (I'd taken a few weeks off and was trying to force myself back—idek why because I didn't have to) but as I went to bed, I didn't feel so tired (even though I only had around six hours of sleep that day, which is not enough for me typically) and then I started talking to myself. A lot. I ended up talking about whether I'd prefer a dishwasher or a dry cleaner and all of the pros and cons to both and many other things I don't remember. Naturally, I'm thinking I'm coming out of my depressive episode and into hypomania. 

I think I fall asleep eventually for a while, but I wake up at some point feeling super anxious and seeing loads of flashes of very gruesome images. One haunting one is me laughing maniacally as my face begins to distort. I also saw a dead baby, incomprehensible bloody parts and a lot of creepy faces. I wasn't asleep at this point, I guess they were daydreams? I get the flashing scary faces when I'm trying to sleep sometimes, but this was particularly intense. 
My mind was cycling so fast through all of these images, and whenever I heard talking in these ""daydreams"" what was said never made sense at all. 

 I fall asleep and wake up many times during the night, and once, I'd gotten up in a panic from an unpleasant dream I was having with my heart racing. All the dreams I had were not nice.

2773,13x99s1,Australian medication problem,"Hey everyone.  If anyone is from Australia and have you experienced this. In regional areas and rural areas the current change in legislation by government is making it harder for medication to get to our areas. This is due to being able to get in bulk medication I believe. This sounds good but my pharmacist says he can only get me certain brands due to the fact of the shortages now. Pharmacist are struggling to get many medications now. 

Has anyone else been affected by this? I'm not having a go at the government but it seems this policy has backfired in a way that wasn't intentional. 

The different brands seem to be reacting to me differently and not doing as well as before. Especially the anti psychotic. 

Have a good day everyone :).",2,0

Now when I see someone who falls under those categories my mind just screams slurs. Sometimes I physically have to hold my mouth closed to stop me from saying them out loud. It makes me want to ball up and cry. Why me. Why is my mind just screaming at me. My psychiatrist just ramps up my lamotrigine but it only helps so much. Some of it is just me.

I attempted in March and was hospitalized for a week. Was met with so much verbal hostility from my husband when I came home. It hurts so much.

I think I’m in a mixed episode right now. Extremely agitated, paranoid that people are watching me and taking notes to get me involuntarily committed. Not really able to eat, unable to sleep but not tired, nothing feels real. Feels like if I die in this life I’ll just finally wake up from the dream and I’ll be normal. Since nothing matters anyway….. it’s been really hard to not do anything stupid. 

Feels like I’m drowning, slowly. During the big recent depressive episode, I would label the thoughts as coming from my “depression parasite.” That’s what it feels like, after all. Some foreign body in my brain trying to kill me. 

That parasite keeps nagging at me. Some days it is louder than others. Been really loud lately. I’m emotionally and physically exhausted. I hate standing at the sink trying to wash my face in hopes it’ll take away the suicidal thoughts. Feel so damn weak. 

People say it won’t always be this way, that it gets better, to have hope. I’m sure I’m just being delusional, but I truly can’t see a way out. This doesn’t go away. I don’t want this.

Now he’s in a new house, promoted, has a new girlfriend and all is right in his world. He found his happiness in 4 months. I’m left wondering how he could leave me at my worst knowing my struggles.

I have been seeing a therapist regularly for over two years now. With both we have focused on IFS. Internal family systems has helped me tremendously but I feel like it’s starting to harm me.

I do not feel in complete control anymore over my mental state. It feels like I have another version of me take over my mind and body. Now I am not having full blown episodes where I totally lose control but there’s a belief I have in my parts where they actually become and feel real.

I have one part who doesn’t want me to focus on my studies. In fact she wants me to focus on healing but instead of trying to help her heal, she won’t let me.

I get that we faced a trauma but I am ready to move on with my life and I cannot just stop everything because she wants to heal. 

I have finally reached my breaking point and cannot let her jeopardize my future. Even though she tells me I’m a genius and that once we heal I will get my brain back, I can’t do it.

Does this even make sense? That I shouldn’t continue with my studies but instead just blindly believe that my brain is broken and that by healing I will get my genius mind? Because it’s not making sense to me and it’s feeling like I’m having an episode when I’m not having an episode.",3,0

In any setting, I cannot stand to be alone. It makes me super paranoid to the point where I start having auditory and visual hallucinations. I’ve been here for a long time and haven’t told my superiors about this, because fortunately/unfortunately, I’m very high functioning. But I’m so tired of being terrified up here, it’s turning something that I love into an exhausting experience. I do have a second job which is actually where most of my income comes from, but not enough to support me, so I’m not in a position to drop either job right now.

2791,13x51o6,Feeling lost and frustrated with myself,"I'm  sure there are many threads like this, so I'll try my best to keep  things brief. But we'll see how that pans out, as the situation is a bit  of a doozy. Or perhaps, the much-feared combination of doozies. A  multi-doozy epoch, if you will.

At  the outset of the pandemic, I got laid off from a job where I had some  decent opportunities and great, supportive colleagues. I had a tough  time finding work after that - quotidian lockdown stressors, job  hunting, and maladaptive coping strategies sent me spiralling into a  manic episode where I had to be hospitalized... Obviously this was  world-shattering and terrifying.

I  spend the following year-and-a-half working a job where I feel totally  underemployed and useless. Once my contract runs out, I find myself in a  near-identical situation to 2020 after my contract expires.

Out of work -> bored -> depressed -> pot/alcohol -> funny farm for a few days.

This  time was much worse and I successfully scared the living shit out of my  partner and friends, only bolstering my sense of alienation further.

This  time, my manic behavior was so awful, that I had to move back home with  my parents due to the way I was treating my partner. The immediate  month out of the hospital I felt totally estranged from reality and  living back home brought to surface many reminders of why I moved out at  such a young age.

Some key things to note.

One,  I am aware that I am a fucking idiot - if insanity is making the same  mistake twice and expecting different results, then the shoe does indeed  fit well.

Two, my partner after  both episodes has chosen to stay with me. I am confused, yet eternally  grateful for that, but I will eternally feel guilty. So that's a healthy  dynamic, especially when talks of marriage are on the table (I have  suggested couple's therapy and she's amenable).

Three,  my experiences with my industry (biotech) have left me completely jaded  towards the field. Yet, I am at the moment pigeonholed by my  experience. I want to switch careers (IT/lab automation/data  science...I'm open to options), but I am completely at a loss for a path  forward. A master's degree seems most sensible, but where is the money  for that coming from when I'm currently unemployed and still saddled  with undergrad debt?

Four, I do  have a psych and therapist. Still unsure if the meds I'm on are right  for me though (wellbutrin+celexa: been equally interested and repulsed  by the idea of ketamine therapy or my skin potentially falling off via  lamictal).

Despite these  experiences, I am still at my core an ambitious person. I love learning  and desparately want to improve my circumstances, however as I get older  (28 now...) my preoccupation with past failures and acute awareness of  limitations set forth by Time (and how I've routinely mispent it)  hampers my motivation. Too many of my figs have gone black as I sit  paralyzed with regret and self-loathing.

I  have no schedule right now and every fiber of my being seems to resist  creating and adhering to one. Why? I can only guess, but as with other  failed attempts at self-improvement, it's most likely distrusting that I  will actually follow through with whatever my new goal might be. I  usually stick to a new habit for three days or so then just say 'fuck  it' and return to complacency.

7 Habits of This Highly Ineffective Person:

1. Eating/drinking alcohol out of boredom (for the record I completely quit pot, at least)
2. Joylessly masturbating multiple times a day and then self-flagellating over porn usage
3. Waking up to a 'PM' on the clock
4. Chronic procrastination vis-a-vis video games, half-assed engagement with hobbies, scrolling
5. Refusing to exercise and taking minimal action towards self-care
6. Engaging  with the world in such a negative, critical light and almost believing  that those who don't (aka those who are happy, or at least content) are  ignorant...
7. Leaving the door and windows unlocked for Comparison to come and go, looting happiness as it pleases

Awareness  of these issues obviously isn't enough, but I feel like I have so much  to overcome that overwhelm just pushes me from one shitty habit to the  next, creating the illusion of activity.

I  want to give up (or more realistically...severely limit my usage of)  alcohol, pornography, sugar, social media - essentially all those common  Opiate of the Masses types of things. And start exercising, reading the  hundred or so books on my backlog, reengaging with hobbies in a  thoughtful way. However, I just find a litany of excuses. Or in the case  of something like choosing a book from my library, I'm greeted with the  doubt that I'll finish it and even if I do, when's the next time I'm  going to find the motivation to read another one? Surely it's a futile  effort...(\*eyeroll reacts only\*)

I  want to exercise, oh but my bike is too small and I don't have the  money for a new one...What about body weight exercises? Yeah, I  guess...I don't have a yoga mat though... How about going for a walk  then? My neighborhood isn't very walkable and I don't want to drive  somewhere just to walk, seems silly.

I  want to improve my coding skills, but oh there are so many languages  and I'm too dumb to remember syntax and vocabularly, let alone  logic...Well you can just do what everyone else does and google those  things as need, plus didn't you take many advanced math courses in  undergrad? Yeah... but ever since my hospitalizations, I feel stupid and  incapable of remembering things.

I  want to be more intentional with my art, but well there are so many  more talented writers/musicians/artists out there and what are the odds  of getting exposure? Shouldn't the primary goal of art be to nourish the  soul or whatever? Yeah...but, I should be using that time to job hunt.  Yeah, I suppose, but you aren't, you're just in bed, playing Tetris 99  ad infinitum and listening to shitty podcasts...

I  just want to find the motivation to get back to work. Having income, a  place to go, a slight sense of purpose would improve my overall  situation greatly.  I have been searching for months and have landed  interviews, a handful going to final rounds, only to get ghosted at the  offer stage...I just feel less and less resilient with each setback. I  used to be strong and iron-willed - I would like that back.

Unsure  what the end goal of this post is, I could really go on for hours.  Perhaps it was just to force myself to get some of this bile out of my  body and onto paper. That said, I'm always open to thoughtful  suggestions and enjoy the comfort of shared experiences.",3,0
2792,13x4vdn,Went blind with rage and keyed someone’s car very badly and my rage episode just ended,"I (19m) had been fishing for 5 hours hadn’t eaten all day and was running on not much sleep, smoked some cones before fishing and bad 2 beers on boat (I hardly ever drink). I get back to the boat ramp in the dark, tie my boat up, walk up to get my car and trailer to find that someone had illegally parked in front of my car in the specifically signed “cars with trailers and boats only” when I was very clearly taking up the whole long parking space and it’s pretty obvious you can’t park in front of someone with no way for them to get out. Every other spot In the section was also illegally parked leaving me with no way out essentially stranded with my boat in the water and no way home. (My licence is also currently suspended but the ramp is a 5 min drive so I wasn’t worried about getting caught). 

I went to a level of rage I only experienced once at the end of my first manic episode after being prescribed antidepressants causing the start of my bipolar. I don’t know what possessed me but I keyed a line the full length of his car on both sides and carved dickhead into the door panel. I somehow got out after driving through a massive bush and almost ruining my car and trailer on the tall curb and went home still in that rage thinking it was funny and they deserved it.

Anyway, my manic episodes generally last a week and throughout this time I am consistently happy/energetic/motivated (sometimes irritable but not at all sad), then my depressive episodes last for weeks on end. 

But what about this in-between feeling? Like you're feeling sort of okay and you're functioning, but you get those waves of sadness that come and go? It's like I don't know what to do with myself. I guess that's how I'm feeling now. I don't feel manic or depressed, and I'm so used to feeling one or the other. It's almost easier. I think I was manic last week or the last few days, but today it's like I'm fighting to stay in a good mood and be productive but I have this niggling feeling of desperation like I'm starting to crash.

I upped my lamotrigine dose two weeks ago (150mg/day now) - I think it does work for me and I don't hit the super low catastrophic depressive episodes, but perhaps that's what is making me feel weird? Otherwise, maybe it's me becoming more self-aware of my mood cycles and I feel like I'm going to enter a depressive episode. But in that case, it's not a good thing because I'm paying too much attention to my moods? I don't know, it's driving me up the wall.

2795,13x3t5v,I think my job is trying to push me out. What do you think?,"Hey friends. I want to make sure I’m not having a severe emotional reaction by having fresh eyes view my situation. I tend to think people are rejecting me a lot, so I want to be sure I’m in the right…

I am recently employed with a full time job as of 3 months ago.

This was a big win for me and I’ve been so proud of myself.

I went in with bright eyes and ready to learn. I have made it a point to be social (within reason) with my new department. I’ve been kind. I’ve been eager to learn. 

So now we’ve hit 3 months. My training has been here and there. There’s no specific person in charge of training me. A lot of what I’m learning was either quickly explained in passing or even worse, I’ve self taught myself. 

Despite this, I’ve still kept a great attitude and have worked hard. Even more important, I think I’ve performed wonderfully despite the circumstances. My supervisor and I have discussed this at my weekly check in and she tells me the department is going through a big transformation and that they’ll get me fully trained “soon.” 

Then this past Friday at my check in she tells me two coworkers came to her about two mistakes I made. Well guess what? It was two things I wasn’t trained on. Who woulda thought!! She tells me it’s either sink or swim and “we’re a family” and she wants me to swim. The plan was to have me with a coworker this week pretty much sitting at her desk daily getting intensive training. 

Well this week has come and I’ve politely told this coworker that I’m ready to train and appreciate her time and to email when she’s ready and that i’d head over to her desk.
Guess what? She never got back to me either time. 

Then today, to top it off, a coworker decided to LOUDLY talk about me to another coworker saying Friday is going to suck because a few employees that work the same role as me will be out of town and she doesn’t believe I’m capable of holding down my end of the work and that she’s going to have to do it all for me and she was very upset. She vocalized this very kid it just around the corner from my desk. I have never once asked her or required her to do my work? It was a weird, rude, and passive aggressive comment. Plus she didn’t talk to me about it, she talked about ME to other people about it. I don’t behave like that. 

Lastly, the two coworkers that reported my tiny two mistakes I’ve made since starting are now giving me the cold shoulder. 

This isn’t fair. I wasn’t properly trained, have still performed exceptionally, and I’m being punished for THEIR lack of training. 

Anyway. I’m going to talk to my supervisor tomorrow. I’m upset and I don’t think I’m overreacting.

I can't really avoid all triggers. Some I can like my boyfriend yelling during road rage set me off once, but then there's saying something awkward in a social interaction that'll set me off and like I don't really have the socializing skills I need and it's worse for me to be alone so.

Question is: how do I change my brain's response to stress to something like ""oh I'm so sad that happened"" instead of suicidal Ideation or wanting to hurt myself?

I am going to therapy and I have been on psychiatric medication for about 8 years. Unfortunately because I have been on these meds for so long they no longer work as well as they use to and I've essentially been told that I need to find other ways to regulate. We tried changing the meds a lot and they help but they don't help as much as they use to. Sometimes they even make it worse. Currently on zoloft 25mg and seroquel 226mg.

5) Try to be productive; doesn’t work
6) Go back to my room, ruminate, and sulk; think depressed thoughts of varying degrees
7) Get a second wind later on, at night (sometimes after 3-4 beers or so)
8) Go to bed “happy” (at least not depressed)

I have been depressed, hypomanic, and manic before. This feels almost like I am getting a taste of hypomania and depression.

Vyvanse has been a lifesaver (started in January), but recently I’ve been running into this problem. My main issue is that it’s hard for me to be productive. It’s like my anxiety constantly sharpens its teeth to scourge me with increasingly biting remarks.

When I feel “depressed,” it’s easier to snap out of it than when I’ve ACTUALLY been depressed in the past. But, when I’ve ACTUALLY been hypomanic in the past, I have so much energy that I don’t even have time to think depressed thoughts. I feel like I’m bouncing back and forth.",5,0

Like you know

Drifting 

No border grasps my legs

Lightweight

Going my way

Grass goes green than grey

Never hesitate 

Never liked the herd anyways 

Burnt to entertain 

Naeseuw and contagious a smile 

Gravity breaks 

Coupling to lay the tracks 

Some shovel the stove 

Leaving the back burners ablaze

Celebrate 

Terrified by the fall

Or being caught up in the storm 

Remembering I’m my own tsunami 

A frigate amongst waves

Hydrogen the fuel 

Set to fissure 

Like fusion amongst the others

They nester when I’m at my worst 

People like a fraud 

A facade 

Looking well out

Interior a ticking time bomb

Delusion linger

Mind a pond

Where the malaria grows 

Nothing admirable of the view

I’m a fire never put out 

Until the steam run out 

I glow when I’m really burnt out 

Collision a guardrail gone bust

I’m dust

Unless a parachute gets caught up

I’m a stay at home mom and it seems like my only friends are my kids. I honestly think I’m a functioning alcoholic and it makes sense because it does run in my family. 


I don’t even know why I’m posting this I guess just to see if anyone else can relate. It would be nice to have friends to talk to because I already struggle with my bipolar and BPD. It seems like nobody can relate to what I’m going through like not even my husband understands it’s hard to relate to anybody honestly.


My husband doesn’t want me working because of stuff that has happened in the past when I was not medicated. Basically, I ran away for three months and did some not so smart things so he really doesn’t feel comfortable with me working which I mean I don’t blame him. I was a piece of shit before I was medicated.


Sometimes it just gets to me that this disease I have. I don’t mean to whine about it but it truly sucks. I look at my family members and I see them thriving and doing so good in life not saying that people with bipolar don’t do good in life, but in my situation I’ve been terrible.

Well this morning I had a big deal experience that made me wonder if I ever get triggered or if it's just internal body chemistry or synapses or something that cycles me up and down regardless of what's happening to me externally.

I am dying of end stage heart failure and today I was officially transferred from my regular cardiologist to a palliative care team. According to theories about death and dying, I should be depressed, grieving, something. But I'm in an up phase of my cycle (I'm effectively medicated, but I still know whether I'm slightly up or slightly down.), so I'm pretty serene. If anything, I'm happy.

So my theory is that the only thing that supposedly triggers an episode up or down is internal BP processes that come from the illness. The illness causes our episodes, nothing outside of us. So I don't need to worry about this sub triggering anything. What do you think?",31,0

I was diagnosed with depression, ocd, and social anxiety disorder at 15. Started taking seroquel and hallucinated all throughout high school, which mainly started after I was in a traumatic car accident where a kid died in front of me.

I got worse and was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at 19 after my boyfriend at the time assaulted me. I was put on one antipsychotic after another and developed psychosis so bad that i was hospitalized and put on latuda which caused tardive dyskinesia. Pill roulette ensued, and I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 21, told I couldnt have children (ever) because the meds would harm the fetus, and it would be impossible to stop them even for 9 months.

At this point, im 23, devastated, cannot keep a job, previously on the deans list ive now dropped out of college and go to vocational rehab for job training. 

There, my boss who was 11 years older wore me down and we start dating. Unbeknownst to me he was a heroin addict, so he becomes increasingly more abusive, assaulting and stealing from me regularly. He supports me so i feel i cannot leave and get pregnant at 25. I finally realize i need to protect our unborn child when he assaults me while pregnant and when i leave, he overdoses and dies. I have a miscarriage a couple days later

6 months later, I develop qt prolongation and have to get off my current antipsychotic. My psych says i dont have schizoaffective disorder. She apologized and says i have bipolar. I still dont get better years pass, still cant keep a job and meet a man who i date at 28 who pays for me to see a new psych finally.

New psych is appalled ive tried over 30 diff medications and says there is really nothing left to try. He says i show no signs of either schizoaffective or bipolar disorder and that the medication is clearly hurting not helping since i have so many side effects. He said to stop taking my mood stabilizer immediately and instead get intensive trauma informed therapy for emotional dysregulation. Thats my new diagnosis after 13 years of switching meds & never getting better. 

Im still taking cymbalta for depression and chronic pain, and im on the lowest dose of tegretol so he said i wont experience withdrawal (doubtful..)

2839,13wlo1b,"Recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, struggling to process all that’s happened now that I’m discharged","I (22F) was diagnosed with bp1 after a psychotic/mixed episode landed me in the mental ward. It was a really confusing and terrifying experience because no one in the ward would explain to me why I was there and I didn’t know what psychosis meant on my intake form. I guess I was put on a hold? Or committed by the psychiatrist at the ER? The details are still really murky to me because this was the first time I had ever been full blown manic and I was like that for the week I was committed. Only when I was coming down did I realize that half of the people I thought I saw were visual hallucinations. To think I could be so detached from reality was traumatizing. I never experienced mania or psychosis before the hospitalization and only got a bipolar diagnosis when I was discharged and went to a psychiatrist unaffiliated with that hospital.

My whole life I thought I was just clinically depressed like most of my peers (I was diagnosed at 18 but didn’t pursue medication for my depression due to unsupportive parents). My life was going relatively well before my first manic episode; I was making new friends, living alone in a dream city, interviewing for a dream job, seeing a guy I really liked. Then my manic self just bulldozed everything. While most of my friendships and other practical parts of my life remain intact, the thing I regret most is how I spammed and totally creeped out the guy I was seeing with deranged texts and photos because I was convinced that God had chosen us to be the next Virgin Mary and Joseph (I still cringe over this). I’ve already apologized to him but I recognize that I cannot salvage things. It’s really hard to move on because I was having such a great time getting to know him. I understand I need to focus on myself right now by taking my medication, cultivating healthy habits, sleeping well. I just can’t help but mourn all the things that could have been, especially because those actions weren’t in my control. It’s hard to accept that everything is somehow different now, even if that hospitalization and everything leading up to it felt like a horrible dream.

HELP! He’s saying all the right words like our anniversary (I’ve been his patient since 2019), and everything nice. The feeling has subsided a little bit. IS IT NORMAL TO FEEL IN LOVE WITH YOUR PSYCHIATRIST? How long am I going stay in love? A little help is greatly appreciated guys.",2,0

Amongst many other odd symptoms of course. Then I mentioned it to my psychiatrist and she said what I’ve been experiencing is classic BD symptoms. I start my first dose of Lithium today, I’d love to hear everyone’s experience with Lithium. Seems to be a medication many people with BD have success with.

2847,13wftn7,I finally feel happy,"I’ve been describing the past week as “the third worst week of my life.” I started feeling low and put myself into a really unsafe situation more than once.

Yet when I went to therapy today, I started telling my therapist about how I actually feel good. Sure it’s been a rough last few days, but I still feel happy. I am capable of feeling happy.

For a long time, I couldn’t feel happy. I always felt low or numb. I never got the euphoria that some get with mania. Just feeling out of control and panicking. I thought I would never feel better. That I was doomed to always feel bad.

Two years ago I finally started getting on the right meds. I’m now on a good combo that works for me. I’m sitting in bed right now after baking bread and watching a movie with my sister just smiling. I don’t feel crushed by the weight of how awful this past week has been. That’s a really big step for me, and as someone who never thought I’d see the other side of being unstable for so long, I thought I’d share to hopefully encourage someone else.",7,0
2848,13wfd9k,Medical discrimination,"Okay maybe I’m being dramatic but I’m really upset rn. I have a new psychiatrist and it feels like she thinks I’m lying about shit when I’m literally not. She doesn’t even think I have bipolar disorder but I’ve been diagnosed bipolar by 3 separate psychiatrists!!! She said I have cyclothymia instead. So now I’m questioning everything. Also I have debilitating adhd and the main reason I was going to her is bc I need adderall re-prescribed. She said I need to start a mood stabilizer to be on stimulants which I understand and agreed to. She wouldn’t prescribe the adderall until I’ve been on that for a month. So after a month I’m thinking she will prescribe the adderall and she’s like “well I need to see all of ur documentation from ur past psychiatrist and a full panel of labs and a urine drug screen”. So I sign a release of information form and get all the blood work and drug screen. But idk I feel like it’s kinda weird that she is refusing to prescribe me a medication that I literally need + helps me a lot until she sees these documents. I honestly don’t know why she needs to see them lmao, I think it’s bc she doesn’t believe I’m bipolar but whatever. Also my past psychiatrists never asked for a drug screen for adderall before. And ofc my labs and drug screen came back normal and negative for everything so I sent them to her last week and made sure she received them but she still hasn’t wrote the prescription for adderall like she said. I’m just frustrated it’s been a long 2 months trying to accomplish things without adderall and I’m debating just finding another psych because she is being so weird.",3,0
2849,13wfezx,Safety of taking Vyvanse while being bipolar? Is anyone else here on this med?,"My NP prescribed me vyvanse for neurodivergence related problems, but I  have worries about it. I haven't had hypo-/manic symptoms in several  months, and we tried atomoxetine earlier this year and there was still  no hypomanic with it either (which I stopped because it made me too  sick). But after the first dose of vyvanse, this feels a little more  ""oomph"" than I've been used to and I worry about it. My biggest question  is, if I have no induced hypomanic problems early on does it mean it  shouldn't do that later on? Or am I at risk forever? Any other things I  should know?

2854,13we7kg,i hate mania more than i hate depression,"my friends don’t understand this at all, and i don’t have any other friends who are bipolar to talk to this about, so excuse the rant. 

i hate how this makes me feel. i’ve done so many stupid things while i was manic and it always leads me to having panic attacks about the consequences of those actions. i have to take sleep medication to just knock me out because they get so bad and nothing we have tried has helped. im scared of myself sometimes. i hate when people say that mania is fun, because mine is terrifying. it’s so terrifying and i just want it to stop. 

i had friends in the past that have used my manic episodes to get me to do dumb/illegal things and i have introduced some of those tendencies to my new friend group while manic. i feel guilty every day for some of the things i’ve done while in that state. (i’m not referring to hurting people or having a traumatic impact on peoples lives) i don’t know how to make the guilt and fear stop.

i was diagnosed pretty young and started taking medication for anxiety, depression, and bipolar in middle school. i have bipolar 2 and because of medication and therapy, i have been able to manage for the most part. i have recently started a new job, finished my first year of college with a 4.0 GPA and i’m going outside and hanging with my friends more often. these are supposed to be good things right?


i don’t know why the swings are back. i’m trying so hard to hide it as i really don’t want to worry my parents (especially my mom as if i look even a little bit upset she freaks out). i’m doing everything i’m supposed to do. i have more bursts of mania and more depressive episodes than i’ve had in a long time. i don’t know if it’s the stress from school and my new job or if something just isnt working. i’m afraid that it’s going to ruin everything again like my relationships, school, or my job.


anyways, i just wanted to get some feelings out and get some insight from others who may be going through the same thing.

2856,13wcylw,My parents took away my car two days ago and now I'm losing my mind,"My parents just took away my car, I'm 22 so I feel like I'm being treated like a teenager. I left the house for a semester to stay at college and get away from them. I just moved back about 2 weeks ago and they're already doing this to me. I'm not trying to play victim, so I'm sorry if it sounds this way. This is just very important to me because I have no money currently since I was overwhelmed at school when I got a job. They wanted me to do 40 hours of online training. That mixed with school, I ended up doing neither because it overwhelmed me too much and because of that I only did one shift at the job because they wanted me to complete the training sooner and I only started it the day before my shift. After that unraveled I started looking for a new job but only just now found one. I start mid june so I most likely will have money 3-4 weeks after I start it. My parents won't allow me to use the car for anything other than work and since I won't have money I'm either trapped at home or anywhere I can bike or walk to since I have no money for train or anything. Unless my friends pick me up to do something which I won't have any money for. There is only one bar near me my friends go to and that's the only thing within my distance. The reason they took away the car was because I ran a red light, I was following a big truck I guess slightly too close so I didn't see the red in time to stop. I've learned to space myself better. They are doing this because they are mad I have been doing doordash in between looking for jobs. I've only been doing it for pocket money for gas and to see my friends, go to a small $15 show. Things like that. 

I feel very trapped and I already tried hurting myself and I cut holes into my wall. It is so hard for me to overreact. I know this seems like something so small, but seeing my friends and going to a show, these are the only things that make me happy and keep me alive. I am constantly suicidal and struggling, but my family does not see that at all. They say that I am faking along with other things. And before you ask if I'm diagnosed, I am. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and a multitude of other mental illnesses that I'm pretty sure were just wrong diagnoses and I only have the bipolar. But yes, I am on medication, I'm diagnosed, but this medication does not help with everything. Any drastic changes in my life can overpower the medication helping me. 

I want to move out, but I feel trapped. I don't know how to move out, I feel like I lack all life knowledge. My dad even refuses to teach me how to change my tire. I told them I will pay the insurance once my new job starts paying me. I struggle in every job, it is so hard for me to keep a job because of my illness and instead of support they just constantly put me down, even my sister who is 19. I feel like this is all my fault and I should've just forced myself somehow to do the online training for the other job and maybe I could've had some money saved by now, but I constantly ruin everything. I feel I never have any real support and I feel alone and hopeless in what to do. I can't even take more classes. I dropped my classes down to 2 and I couldn't even do those, I had to withdraw towards the end of the semester since I didn't want F's. I haven't told my parents this and don't plan to, if anything I would be paying it back, I have full financial aid so all of my school has been covered. 

I just wish I had done everything and figured out how to leave by now, but every small problem that happens in my life crushes me so badly I want to take my life or hurt myself and then nothing matters to me and I feel like I can't accomplish anything. I know that once I move out I'll be able to finish school over time and feel better, but at this moment it is so hard for me in this house. My dad is a very mean person, my parents are both polish immigrants so they think I have it easy. I have so much trauma because I was always labeled a bad child and meanwhile I had bipolar the whole time and instead of therapy and help and understanding I just would get yelled at and hit. They have such a bad image of me and my dad says horrible things to me everyday. Any single thing he can think of to hurt me, make me feel like a loser, anything to get his internal anger out. Then they both want me to praise them. Paying for my car insurance and letting me live in the house to finish college doesn't equal emotional abuse being okay. He constantly gaslights me, manipulates me, and accuses me. Today he accused me of stealing hundreds of dollars from him which I didn't do and wouldn't ever. 

I can't express any emotion ever or they threaten to call the police or take things away from me. I already feel like I have so little to live for and I feel embarrassed that something as stupid as not being able to use my car and having no money for 2 months is hurting my mental health this badly. I'm still trying to get over losing two friends over them thinking I was flirting with their boyfriend which I btw didn't do and wouldn't do to my friends. I entrusted my parents with this information still during the semester and since I've been home my dad has used it as another thing to hurt me. He says I can't keep any friends and that I have new friends every month which isn't even true. He expects me to have the same friends from high school just because my sister does but my friends from high school did horrible things to me and for that reason they are not my friends anymore. I am just over being hurt so much when I'm already struggling so much.

And now because all of this I have so many bad thoughts on my mind because of the depression creeping in. I'm starting to feel like my friends don't like me and they don't want to talk to me and now I want to ignore them and not talk to anyone. I feel like I'm only a crybaby and just bother them, I try not to say anything about how I'm feeling but I think sometimes I need to for them to know why I'm acting a certain way etc.

I'm sorry this is so long. I just really need help. I don't know how I'm going to make this plan and don't know where to start, I'm just a broke college student. I have 2 1/2 years of schooling finished only and in my major I have to get a masters in order to make decent money. The only amount of money I really want is to have somewhere to live and enough money to go out with my friends. I'm trying to become a social worker, but with how horrible my mental health keeps getting I have no idea how I will finish all that schooling. 

Can anyone help and tell me any advice? How do I get through this period of time staying somewhat okay? I am going to call therapists tomorrow, but my last therapist only ever made me angry after every session so I have no idea if only having a therapist will do much. I'm just very scared of hurting myself badly and I don't want it to be over something like this, something so dumb.",3,0

3013,q0l360,"A lot of bipolar people are stable, you just don’t hear from us.","I’ve been trying to get stable for six years and finally found Seroquel in 2019. It completely changed my life. 

I don’t really visit this subreddit that much because I really have no questions to ask. I’m doing really well so my mind is on other things and any bipolar-related issues I have, I have plenty of experience now and know pretty well what to do. So you don’t hear from me at all.

I just wanted to say that it’s important to realize that many people are like me. Scrolling through posts, it may seem like a horrific prognosis and endless problems, but in reality, *only those who need support post here*. The people who are stable don’t typically regularly browse Internet forums so there is really zero representation of people like me.

I have a few different diagnoses and it can seem like life is hell, based on the Internet forums. The majority of subreddit forum members are seeking support because they are having a difficult time. Those that are stable and well managed don’t post because they are off living their life and don’t need advice.

Does anyone want to share their success story?",1407,0

The worst part is never truly knowing who you are. I look back at myself (text messages, Facebook messages, memories if I have any) when I was in an episode (depressive or manic) and I literally don't recognise that person. I find myself saying ""Am I really like that? Who is that person?""

Combine that with the dissociation (not being in my own body for the majority of the time) and I don't feel like I know myself or ever will. Does anyone else get this or is it just me?",1005,0

3440,3tzvqo,Things I wish I'd known about bipolar,"I wrote this up to process my experiences this year with the thought of maybe sharing it online. I already bugged everyone on facebook about what I was going through when I was going through it though, so maybe not. I thought I'd post it here anyway. Maybe it's helpful to some people.

**Mania feels like enlightenment**

Mania brought out huge emotions that I never knew were in me. I felt deep feelings of love some days, anger others and an all-over general disregard for consequences. It doesn’t matter what I did, I felt validated.

The thoughts I had were all-important. I had a right to whatever good thing life threw at me and I was convinced I could get along with everyone and if I couldn’t, well it was their fault.

Having such a big shift in your thought feels spiritually important when you’re in it. I’m not the only person who's suddenly found their spiritual side out of nowhere.

You see madness coming as you approach it and then suddenly, *wham*, you’re Neo and you have to save the world. This is different, you’re not mad, you have purpose. Life isn’t a confusing march to death after all!

**Depression taught me there isn’t a *real* me**

I thought I was someone who enjoyed exercise, but one day my body felt heavy and I couldn’t go to the gym any more. I thought I was someone who was intelligent, but one day my brain was like treacle and I couldn’t do my job. I thought I was someone with a sense of humour, but one day I couldn’t even come up with words. I thought I was someone with friends and family who I loved, but then I trusted no-one.

You get back to this blank state of nihilistic solipsism and have to rebuild one block at a time.

**Normality is the bit that feels unstable**

I’m fairly convinced most people go through life feeling a little bit fragile and unsure of themselves. They know an unkind word could send them into a pit or a kind word in the right place could make them feel on top of the world.

A mood disorder is the negation of all of that. You feel one way. Manic, it doesn’t matter what someone says to you, you are on a mission. Of course they’re telling you you’re crazy, you’re doing something no-one has done before. People thought every great person was crazy. But soon you’ll prove them all wrong.

People humour me when I’m depressed. Or if they’re not humouring me it’s only because they don’t know my deep, terrible secrets. And they’re all terrible too. I'll remember every little thing they ever said or did to me. They feel obligated to me as a friend, of course, but I know they’d rather be with anyone else.

**Mood swings make me dumb**

I like to think I’m reasonably intelligent, but trying to do my job whilst going through a depressive episode was hopeless. I had a system where I’d have evernote open and write timestamped notes as I was working. I’d lose focus every minute and have to look at the list of things I’d been doing. Even then my brain was like treacle.

And amnesia is a huge side-effect too. At the deepest depression, your entire mental vision is filled with your regrets. You can’t remember the joy you felt on your childhood holidays or even what you were doing that morning.

Strangely, you can remember everything negative. Not just about you either, about everybody.

I hope I never take my life, but knowing I get to a place where I'm retarded; can’t remember anything positive; where my body feels heavy and I feel generally like a worthless, unattached piece of shit with no sense of identity scares me. It’s not a game. I know what I value about my life now, but when I’m in that pit, those memories aren’t available to me any more.

**You have to learn trust**

Losing touch with reality and having a brain that didn’t work meant I had to trust other people to think for me. Whether it was nurses, doctors, family or friends. I have been severely retarded for months this year and I am infinitely grateful to everyone who put up with that.

You can’t judge how mad you are yourself. Your brain’s entire internal logic changes. All the time you’ll feel like whatever you’re doing is the most natural thing in the world. I have done bizarre stuff, but it all seemed normal, at the time.

There’s a point when you have to toss your life’s keys to someone else if you want to be safe.

**Apologies are complex**

Do you apologise for what you said manic?

Do you apologise for being bad at your job depressed?

Do you apologise for making inappropriate advances, losing your cool, getting in fights?

Do you apologise for not answering calls, not tidying up after yourself, being surly?

Do you apologise knowing that if people can’t put up with you being unreliable sometimes, you’re going to have to apologise again and again?

It’s fair to say I regret a huge portion of my life. There are people I’m probably never going to talk to again. And all through the episodes, it’s still me, but what do I do with that? I know what I did, I know why I upset people. And I know I’ll probably do similarly stupid things again.

**Mental illness is fundamentally lonely**

At a certain point in mania, I got frustrated that no-one thought I was telepathic like I knew I was and depression told me that no-one out there cared or understood. In deepest depression I can’t even vocalise what I’m feeling, so what use is a hotline?

It was actually helpful to be sectioned whilst manic. Being around other people who were uncertain about the nature of reality was somewhat comforting.",917,0

A couple days ago I learned that my grandma is getting pretty sick and that there isn't a whole lot that anyone can do. Obviously we can't visit because of COVID. So it's a sad time. (She's had a long and good life. I've been lucky to have her in my life. It's natural and everyone eventually dies, but it's still sad, you know?)


Anyway, at the risk of sounding like I have a heart of stone, the sadness I feel about the situation with my grandma is a lot easier to deal with than depressive episodes. It's an emotional reaction to an event. I'm sad, but I'm still myself. 


Depressive episodes are *nothing* like this sadness. During those episodes it feels like black tar is oozing through my veins instead of blood. I've never felt happiness before and I never will. Everything is dark and there isn't an escape. 


Then when the pendulum swings the other way it feels like my body is on vibrate, but *just* fast enough to be at a high-pitched hum. It's like I'm watching the part of my favorite movie that comes *right before* the climax but the climax never comes. I *want* to do everything but if I sit down to do anything I'll explode.


Normal happiness? Nothing like that.


It seems like happiness and sadness are *reactions*. They're the effect, not the cause. Depression and mania are the opposite for me. They occur by themselves and affect other parts of my life. I'm not feeling happy because I'm listening to a good song, I'm playing the first 10 seconds of 15 different songs because I'm looking for a way to externalize the intense energy I'm feeling. 


Happiness and sadness change the way I feel, but depression and mania change the way I see.",772,0

My mood stabilizers made it really hard for me to adjust the stimulant dosage and I developed a pill taking phobia but I am finally stable.

1,142vtbk,"Discord / Group Chat invites, the first Megathread!","Hello!

There have been a growing number of Discord and various social software invites posted of late.

We'd like to cut down on the noise, and facilitate making it easy for people to both advertise and discover the plethora of social media groups and Discord servers you all run.

There are some proposed ground rules for this new initiative:

* Invites must only be posted to the monthly Megathread. A new thread will be posted on the 1st of the month at 6pm London time.
* Please post a direct invite link for your server / group, and avoid practices such as asking people to message you in private.
* Because private groups do sometimes result in drama, or unhealthy environments, you must be open to an r/schizophrenia moderator freely wandering in to check it out, if we receive any complaints or safety concerns are raised. 

&#x200B;

As this is the first month, and we're a week in. I'm posting this as the first Megathread to roll the ball.

Another similar post was denied publication because the moderators thought it could encourage delusions. The Christian members of my entourage call it a sin to communicate with spirits. My psychiatrist suggested that, like for color-blindness, my brain might be impairing my perception. I adress this question to anyone out there, especially sceptical professionals who can and will demonstrate it: Is my belief a false one? Are the ""voices"" not ghosts, and if they aren't, please explain. John Nash realized that the little girl was a hallucination because she never grew old. Could she in fact be a ghost?",9,1

23,149rtt0,Confused by online test results....,"Someone posted here over the past week that they took an online schizophrenia test that showed a high probability of schizophrenia. They were already diagnosed with schizophrenia and found it amusing.

I have been diagnosed as a schizophrenic for almost twenty years. Tried therapy, meds, etc. I do experience some audio hallucinations, but they didn't start until some traumatic experiences that took place several years AFTER being diagnosed. I do not find them particularly distressing. I was initially diagnosed over some beliefs about things that were happening in my life that even I was able to admit were improbable, but they were clearly not impossible.

I just took multiple, free online tests for assessing schizophrenia. All but one indicated low and/or NO probability of schizophrenia. The one that indicated a problem, only acknowledged that I have had significant distress over some things. It didn't give a strong indication of psychosis itself.

I mean, I never made shit up while talking with therapists. I even had a disability review over the past few years where they considered me disabled. At the review, I was uncharacteristically blunt and open and honestly expected NOT to be considered disabled any longer. But I got my disability payments renewed.

26,14978u7,It's like my brain is changed after my last psychosis... I used to blame the medication but after reducing it to dangerously small amounts I realized it's me.,"Hi guys,

I hope you are doing well and not letting this disease get the best of you (so many amazing, kind, smart, and brave people on here, you inspire me!). Lately, I am starting to realize that the avolition and anhedonia I feel is not from my medication (I take about 2 mg of olanzapine daily) but is rather the negative symptoms I experience after my last Really bad psychosis. I think it gave me some sort of brain damage because it was so wild and crazy what i went through. The reason for my conclusion comes from the fact that these couple of days I took less olanzapine and I didn't feel any better, in fact, i even felt more depressed. I was wondering if my brain will ever feel better. I used to be a happy individual with so many interests. Most importantly I was very active and i found so much joy in moving, now moving is simply painful. Do our brains have the capacity to heal and get better? 

Also, I keep thinking what happened to me last year, how could my psychosis been so so bad but now I am Ok on such a small amount of medication? Before my psychosis I smoked an obscene amount of pot, like chain smoking day and night, sometimes the pot would not even be from a good source or from god knows where.. Is it possible that what happened to me was drug-induced psychosis and maybe even if i have schizophrenia if i stay away from drugs and stress maybe it could be managed on relatively small doses of APs? 

I hope all of you are doing well. Also, wanted to update that i finally tried Vraylar but it made me bed bound, i was not willing to sit with the side effects for a while to see if maybe the drug could work for me, I decided to stop taking it and talk to my doctor see what could be done about it.

32,1494mg2,Dopamine Enhancing routine/diet to combat energy draining effects of anti-psychotic medication,"Although easier said than done, these tips can enhance dopamine levels and keep energy levels up until you are able to adjust to your medications dopamine reducing effects. Most medication cause low energy levels, fatigue, inability to focus and stay alert. These key points if put into motion can counter these side effects.

If you have any tips or routines that help you keep your energy/motivation levels up, please do share them in this thread.  


**Suggested Routine to naturally boost dopamine levels**

**Morning:**

* 	Start the day with 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such 	as a brisk walk or a workout routine. This can help increase 	dopamine levels and promote overall well-being.
* Consume a 	balanced breakfast that includes foods rich in tyrosine, such as 	eggs, lean meats, or legumes. Include fruits or vegetables for added 	antioxidants.  
 

**Daytime:**

* 	Throughout the day, practice stress management techniques whenever 	needed. Take short breaks to engage in deep breathing exercises, 	meditation, or mindfulness to reduce stress levels and support 	dopamine balance.
* Stay 	hydrated and consider replacing caffeinated beverages with herbal 	tea or water.  
 

**Afternoon:**

* Take a 	break for creative activities or hobbies that bring you joy. This 	can include listening to music, painting, writing, or engaging in 	any other creative pursuits that stimulate dopamine release.

&#x200B;

**Evening:**

* Allocate 	time for socializing with friends or loved ones. Plan activities 	like going for a walk together, having a meal, or engaging in 	meaningful conversations that promote positive social interactions 	and support dopamine levels.  
 

**Night:**

* Before 	bedtime, create a calm and conducive environment for quality sleep. 	Establish a regular sleep schedule and aim for 7-9 hours of 	uninterrupted sleep. Avoid the use of caffeine or ephedrine in the 	evening, as they may interfere with sleep quality and dopamine 	regulation.  
 

**Dopamine Enhancing Dietary Overview**

&#x200B;

1. **Proteins:** 	Foods rich in proteins provide the necessary building blocks for 	dopamine synthesis. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, 	legumes, and dairy products in your diet.  
 
2. **Tyrosine-rich foods:** Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in dopamine synthesis. 	Foods such as almonds, avocados, bananas, eggs, chicken, and turkey 	are good sources of tyrosine.  
 
3. **Leafy greens:** Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens 	contain high levels of folate. Folate is important for 	neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine.  
 
4. **Fruits and vegetables:** Berries, particularly blueberries, are rich in 	antioxidants and may have neuroprotective effects, promoting brain 	health. Other fruits and vegetables, such as oranges, tomatoes, and 	bell peppers, provide essential vitamins and minerals that support 	dopamine function.  
 
5. **Nuts and seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds are rich 	in nutrients like magnesium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, which 	are beneficial for brain health and neurotransmitter function.  
 
6. **Dark chocolate:** Dark chocolate contains compounds like flavonoids and 	phenylethylamine (PEA), which may help enhance mood and support 	dopamine release. Choose dark chocolate with a high cocoa content 	(70% or higher) and consume in moderation.  
 
7. **Green tea:** Green tea contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which 	has been shown to have a positive impact on dopamine levels and 	brain function. It can promote relaxation while enhancing alertness.  
 
8. **Turmeric:** 	Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound known for its 	anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help protect 	dopamine-producing neurons and support overall brain health.  
 
9. **Probiotic-rich foods:** Emerging research suggests a link between gut health and 	dopamine production. Including fermented foods like yogurt, 	sauerkraut, kimchi, and kefir in your diet can support a healthy gut 	microbiome, which may indirectly influence dopamine levels.  
 
10. **Water:** 	Staying hydrated is essential for optimal brain function, including 	neurotransmitter synthesis and release. Make sure to drink an 	adequate amount of water throughout the day.  
 

**Other Considerations: Enhance and Maintain dopamine levels**

&#x200B;

1. **Regular exercise:** 	Engaging in aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote overall brain health. Aim for 	at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the 	week.  
 
2. **Get enough sleep:** Quality sleep is essential for proper 	neurotransmitter function, including dopamine regulation. Aim for 	7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to support optimal brain 	health.  
 
3. **Manage stress:** Chronic stress can negatively impact dopamine levels. 	Explore stress-reducing techniques such as meditation, deep 	breathing exercises, yoga, or engaging in hobbies and activities you 	enjoy.  
 
4. **Listen to music:** Listening to music you love can induce pleasure and 	increase dopamine release. Choose music that uplifts your mood and 	makes you feel good.  
 
5. **Set and 	achieve goals:** Accomplishing goals, both big and small, can 	activate the brain's reward pathways and boost dopamine levels. 	Break larger goals into smaller, achievable tasks to experience a 	sense of accomplishment along the way.  
 
6. **Practice	mindfulness:** Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or 	mindful breathing, can help improve dopamine receptor sensitivity 	and enhance overall well-being.  
 
7. **Spend time in nature:** Being in nature has been shown to have a 	positive impact on mood and overall brain health. Take walks in 	green spaces, go hiking, or simply spend time outdoors to 	potentially increase dopamine levels.  
 
8. **Socialize and connect:** Engaging in meaningful social interactions, 	spending time with loved ones, and nurturing relationships can 	stimulate dopamine release and promote feelings of happiness and 	well-being.  
 
9. **Seek  pleasurable experiences:** Engage in activities that bring you joy 	and pleasure, whether it's playing a musical instrument, dancing, 	painting, or engaging in hobbies you are passionate about. Enjoying 	pleasurable experiences can enhance dopamine release.  
 
10. **Limit excessive dopamine-depleting behaviors:** Certain behaviors like 	excessive consumption of alcohol, drug use, and excessive gambling 	can deplete dopamine levels over time. Moderation and balance are 	key.",10,1

41,1499132,How do you discern paranoid schizophrenia from narcissism.,"My dad couldn’t handle more than 10 minutes shopping in a public place. He use to say that every person he passed by was either judging him or conveying some kind of “meaning” with just a passing glance.

Even something as simple as driving, he always thought the people he was passing by we’re looking at him, thinking something about him.

It was impossible for him to understand that “@everyone” didn’t actually apply to him in some way. Everything, was somehow, meant for him. He would actually give very sound and logical reasons for it as well. Sometimes it was hard for even me to argue with the logic he could come up with.

He was incredibly smart, but not a “proud” man. So, I have trouble believing he was a “narcissist”. I’m not aware that he was officially diagnosed “narcissistic” either. He was diagnosed with “paranoid schizophrenia”.",3,1

It has to be said that I was under a lot of work stress (worked 50+ hours a week) and also had a lot of private stress (moving, credit, major financial expenses etc.).   


During my psychosis I went to the psychiatric ward and stayed there for a month. With Tavor and risperidone, I regained consciousness quickly and was no longer psychotic after a few days. The therapies and medication did me a lot of good and I quickly felt normal again. Nobody got out of the clinic as quickly as I did.   


Now I take 3 mg risperidone daily and notice that it has negative side effects (e.g. depression, listlessness, etc.).  The doctor said that it is not yet known to what extent I ""only"" had a drug-induced psychosis or whether it was schizophrenia after all. As soon as I had a psychosis a second time, it's schizophrenia. I have to say that I am very afraid of the future and I don't know how to deal with it. I haven't been psychotic since the psychosis, but I had to quit my job because I couldn't cope with the stress. What do you think? Did I ""just"" have a drug-induced psychosis or do I have schizophrenia?

48,149f1fe,Convenient schizophrenia and fake destigmatization," I am annoyed by attempts to bring schizophrenia into the clinical space of minor psychiatry for the sake of moderating public opinion. I swear, soon the whole thing will be passed on to social workers and psychotherapists. The tendency towards the ""neutering"" of schizophrenia results in underestimation of its severity, blurring of diagnostic criteria, frivolous statements lsuch as “they just need love,"" ""they are at their lowest"" and other examples of so called tolerance, in which there is no understanding of this complex phenomenon, rooted in the very essence of human nature. And from here there is the image of a convenient, ""adequate"" schizo: a little ragged and despirited, yet functional for the most part. And these are the type of patients we protect legally. We're talking about people who had a couple of flare-ups, who blog, give interviews, complain and demonstrate other wonders of critical thinking. Psychotics so light and formal they were allowed to step within the boundaries of normativity, while the  true madness was left in the taboo area. 

 Don't get me wrong, it's great that we see the chance of rehabilitation for hose suffering from severe mental illness, but ... what about the chronic ones: filthy lost vagrants, institutionalized patients who never leave their beds? How long will it take us to start looking for an approach to these people?
Answer: a lot.
Bcause such an images will never fit into standart, they are unintelligible to us and therefore we fail to empathize with said cases. We KNOW they are hopeless, hopelessly different from us. And this the reason why we give our sympathy to those who parade their diagnosis in search of attention and pity. Our understanding of schizophrenia has been shaped by stories of self-harm and demonic possession from the lips of those who have gone through ""hell"" (well-dressed, combed folk not shying away from smiling!). But there are those who will not tell you anything. And only they know the truth.

49,148w84c,Weird results with meditation,"So, i meditated for a year and i didn't know i was schizophrenic, so i probably went too hardcore in it since i discovered that schizophrenia can make the meditating experience into a very intense one. I had the most vivid hallucinations, but one day i figured out how to do yoga nidra. It is like the most relaxed state you can be while still awake, the only thing you can do is choosing to wake up. So, something very unique happened: the voices stopped. I use to have voices calling my name in a censoring manner or an internal voice who judged me all the time and was very cruel and it just stopped after. I feel like this sort of relaxation cleaned the cookies in my brain and corrected this part somehow. Anywhoo. This was one of the experiences. Have any of you tried meditation?  


(and i'm not recommending meditation to anyone, please see your doctor, this is just a rant)",16,1

52,148r1yk,Does anyone else suffer from REALLY bad memory loss/fog?,"It sucks. I've been dealing with this since last year, and I don't know what to do about it.  


I know part of it is that I was ""drinking"" for a while in order to get rid of the visions and hallucinations. I recently quit a few days ago because I was doing it to the point where I passed out. My meds have not fully taken away the hallucinations, and drinking was the only way to get rid of it.  


But even prior to that, I was getting violent headaches. I went through several med switches that gave me the dreaded ""brain fog"", where I feel like my total recall is shot, sometimes I can't keep up etc. Light can hurt, but only certain types of light (I'm fine with the outside sun, but certain bubbles are just blinding). My visions have bad this year too. And they are increasing. I'll have them at night sometimes, and they are extremely powerful and give me a searing headache.  


Day to day life is fairly blurry- which is hard to explain. Part of it I know is the dissociation. What sucks about all this is that I'm working a job that requires me to be ""on"". I have to be able to memorize a lot of information, know different clients, do a lot of paperwork and data running, and I'm constantly having information thrown at me. I feel like I'm actually good at my job? And I'm getting better every day, but I hate the ""lazy"" or ""little"" mistakes I make. I feel like I can't win. I can do 9 things right, then forget the 10th because I honestly don't recall it. And I know it's frustrating to everyone. Which just makes my paranoia worse, like I feel like everyone hates me, and that results in guilt and shame etc.   


It just sucks. I'm tired of headaches, of not remembering... I love my job but it makes me not want to go to work, which is a problem because I have to work. I wish I could just... stay home? Be a little housewife, bake cookies, have babies, lead a life of very little stress. I just can't with this memory fog.  


My psychiatrist told me it was normal, which meds to take at night etc. I've tried adjusting them but nothing helps.  


I would like to succeed at life, to remember things etc. I don't know what to do. Just wondering if anyone else is going through it.",12,1

I live in a different state, have been dealing with my own 'stuff', and haven't been the best at checking in with him. I admit. I'm also a beginner when it comes to my understanding of this condition. I've read so many accounts of people who have managed the disease and went on to be fully functional individuals with a fulfilled life. This leads me to believe we've failed him in getting the right doctor who can help him with the right medications that work for him. 

I'm desperately seeking solutions for my poor brother. Sadly, he has always been the kindest, sweetest soul and a better person than any of us siblings. He was dealt a bad hand. How can I help him before it's too late?? 

I do worry that he won't want to be here anymore. He's expressed that he's 'gotta go and pls dont be sad'' once during an episode a couple years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if that thought persists. His life is not one to be envied.

I cant really recall what triggers the werewolf and other shapeshifting creatures one.

66,1491nhx,Am I hearing voices or could it be an auditory processing problem?,"When I was going through my psychosis one form my voices would take is that I would hear real people say things about me when I walked by them. These people might be with each other or by themselves but I would always hear comments related to me or what I was doing. I've never been sure if this is part of my hallucinations because I also have autism which can cause auditory processing issues/ differences.

For example the majority of my voices were disembodied. There was no real life person attached to them. Other voices were within other sounds like running water or traffic but these would repeat the same things as the disembodied voices. It is only the category of voices that come from real people that confuse me. 

In the last week alone I have witnessed several people comment on me when I walk by them and these are complete strangers. I've heard people nudge their friend and say oh look to the right in the direction that I'm walking. I heard someone who lives opposite me say when I walked by that I'm always looking out the window and I'm probably a rat which means a snitch. When I was walking my dog there were some trucks and building vehicles so I decided to take a detour around them but then I heard the builders make comments when I did that at first and then when I came back from my walk later and walked by them again I heard them say things like well he's just a kid and there's his dog or something along those lines. I feel like in general people seem to bother or harass me. But I also think that I simply stand out and for some reason people stare or notice and then decide to make comments either directly to me or to the person they're with about me.

This is something that has been going on for such a long time. I've only noticed it happening more this week but I know that it used to happen when I was a teenager too. I understand that it seems unlikely for this to be happening so frequently but that's why I want to know is it possible that hearing people comment on me when I walk by is an auditory processing issue due to the fact that I'm autistic and I'm mistaking the words they are actually saying or is it a consistent hallucination that I've been having for about 15 years or more?

Lately I just feel like people have been going out of their way to he nasty to me when I don't bother a soul and I'm always out on my own. I'm not on medication for 2 years & I've been doing mentally great. So it concerns me that recently this is happening more. I have been under a great deal of stress these past few months.

Although I previously received a schizophrenia dx  I'm not convinced I have it but I definitely have had psychosis.

68,148qkb8,"How has the most recent revelations about UFOs, and aliens (or Non-Human Intelligence) impacted your thoughts about your psychosis if it involved delusions or hallucinations that were of this nature?","In 2021 I was diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar based off the implications that I was telling the doctors I was psychic hallucinating, and delusional talking to, seeing spirits or angels. Plus I thought that with my auditory hallucinations that I was a US forigen ambassador or half blood prince to the 9 star constellation of pleiades. Basing my actions off these conversations with spirits, and which in my past got me arrested. 

For example my first psychosis. I was 17 in High School after my two friends died the year before, and I heard a voice in church plus had a hallucination at one of my friends funeral. It was a voice that told me it was God, and talked to me a lot since his funeral in my brain comforting me. 

I was in class when I heard a loud thunderous voice coming from above talking about how a telephone in front of me was going to ring in 10 seconds. I counted down, and it rang. So I got up, and followed this voices every command thinking it was God. Making me believe I was the second coming of Christ, and I was trying to figure out time travel to save my life from my psychosis I was in. Getting me arrested. 

I've heard now that there are malevolent aliens, and I was thinking about how maybe this is what happened. I was crying, praying out to the world inside my head and I heard a voice. This voice I trusted as God but it ended up decieving me, and told me great truths plus showed me wonderful things. What if it was just a bad alien posing as a good person interfering with me. 

If the governments has knowledge of aliens for over a century, and the vatican was invovled then there might be a better explination for relgion. This could explain my psychosis, and those alike. Why I was talking to a voice in my head. What was this voice inside my head that wasn't mine, and where was it coming from? How did did it tell me the truth, and then watch me intentionally suffer? 

Then you would also have to think maybe that this was God trying to talk or contact me, and that I'm not all insane. What happened just got confused when I was arrested, and I got arrested because they thought I was on LSD when I was schizophrenic having an episode. I didn't do anything illegal, and got arrested for resisting arrest when they had no crime on me to arrest me with. So then maybe some of it could have been true, but just misunderstood by society so much that I was arrested for it.",7,1

I want a genuine connection and you can't really get that from a ""if anyone wants to message me hmu"" interaction on the internet. Though to be honest I'd be down for any kind of irl friendship even if it's not that intense. 

When trying to use apps made specifically to make friends in my area the apps ALWAYS glitch out somehow. I mean this in no exaggeration. I'm not saying thank sign up for these apps and nobody swipes I'm saying that EVERY time there are insane technical issues stopping it from working. From it telling me there's no memory when I have 3gb free and the app is miniscule, to the app just refusing to believe me when I say it has permission to upload a picture. A very common one is I'll put up the most crystal clear photo of myself and the app tells me that it's a bad quality photo or not even trust that it's a picture of a person. I'm not even ugly, I'm fairly attractive, so what the hells the problem can cameras just not handley ethereal handsomeness or is almost every app under the same weird bias? I'll see people with profile pictures that's just a movement blur mess of their own dog. 

I've done everything in my power. Im considering looking into wizardry and wiccan stuff to try and find outside power to get maybe even an acquaintance.

101,148f7sz,Working from home,"I am just writing to share my experience here in case it helps anything.

I work for a pharmaceutical company. My clients include a producer of an antipyschotic drug and a mobile health app. The mobile health app has recently been updated and the new version tested in a clinical trial. This coincided perfectly with my increasing paranoia of employee monitoring software to the point I had a full scale mental breakdown. I didn't sleep or eat for 4 days, and have not really been right since.

My delusions led me to believe I was taking part in a clinical trial, where we were developing a new digital solution that allowed the patients to uncover repressed memories.

I believed that the work I was doing wasn't actually real, and that the clients and co-workers we're all involved in the clinical trial as undercover support staff. When I was working on the laptop, prompts and notifications would happen as a direct result of my activity (if I was writing a good email, the green arrows from the Microsoft Watchlist Stocks and Shares Widget would appear, if I was doing a mistake, the down red arrow would appear. The weather widget represented my managers emotion, rain for sadness, thunder for trouble etc.)

I came to believe that the technology was built to increasingly build connections between your behaviour and the prompts until a physiological break occurs. You'd be forced into a detached state away from your laptop. During which, your connections would re-establish themselves to repressed memories and you'd remember past traumatic experiences. 

In my case, I walked through the kids section at a supermarket and later saw someone looking at a bottle of whisky. At that point it clicked , I remembered that my grandad was a drunk who had abused me and that was the reason for whatever my issues had been.

My girlfriend had been looking after me at the time and it became apparent that she was also involved in this. She was secretly a 36 year old nurse (I figured it out because she once told me a story that her friend was going out with a 28 year old, but when she looked at his passport he was really 36). 

I made more and more connections which proved my suspicions. Anyone who disagrees was in on it in some way. The mental health unit that helped me were so efficient and helpful there was no possible way they could have not been involved. 

It reached the point where I realised I was actually 36, my family had all died in an accident, my girlfriend was also dead (possibly when she went on holiday on her own) and I had steadily gone mad in isolation.

Eventually I realised that I was in fact dead, or perhaps in a coma. traffic lights and car indicators were signs I was doing a good job or a bad job (while on life support). 

Anyway, I'd been prescribed medication at that point and it slowly started to work. Within a few weeks, I was functioning again and touch wood everything has been okay. 

It seemingly came out of nowhere, and for a few days something was violently pulling me into another reality. I was spiraling to find an answer how this could be happening to me, and the reasons became more and more insane as I fell into it. The rip cord the whole time was just ' You've lost your mind', but I could never accept that. 

It was a life changing event and everything is much better now. Ultimately, the main paranoia that I am going to die, my family are all going to die and my girlfriend is going to die is actually true, and the uncertainty is built in around that. You find connections to orientate yourself but they're only as real as you perceive them to be, but it's just something you have to live with. 

I don't know if this helps anyway but I hope it does, take it easy and try not to fret too much!",1,1

I was 11, I don't remember what grade I was in but I think it was somewhere in middle school. This town was very tiny and so was my school. We had one lady to talk to if someone bullied us or if anything else happened. But at one point we also got a psychiatrist who stayed for a pretty long while. I remember talking to him a lot of times. I had ADHD which I only got diagnosed with until recently. But at this time I had no idea. I went through a lot of tests and he did one on me. He came to the conclusion that I was schizophrenic after only a short amount of time, at least compared to the time and effort it takes to diagnose someone who actually is schizophrenic. I am 16 now and when I think about this I genuinely get mad and I don't understand how people in these types of positions have gotten there.

110,1484ylr,After Psychosis,"Hello!
I was hoping to get some info on how recovery looks after a psychosis episode. My boyfriend recently was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and is currently on a hold getting treatment. The medications seemed to have helped a bit in relation to the voices and hallucinations, and he really wants to leave the facility which I don’t blame him for. However, when I visited today, while he seemed stable it also seemed like he didn’t know what direction he wanted his treatment to go and expressed wanting to “just leave” which was concerning as we have tried to get him to a few residential places and he has a pattern of leaving when he has a period where he feels like he doesn’t need treatment. I’m not sure exactly what the doctor’s stance is on discharging him right now except that they will extend his hold as they have not issued any paperwork for discharge. It may just be that we have not been able to find another program for him, but I don’t want to have him transferred only for him to leave in the middle again and start the process from the top. He says he’ll stick to his medication but again, it seems more like as a way to get out of the facility than actively committing to some sort of recovery plan. It’s especially important because he has a history of substance abuse as well.

I just want to say I read every comment when I woke up a little bit ago. I'm feeling more stable. But when my wife came in and asked if I took my meds yet and I said no she said if I cared about her at all I'd take them. I still hesitated and she left my room. I do not deal well with ultimatums, threats etc. She was angry with me and I could hear it in her voice.

My mil wanted to talk to me a few minutes ago. She asked if I'd been taking my meds I said no. She calmly explained without anger or threats like my wife why I needed to take them and how the voices don't control what I do only I do. She asked me if I would take them in front of her. I dont know why but I went and grabbed them sat down in the living room and after putting them in my hand she saw me struggling and just gently reminded me to ignore anything they were saying to me at the moment and to just listen to her and that I was safe the pills would help etc. She said she could tell I was very close to neededing inpatient and she really didn't want me to go through that again.

I was able to take them. It was so fucking hard to do and I'm shaking still from the nerves. But I did it. I'm gonna just take them in front of someone so that I know they are getting taken since I'm not able to do so myself. 

I'm alot more clear today then yesterday, it's worse at night for me. I see my psychiatrist on the 22nd they can't get me in sooner I called and asked. So I'll let her know what happened with the meds, my drinking etc so we can monitor things.

I'm scared but I do have a support system here at home I just need to start being more honest about what's going on.

-------------------------------------------end of update





I feel like I'm halfway out of my body. Their are voices whispering a strange language. I can see them walking around outside black figures slowly walking. I can't explain this shit I'm sorry it's hard I'm so confused. I haven't been taking my psych meds for I think 3 weeks could be more days are blurring together in such a way I can't pinpoint it.i stopped taking my meds because I firmly believe they are poisonous and will kill me if I keep taking them. So I stopped plus I was drink a fair amount at the time so also I figured the combo would kill me faster. I mean some days that sounds nice but most days I don't want to die.

Anyways I broke because tonight is the worst I've been in a couple years. I told her I stopped my meds and she fuckig told me I either take my meds or we breakup be ause she cant handle being with someone who is so unstable like this. 

I cant take them damnit. She doesn't get it. My mil is fucking threatening to try to get me to the ER for a psych hold. But I'm not a fucking danger to myself the voices are just telling me to have a drink(I'm trying to quit) or dump the psych meds down the toilet so no one can make me take them. My wife literally said she would watch me take them to be sure I was taking them everyday.  Nah the walls are already watching me I don't need someone trying to control what I put into my body. 


I honestly don't know what to do. The nurse advice line through my insurance said ER now. No fucking way I have a fear of leaving my house I don't like the psych wards they are worse then jail imo. All they fucking do is feed you pills, and take away all your freedom.

144,147nvr9,Schizophrenic Episodes and Care,"  

**My close friend has suffered with schizophrenia since long before I met her. I know she uses far more alcohol than she should and has also used methamphetamines previously in life. Since long before coming and staying at my house, she routinely spends multiple hours wailing in agony, excessively closed off, angry, and/ or constantly reliving the same scenes over repeatedly in a predictable schedule and timeline of about a 7–10-day cycle. Drinking hard alcohol makes the multiple individual aspects become increasingly vocal and her reactions worse. She is unable to communicate at least 4 of her 8 to 12 hours awake each day lately. She recently had even more complicated episodes that may have been leading to even more dangerous delusions. When she drinks certain malt beverages or drinks more than two low carb beers then that is she starts to have voices talking down to her. There have been several occasions I had to send her daughter away with family. I have been extremely close to requesting medical services, and then she asks to just sleep. I have been to the point where I believed law enforcement may need to be involved. It can be traumatizing, especially when her daughter, who is 5 years old, already has habits and techniques for navigating her mommy’s illness routine cycles. She is one of the only people able to get through to her mother at certain stressful moments. When I came into their lives, she was truly the only one that comprehended her mother’s cycles better than most, and most importantly, how to communicate with her mother. I found that the more knowledgeable I have become about the illness, the easier it is for me to set aside emotional reaction when she begins seeking reactions from off the wall comments. I have recorded many of her conversations and took notes on the script of many more. Although, it is still very difficult. Some days are good, some days are not so terrible.** 

**I’ve had nightmares of the voices and comments of she stating they were trying to kill me, and she has nightmares that cause her to scream and yell in her sleep. I haven’t heard any suicidal admissions and have attempted to communicate my concerns with her. My mental health, career transition, my family, and multiple relationships have all been affected, among other things. Sometimes I feel trapped by her mental illness because she threatens to leave, and I do not believe leaving her alone to care for her daughter without additional supervision is the responsible or sensible decision. This illness has been a roller coaster of emotions, hurt, financial burden, pain, confusion, hopelessness, struggle, tears, anger, and exhaustion. I can’t begin to comprehend the trials she must undergo each day. Society has made people with these types of mental illnesses turn out to be dangerous bad people. I agree she is challenging. Most definitely. Bad? Not always. She has a good heart and does her best to care for her daughter. It’s sad to watch someone suffer with this and know there is little I can do to help. So, I help care for her daughter and listen to her challenges when she can share. She has been prescribed the same medication in a single dose once a month as well as some medications for her thyroid.**

**I know forcefully encouraging her will only cause her to close off. We have a meeting with her doctor soon. What are some important topics we could discuss to potentially lead to improving her overall?** ",3,1
145,147r0x0,Need advice on helping a loved one without losing their trust,"i have someone in my life who i believe is going through an episode of psychosis (they have diagnosed schizophrenia). they’ve started taking their meds again for over a week now but the delusions are still there. i’m very worried for them and they’re pushing away everyone else in their life. i seem to be one of the few people they trust and i don’t want to lose that trust. i know the stuff they’re posting on social media is concerning other people in their life as well. i want to help them without making them think they can’t trust me anymore.

edit: should i just wait it out and hope the meds start working soon? i’m currently talking to family members who have reached out to me to try and figure out what to do but even they’re at a loss, especially since he’s cut off a few of them completely. it’s such a delicate situation cause i’m trying to help him without losing his trust cause if he’s not telling these things to me, he’s not telling them to anyone. i’ve promised him i would never call a wellness check on him or request a psych hold and it is important to me to keep that promise. he has not posed a threat to himself or others so i don’t think it’s necessary but i honestly am in the dark on what other interventions there are here",2,1

I still to this day don’t know exactly where he went or why he left. I thought he was being dramatic and I didn’t understand exactly what was going through his mind. He broke his phone before this. He would say people were hearing his calls, etc. I miss him a lot. I am slowly realizing he was asking me for help without directly asking for help. I feel horrible.

186,1479sgk,Considering switching back to the long-lasting injectable,"**Background**: I used to take the Risperdal injectable, then switched to the Ability injectable due to severe akathisia. I switched to a high dose of Risperidone oral due to side effects, then was cut off from meds without notice cold turkey, and have resumed on a low (1mg daily) dose since January, lowered from 4mg initially after severe akathisia and dyskinesia.

So I am restarting college this fall after having mid-semester psychosis (once due to withheld meds) twice previously, causing me to fail my classes.

My positive symptoms are not severe, but worsen with stress and anxiety, and I know it will impact my performance, especially with the extreme lethargy I get from even just 1mg of the oral dose.

It's been 3 years since I've been on any injectable, and I figured switching back would help maintain stability throughout the semester, and it would be better to start the switch now so I can adjust before school starts. However,I have some concerns:

* What is your experience with tiredness with the injectable vs oral meds?

* Has anyone experienced akathisia with any injectable, and, if so, which ones?

* Does anyone have experience with or recommendations for supplements, nootropics, other meds to request, etc, that have helped offset side effects of your injectable?

* I have a bupropion (Wellbutrin, 300mg daily) prescription that helps offset side effects 9f current oral meds. Does anyone have experience taking it with the injectable?

Just yesterday, when I was driving I thought I hit a 🐈‍⬛ black cat. But it was just the shadow casted from the street lights. The entity chased me. It always in front of me. I can’t closed my eyes when I was driving. Goosebumps paralysed me from doing anything. It was cold and eerie. 

Suddenly, it jumps at my back passenger seat. The eyes 👁️ so many eyes in fact. I don’t see it clearly. But whenever I passes through a street light, I can see it’s figure. Trying to reach me. Trying to say something to me. I know it’s in the back of my mind. I was panicking. Ever so slightly, tears started coming out.

I was talking to someone on the phone. But I was just afraid to act/say something that I only experienced. Reality is only when someone sensed them right? I just ask him to talk more. I really wanted to ask help.. 

The moment I arrived at home. It still there. The gaze getting stronger as if it doesn’t want me to move an inch. I hang up my phone and screamed at the top of my lung. It was liberating. 

I ran into my home. And took a very deep breath. It felt like my lungs is expanded many times. Catching breath was difficult. So I sat and practice the 4-7-8 breathing. I was ok after some time.

197,146p1q2,Greetings! I’m glad I found this community. It feels lonely to see other people who have a “normal” mental state… I don’t have anybody to relate to in my life.,"I was diagnosed about 5 years ago, at first I refused to accept it. I refused to take my medication and as a result spiraled into ways of thinking that denied reality. After many terrifying hospital visits I finally accepted the truth and began taking my medication religiously, and I’m proud to state that I haven’t had to go to the hospital for over a year now. Sometimes I wish I had a normal brain and get bogged down by comparing myself to people whose lives seem to just “work” for them. I lost a lot of friends because a lot of them didn’t know how to deal with my ramblings and delusions, but the good ones stuck around. 

Anyone else get the “why me?” attitude?

Also, sometimes I’m afraid of healthy/everyday things in my life. I’m always worried that my mind is playing tricks on me like it has in the past..

It’s also really hard to find what I believe about religion/spirituality because of how many “alien” and “demonic” experiences I’ve had. It’s trained me to be a skeptic and sometimes I don’t like that about myself. But that’s the reality of it. I’m worried to even think about the concept of god or spirituality because I fear it could tip me over the edge… and I’m part of a very religious community so most of the people around me have thought I was demon possessed at some point; which doesn’t help.

I'm about as stable as I ever am right now. I recently escaped near/borderline/possible psychosis. But, sometimes, I miss the familiarity of just staying up for a week and doing nothing but pacing, obsessing, and watching the spies.

Obviously, I wouldn't miss it if I was in it because it fucking sucks... I can't explain it very well. ""Better the devil you know than the devil you don't."" There is some comfort in familiarity, even if it's horrible and agonizing.

There's a lot of instability and unknown in my life right now. I'm dealing with major life changes (e.g., I'm homeless with no income after leaving an abusive relationship).

I have BPD and, with that, quite often, have self-destructive tendencies under extreme stress. Hurting myself is a coping mechanism for me. It's a distraction.

But, right now, I really do wish I could just stop taking my meds and see where it goes (as a serial med-quitter, I know where it goes and don't intend to do it). I am under so much stress and Murphy's Law is wreaking havoc on all of my best efforts. I kind of want to give up. But that isn't an option.

I've been on Abilify, Seroquel and Haldol, currently Haldol and self tapering Seroquel. Abilify didn't worsen my cognition, but I think that Seroquel did very severely, that's why I'm tapering. Haldol at this dose gives me no side effects, but I've read that it can cause episodic memory impairment (which I for sure have to a large degree as well) and that ironically, nicotine could relieve it.

225,146osxi,yesterday night i feared to fall asleep.,"but luckily, my symphtoms are still confined in this moment of my day, at least, the most part of them are. so i am stubborning against taking olanzapine everytime.
i wanna do an analysis

 -in the measure i'm able to do it, of course, i'm not forcing anything: the followings will be hypothesis, wich i'll share with my analyst to discuss em-

 of my unconscious ""publicly"" 

(nobody knows my IRL identity here, so i feel safe sharing things i don't like to admit neither to myself, and these are exactly the thoughts that unconscious try to underline, sometimes scolding me as an abusive adult, sometimes mocking me as a moron children -most of the time is the latter, but tonight it was an abusive adult... female, and there were also a teen male).

everytime i am in that phase, when i'm near to fall asleep and i lose the grip with reality... but still not in the dream world, voices haunt me, and last night  they were scary.

first time i started hearing casual, disconnected one from the other, pieces of conversation between two/three adults, they were talking about somebody elses problems (cause i didn't find any legit reason to think it was something related to me).
then, as they saw i was too much chilling, -like the kids who did something wrong, but they act fine until somebody point at it-
... they started playing the ""good policeman"" in a certain way. like during my e.d. hospitalization at 8.
so, they started saying ""poor her!"" (caressing with heavy hands my face and hairs) ""what have they done to you? say it"" ... it felt paralyzing, nobody has ever been my friend there (during E.D.. they always played this game, faking i was the victim, pimping me, to let me spill out something wrong about my family, and then implicitly blaming me because of that, using my own words against me.)
so, everytime i became aware what was going on (last night) i was so scared i suddenly went back to be awake, and voice went silent. 
when i was falling asleep the second time, they started doing one of the typical italian gestures: back of hand to palm of the other hand, repeatedly smacked (usually, in real life, one time is enough, but these people were extremely theatral and repetitive -also in the hospital 🤡- so im the contrary of surprised. from the other side: i am myself a bit theatral and i tend to crawl in my diseases, enlarging them.). the gesture express something like ""i would've bet"" ""it's unfair, but it doesn't surprise me"". it's used when in a conversation, you already predict something in the narrative will go in a negative way, and you prove yourself right because it happen. it's something like ""don't you say?? always happen, i would've bet"". 

woke up.

again, next time i was falling asleep, the sound of smacking hands was around my thighs, and i saw literal hands smacking my thighs in a ""half/dream"" state.

woke up again, terrified.

the voices were telling that everything will comes to light, humming.
when i fell half-asleep again, they touched heavily my hairs, in the dream image i had a tail and i was laying aside on the left side. hands caress heavily my tuft of hair free from the tail, and they say ""you can go now. you're free, you can go now.""

... i don't know how to interpret it, but it was as abusive as the rest of the things because technically i am already where i want to be, despite i'd like to go elsewhere autonomously. im trying to sleep in my bed. does it imply im trying to sleep in a cage? that i'm not free? 

and actually, when i woke up i actively tried to think about ""sugar"" the system of a down song, because despite the song tells about the problems of this guy who is in an abusive relationship and is abusive himself in many ways, not only for the romance side, despite that, the melody is pretty relaxing, audio is good quality and it doesn't scare me at all. so i started repeating in my mind, consciously, the part:
"" *y'know that everytime i try to go where i really wanna be, is already where i am... CAUSE IM ALREADY THEEEEEERE* ""
... and it worked as a harp against ""ginger"" or ""dam""... but not against voices.

again, i was half asleep, and i felt the sensation of the plastic sitting for the wc. i hate the plastic sitting. so i raised it, and i peed sitting on the ceramic.
they reproduced the sound of pee, but i didn't need to go, my hallucination use this kind of thing to say me that i'm faking to be trans because sometimes im lazy and i pee sitting instead of standing up.

so, after that, they were a group of adults.
many women, one guy with a high pitch voice

-like those who are early in the puberty process, but not child anymore.-

while the women laughed, the guy said again, (same of the last time):
""she believes! she even believes!"" in a scoffing/jeering way.

... at this point i wrote to my analyst, not because i hope he answer me at 3am, but because doing so i stop the chain, because i demonstrate myself that im completely aware of whats happening and i gain control on the situation.
i described everything in the order wich it happened.

this morning i woke up after a fine dream, nothing haunting, and the background song was ""natural born killer"" wich i LOVE because once in a while it's against the other ones, and not against myself.

my hypothesis is that my ""cis female inner self"" is scolding me, because she were already an adult since 11 for many reason... and fought to be recognized as one of them.
she fought against stereotipization,
she fought against sexism and double standards.
and now im putting a patch, indulging society's problems, because being a female eunuch who does steroids and resistance training so she becomes huge would've meant being *constantly* under the judging eye and inside the judging mouth of people and i never beared it.

now. this is the narrative of a fictional opposite side, i created on my own, to feel guilty of something... but actually,for the sake of telling the other side of the true story, my ""cis female"" self of the 4th year lyceum was

- aware of double standards and sexism, yes

- but she already indulged them 

(she feared to be called a slut for her entire life, since 11, she wasn't able to have pleasure anymore, she needed a pill to function as a woman, and at the same time felt like a men in dress when attending women-only spaces, because she was already probably on the other side of the power contention, and she behaved already, sometimes, exactly like men: 

- minimizing, ""i don't see it as a real problem/ it's not so much of a struggle afterall, there are bigger problems in the world""

- denying ""it's a completely made up problem, it doesn't exist, we're already equal"" 

- proving right the other side ""eh, she seeked for that"" (SA) / ""you're seeking attention"" (everything else) / ""youre throwing excuses"" (period's cramps, wich i didn't have); 

i was an enemy for myself, and for women. and now that im under testosterone i can reason slightly better when it comes to women problems in society because i'm not involved anymore, and by watching externally i have a better sight.

actually, i think that im still a bit auto-suggestioning myself, so this could be not the final message of my unconscious yet:
this is my hypothesis but i always thought it pretty consciously, ive always been aware ""in the background of my mind"" from the start, that my dysphoria is the result of a cursed experience with womanhood that started in the childhood, and grew prosperously, according to the social situtation of my first sexual relationship, and according to the further environment i met. 
anyway i needed to take this off my chest.
hope it can help, obviously putting your own context in place of mine.

for your interest, i'm still willing to transition despite my problem is not an innocent, innate, biological condition of the brain: am i evil? yes i am. am i a moron? no im not:
 i choose to be happy, because it doesn't matter the reason why it started: once it became somatic, working on it only through talking therapy and benzos is like drinking more water when you have kidney filtration under 35 (egfr) : it doesn't change the situation, you need dyalisis, and a new kidney. there's no space anymore for preventin it to get worse: it has just to be replaced.",1,1

228,146kf8t,Looking for some advice and maybe your perspective,"Okay, this is a long story, but I'll do my best to make it short and sweet.

I met a girl 2 years ago and we hit it off fast. After hanging around each other for a few months I made a move and we started dating. Things were great. I felt a connection like no other, and after dating for 7-8 months I felt I fell for her. Though there was always something concerning me at times. I never gave it much thought, however, it started getting weirder as time went on.

&#x200B;

When we'd hang out I first noticed sometimes words would completely change her mood.

If I said things like, my bad, whoops, how's your day? among other phrases she'd get very mad at me and shut down. She'd also ask me not to say those things around here. I wasn't sure why and I tried to be understanding. As time went on it happened more and more. I'd drink water and she'd get mad and say am I toxic or something? I was like what? She told me, well you're drinking water, so you must be real thirsty. I was like actually I am it's hot out. She wouldn't believe me though, she really thought I had hidden meaning or insults when I'd speak. 

&#x200B;

As this started to happen more I began to get a little confused. Then things got really weird for me.

She asked me to come over to where she was staying, which was at her parents' house. 

Things were great and no one was home but us. Then out of no where she told me they turn the AC vents on to punish her and that they all use coughing as a way to tell her she's not welcome there anymore. I really wasn't sure what to believe but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I said okay that's not cool.  Not long after this she suddenly tells me her step dad is a serial killer and that the family poisons her. I was like you need to go to the police station.

&#x200B;

She was like I can't they run the police station too. It's all a big connected mess against me.

I was honestly scared because I didn't know what was happening. She wasn't on drugs because I would' have seen something considering the amount of time we were together. 

At this point I tried to make an excuse to go because I felt a little uncomfortable.

She suddenly told me I can't because she felt paralyzed by the tap water and I have to watch her body to make sure no one touches her. I said I could bring her to the hospital but she was very angry at me for even suggesting. As you can imagine things didn't go well and I left.

Things seem to go back to normal and she was her usual self I loved.

We spent more time together but then she'd flip like a switch and things would go haywire on me

This went on for a long time and I was honestly very confused. I started distancing myself a bit because I was honestly not sure what to do. I tried bringing stuff up to her but she'd call me a liar and toxic. Then one day she said she'd join the military since I wasn't giving her the attention she wanted. She'd serve her country. I said I'd support whatever she wanted to do. Then she tells me she got denied. Showed me a bunch of paperwork very angry saying they lied about her and her family was in on it to ruin her.

&#x200B;

I was like wait what is going on? She shows me the paperwork and it said delusional disorder, psychotic disorder, ptsd, and anorexia.  Plus she had medication in her system in her blood work I looked up later that said it was for schizophrenia. I never knew anyone with this before but as I looked it up things started to make sense. I felt like I finally could see a bit more of her perspective.

I felt absolutely terrible for distancing myself and all but she really confused me and I couldn't really communicate with her. I still don't know if she has schizophrenia of course, but I know it is a possibility. Also having said that it didn't make me feel any different about her. I still love her even as I write this. So I tried to be understanding and all but I was still keeping a little distance because I was still not sure what to do at the time. 

&#x200B;

At this point she started working at my job, and so I was around her every single day for months.

Things were very tough because some days she'd be very different than others. She'd be herself and other days she'd accuse me of being her enemy and everything else she could say. It hurt me because I just wanted to be there for her and I couldn't be. 

&#x200B;

Flash forward to now, I told her regardless of what she's going through I do love her and care abot her. And that I'm here for her if she ever needs me for anything. I guess that was the wrong words to use because shedid a 180 on me and said I was stupid and toxic. She said I was as bad as her parents and didn't care and wasn't her friend. From that point on she still worked at my job, but she refused to talk to me or even be around me. I respected her decision and left her alone.

&#x200B;

Then out of no where she is flirting  with me again and trying to get my attention like nothing happened. I try to talk to her about it then she is like we aren't friends don't talk to me anymore. I can't talk to you in my life right now. So I don't. Then she comes and does it all over to me and I told her I really don't understand what she wants.

&#x200B;

Anyways I'm sorry for the long winded post. I'm just having a hard time.

It's been very rough the last 1-2 years and I feel lost. What do I do?

What should I do?  I have so much confusion and so many conflictings things going on with her.

I can't exactly quit because I need my job. We work in a small store so not a lot of co workers besides us. But I can't keep going in these circles with her. She hates me one day and wants me to leave her alone, but then the next talks to me like shes my friend.

&#x200B;

I guess I just wanted to hear you all out and if there's anything you can offer in your perspective or experience that may give me better wisdom than I have now. Because now I feel like my brain is mush.",2,1

230,146k35t,I took my meds today (starting again) !! Time off was hard but please encourage me to keep going.,"I had my daughter and second child almost 3 months ago. During pregnancy I don't have nearly any symptoms so I got out of the habit.

When she was born I was floating, but it soon became really rough really fast because she has severe acid reflux (who knew babies could get that??) which might not sound so bad but in a newborn with weak muscles and poor reflexes, it means she was full on choking on it several times a day, and I literally needed to be aware and alert to save her life during those jump scare moments. 

I have another post about the time I needed to call 911 for her. She's not my first, and my son was nothing like this level of stress. Now she's on a medication that is helping lessen these moments to few and far between, but, for the time we didn't know what was wrong yet, I was only able to exist. Medication for my own self went further down the list of my priorities than it's ever been before. 

Someway, somehow, we are all still here, me included. My mind went dark and twisty, folks, probably developed a new layer on my CPTSD cake, but I know if anyone might understand the extra stress this has brought on my stability, it's you right here. 

They need me to be the best version of myself. That's a medicated me, as much as I wish I didn't need to just swallow the damn truth with this glass of water today.

Without antidepressants I am incapable of functioning (wellbutrin) I have been psychotic before the most recent episode being when I stayed up for only 2 days(history of back to back all nighters since middle school and all nighters since I was 11) and began to hallucinate in a way that I could not explain other than the world became saturated,I interpreted music I had not heard before as music I have chopped and combined in messed up ways,I saw a purple cloud that kept changing into different shapes and figures of varying importance to me,sometimes random shit like the image of the beatles I have in my head(I knew it was them how you know what you see in your dreams even if it looks wrong in terms of accuracy) those are the worrying symptoms ig. 
The risk factors that worry me are my schizophrenic grandmother in combination with extreme childhood trauma from the age of 3 including my second ever memory,social isolation throughout my entire life,trauma in my adolescence as well as self inflicted trauma from things done in a presumably manic state causing massive guilt as well as an abusive girlfriend who sent me into a psychotic episode multiple times and led to thousands in medical bills. Also I have been talking to God because I don't believe in him but I'm so scared and paranoid he's real,also since like November of last year when people are talking and I can't hear them I think they're talking about me and sometimes even hear my name or insults when it's not said. I'm missing some stuff that's important but I just want to know if I should bring this up with my psychiatrist. I don't think I have adhd because while the meds make me more focused and capable in a way that's objective they also make me feel hyped up,but I don't know if that's the case or if they just make me feel agitated + jittery + restless and I do really have adhd. I am constantly fearful and while sometimes I am fine other times I am always looking over my shoulder. I am self aware of how some stuff I do would be perceived as strange but I think of it as less strange than others seem to. Help help help help

244,1462lt0,My friend told me I don't have Schizophrenia,"Earlier tonight I was playing games with some friends and one of them was doing stuff and then pretending it didn't happen and calling me a schizo (which btw I'm ok with this, I don't care if people know or make jokes about me being schizophrenic so long as they don't know/joke about the specifics about it. The most I tell people that aren't my psychiatrist and counselor is that I have it.) 
This prompted another friend (call him luke or something idk) to say he was speaking to a coworker today about how one of his friends has schizophrenia because they work in a pharmacy, and because of their conversation he doesn't believe I have schizophrenia. Specifically he thinks this because he doesn't think it really affects me, specifically because he knows I don't have delusions of grandeur, which according to his friend is required to have schizophrenia, and because I was diagnosed at 17 (I'm 18 now) which is really rare. 

I know it's stupid and he doesn't know what he's talking about nor does he have the full picture, but it feels like I'm lying. The things I've experienced due to my schizophrenia have caused me to lose 2 jobs, and to ruin a 2 year old relationship. But at the same time it feels like those things are entirely my fault and I've just misattributed them to my Schizophrenia as an easy excuse.

262,145zakr,I'm dating someone with schizophrenia and bipolar. Questions about apathy and what I can do to help in certain situations.,"So I met a guy around 28 yrs old, and I really liked him, thought he was very interesting and attractive so we exchanged info like phone numbers and such. After a few weeks he casually brought up he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar. I was a little caught off guard bc he didn't act like someone that I had the impression one would act if they were schizophrenic. But I had already developed some feelings by that point so it was absolutely not a deal breaker for me. 

So it's going around 2 months since we met. He lives a little far from me so we see eachother about twice a week and talk daily. What makes things difficult is that he comes across as very hot and cold. One minute he wants to be in a relationship with me wants me to even move in with him (which was definitely a little weird bc it's way too soon, also even talked about us having kids). It just seemed like he was very excited to start something. Then the next minute he will want us to be beat friends that are intimate lol which is basically the same thing only without the lables...overall he is just constantly going back and forth with what he says he wants and how he acts. One day he will be incredibly sweet, affectionate and really just an epic sweetheart. The next day he will be very, very distant and even act a little awkward, will intentionally not even want to kiss. Rather than take any of this personally, I'm trying to be understanding and patient while also very much guarding myself from falling for someone who seems to be very unsure of what he wants out of this. In the meantime I want to learn more about schizophrenia and what to expect from someone who is struggling with this who I care for and would love to be a person that is there for him and supportive, even if it turns out romantically things die out.

Question about apathy: I've learned this is a common symptom and it's something he recently has struggled with. The other day when I went to visit him, it was the opposite of a few days prior where he was incredibly affectionate and sweet the entire day. Instead he was distant, almost anti social and seemed like he couldn't wait for me to leave. After I left I sent him a text saying ""you seemed like you couldn't get rid of me quick enough. I don't know if I did something to annoy or piss you off but if I did, I'm sorry."" He said not at all and he was glad I came. I told him ""well I will just have to take your word for it bc I can't read minds (he's expressed that he believes people can read minds before) so I can only go off the vibe which felt totally off"". He said he felt the vibe too and felt a wave of depression as he watched me leave but he appreciated that I didn't get angry with him for the way it was. Anyway, the next night, pretty late, he kept calling me over and over and right after saying hey, he would just hang up. This happened a few times in a row before I got annoyed and stopped answering the calls. I sent him a text instead that asked ""are you ok?"". He wrote back ""off the record?"" And then said ""I can't think, I can't feel, I can't kill myself. What am I supposed to do call my mother? I love her like an angel"" ( he also has a thing with angels). I sent him some texts trying to be supportive and told him to call me again if he needs to talk. But I didn't get any response or hear anything at all until around noon the next day. My last text was ""I'm here for you no matter what, if you need anything at all I got you. I care about you as a person and friend and I'm a little worried about you. So please get back to me when you get this just to let me know if you're ok"". When he responded around noon it was a smiley face and the way he communicated after that he seemed fine.

-So, when you experience apathy, how long does it usually last?

-In the moment, I know apathy means you really don't care about anything or anyone but that doesn't mean you will permanently stop caring about a person right?

-When experiencing apathy and you are reaching out for help, what is something someone who is in your support group can do to help?

-I got nervous about the ""I can't kill myself"" part that he texted me but he has never ever expressed any intention of harming himself before. Is it common to think about suicide while experiencing apathy?

-In general, is this just a bad idea on my part, to even involve myself? I can't help that I do care about him. And I genuinely WANT to be there for him. But is it pointless and doomed? Like, will he eventually get to a point where he just wants to entirely isolate himself from me for good?

Any thoughts or insights, I would be incredibly grateful. I'm literally on my way to visit him for the day right now. I have no idea what to expect, what kind of day we will have. I'm ok with that even though it gives me a little anxiety. Bc when it's good it's amazing and what makes it all worth it.",3,1
263,1461vh5,why does it feel like I don't have psychosis,"i have frequent hallucinations and delusions (maybe a bit less now cause of nasty meds), but it feels like none of it was real, or that it didn't even happened, but then i have a psychotic break, and i can't even distinguish between reality and what's not real, but i get myself doubting that it happened .i don't know why that happens, does anyone have this type of feeling?

264,145ur1w,Does anyone find their voices controlling?,"Like in the cartoons when a ghost takes over someone and they don't have control. 

I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia btw. But there are some things that I won't disclose that the voices make me do. Like they take control of my body and I just get to sit and watch through my own eyes the negative things they do. 

I'm in hospital at the moment due to the voices but yea with speaking with the docs and having them asking the right questions I've begun to understand ""hey it's not me that's doing these bad things"" and I feel so guilty afterwards too. Like I feel like I did these things because my physical body did do these things but I had no control. 

An example that shouldn't be triggering is gambling. A few nights back (been in hospital a week so this was whilst I have been in hospital) I gambled half my gov paycheck away and it wasn't until I got a message that I snapped back to reality and told the nurses. Had it not snapped me back I'd have continued going. Another example that shouldn't be triggering is at midnight last night (this has been the scariest) my body whilst I was concious just went we are buying cigarettes. Didn't have my phone or wallet. Didn't know if there was anywhere I could buy cigarettes. Didn't know if there was anywhere open to buy cigarettes. But it wasn't until I went to open the door and it was locked that I snapped back to reality and went oh shit.

There's much more embarrassing examples but I have attempted to be non triggering in my examples. Apologies in advance if this has triggered you as, 1 I didn't mean to, and 2 I recently learnt about verbal/written boundaries since being in hospital. Ie I know physical boundaries like don't touch people etc. But never been taught verbal and written boundaries could be triggering. Especially in a mental health ward. 

Yes we are allowed our phones but I have surrendered it voluntarily each time I get the inkling to gamble or do the more embarrassing things. 

So yea basically does anyone else experience this uncontrollable but concious experiences. Best way to describe it is like the ghost cartoon example I said earlier in the post and something snaps me back into my own body again. All whilst seeing and feeling the negative things happening.",6,1

266,1461i6z,Those in remission from daily symptoms how are you doing now?,"My symptoms started in mid 2019, and were severe enough to land me in the hosiptal numerous times, at times for weeks and once for a month. It was impossible to live a normal life. The fear and anxiety creating viscious cycles which would trigger me into further episodes. Through sheer will, medication,and therapy my symptoms have gone away for the better part of almost two years, and I no longer take medication as of a year or so ago. 
However I recently started seeing someone and had a mini relapse of symptoms due to the anxiety. It only lasted a few minutes but oddly enough I feel better about my recovery knowing that If I was still in those cycles of anxiety and deppression id become symptomatic again. I cut off the relationship for other reasons, and havent had anything arise since. But I want to hear your schizo-affective recovery story (please dont be specific when referring to specific symptoms or beliefs as to avoid any chance of triggering someone else) - Identifying and using CBT to cope with my triggers helped me most and I wish you all to be respectful for others in the forum regardless the stage of their recovery by being careful with what you say, thank you.
Its something that I rarely think about now and it feels almost distant to me like Im looking at it through a stained glass window, as if what happened to me and what I went through happened to someone else, I know I experienced what I experienced; but I feel far past it now enough that Im comfortable enough to try to help others (however I still am careful about triggers as to improve my odds of not relapsing).",2,1

271,145kf8d,How do you deal with people using this illness to unilaterally invalidate your beliefs/ feelings?,"I feel like my parents are so hellbent on the idea that I need medication and hospitalization that they’re grasping at straws to make me feel like I need it too. Of course I have delusions and paranoia. Obviously. But I feel like it’s EVERYTHING I feel or say now. These are things they’ve said to me:

- they want me to go to the hospital bc they’re helping me and I’m not my own doctor so I have no way to definitively know what I need. 

- if they accommodate a trigger, another will pop up in its place and therefore they will never have any idea or indication what will trigger me. 

- we should be able to have a “normal” conversation without things going to left field. 

- I’m always upset when I talk and I constantly “complain” and they “have no way to confirm I’m actually in an episode” so they just say “epi-- moment” every time like I don’t know that they believe I’m in active psychosis. 

This is in response to things like me telling them that I can’t just go to the ER and “demand” proper testing for intestinal issues  because I’m schizophrenic and can literally be admitted to the mental health unit. Or drawing the boundary that I’m 23 and will make my own medical appts at times that are convenient for me and they don’t have to take me to them (“but why would you Uber when you could schedule the appt for when we could take you?”).

How do I cope? I love my parents but it’s making me so depressed with myself that they’re doing this bc of my delusions, which they have vehemently ignored. I want to be able to just not respond and I also don’t want them to decide it’s okay to call emergency services on me or something.

Edit: I’m 23, live with my parents and have just been basically kicked out of college bc I failed too many classes. Can’t work bc of anxiety and concentration issues. I have no income and my disability app has been stuck in the system for a while (applied on march 11, 2022 and have been calling constantly about it). House of 6 and I’m the oldest girl. 

Second edit: Been consistently in therapy for 5 years. Ideations for the last 11 or so, no hospitalizations. My therapist is well aware of everything and agrees that my parents are not being fair. Meds “worked” for me but made me sleep so much or become so dull and unmotivated and gain so much weight that I feel it’s not worth it. I’m managing super well mentally. My physical health is being taken care of but rn I’m in excruciating pain bc gluten. Also, I don’t drive. 

Third edit: Sometimes I forget that my earlier posts aren’t liked to this one, sorry…

I failed 4 classes in a row bc I was dealing with medication withdrawal from my therapy program losing a psychiatrist, and at the same time, insulin resistance was so bad from Abilify/Prozac that in addition to being numbed emotionally and being unable to concentrate as a side effect of meds dulling me, my back gave out under the amount of weight the meds made me keep on. I’ve dieted and all, was on meds for 4 ish years and never weighed in under 230 on medication. 

I was enrolled in classes this term at my school and was doing well in them when 4 weeks in, I was notified that the school, who had given me a whole disbursement from funds that they accepted from my loan servicer AFTER I spoke with them AND my advisor alerting them of the issue and was assured that it wouldn’t be an issue. It was a lie. Because in college, they handle financial aid issues almost a month into the term, and it’s not uncommon to be that far in and learn that your financial aid did not go through and you have to pay for the current AND next term if you wanna continue school. 

As far as why I’d waste money on an Uber, my parents have me the option in early April, after I had not been able to eat for a week bc I was so constipated and in pain and feeling so much general discomfort that I was repulsed by food, to wait until July to see a gastroenterologist or to go to the Emergency Room and demand that they figure out why I was having the issues. I had been to the ER in January, everything “looked normal” even though I’d been bleeding for a month at that point, and they sent me to my PCP. She ordered tests. They were normal so she told me to find a Gastroenterologist. By that time, it felt like an emergency not only to me but to my psych team and my cousin who’s also a nurse. So I made the appt and decided that I’d Uber if I needed to. 

Celiac disease, which is what the gastroenterologist believes may be the culprit, requires blood and or imaging tests. To find the indications of celiac, you have to do a gluten challenge. That means for 8 weeks before you have the testing done, you eat 3-10 g of gluten everyday. My colonoscopy is at the end of the month so if I stop eating gluten, the rest comes back negative and I have to retry.",15,1

The doctors say I'm Schizophrenic but this is a religion thing I'm being attacked because I was atheist then converted to pagan. Loki came to me and offered me a deal which I took ue said I will be attacked for ye rest of my life and he  will help me. It's been 3 years of terror and agony every second of my life it doesn't feel like it me in my own body.the thoughts are gone for the most part but every movement Iake idk if it me and every second of my day I'm thinking"" I here"" .""this is my body"" ."" I'm making this movement. I tried many things to get rid of them and feel like I am in control
 Med do nothing theyade me worse and also gave them more power. The spirits would make me walk in the street at dark. Try to steal cars. And would try to trick me into believing the most ridiculous stuff you can think of like a UFO is going to land in the back yard every night. When I say hundred Iewn hundreds
 I have spoken to sead relatives and they are excited mainly to know about how I am. That ability gone it's just me constantly battling control ovee my own body. Thing like showering are the worse because every movement is like ruck that wasnt me and I'm not washing my own body anymore
 The highest recorded multiple personalities was under 100. My mind did not break it was a flood of evil spirits attacking me and I truly believe that's what schizophrenia, it's just spirits trying to wear you down to the point they can banish your soul from your body and takeover. They would tell me to hurt people andi was Putin a lot of meds after that
 I'm on less meds now and doing a lot better because the main spirit is trying to take over and blocks the others abilities. No place of worship will help me, hey are afraid because at least the religious know this stuff is real and I'm a very scientific person and was told many things about how spirits work scientifically. I could write a whole book on it. But mainly it's through radiation. I don't see thing unless my eyes are closed. But I can see radiation since this began
 Spots on the eye is what it seems like but I can interact with it ans hold it. The good spirit hat tried to help told me this is what easterners call Ki.  But overall I'm at my best but also my very worse because every night my mind goes to other places of existence and I have to fight my way back into my own body. I've been to hell. And they are at war and the lesser demons were freed and that's why you are so much evil in the world now more than ever.  My thoughts are like a faint whisper and myhead jerks  I make faces that arentnme doing it as if the apirit is surprised  still here. Hey will lift my eyebrows up to mock me. They will constantly move my feet at night like restless leg syndrome which I've been checked for. I do not have it.itw like them fighting to take control from the one that has more power over me. They do it as if it's more code or some type of code.while I'm half awake is when they can spela again and they will just say hey or say my first name. Or they will mimic parents voices
 And it's audible like I can record it on my phone I have one time and their voice comes out of my head without my mouth moving. it's like a high vibration turning into a voice
 I'm notakimg any of his of or exaggerating my parents have heard it once and said who was in the house
 The voice is not mine it's a more stern voice
 Also when I dream I'm like living someone else's memories and they are sick minded like pedo stuff and it really bothers me I hate this. Everything just typed I have not seen one case report or study of nor have I seen anyone on a forum say anything remotely likey sotuwtion.

I just thought people were talking slower for some reason and didn't think anything of it.

It wasn't until I put on a song I hadn't heard in a while but was very familiar with that I actually realized why everything seemed off.

The song was SLOW. Way slower than I'm used to.

Ever since I noticed, I've been noticing it with everything else. I do singing as a hobby and I can't get my timing right. I keep starting too early.

Hope everyone is doing well. I started taking 1.5 mg of Vraylar this past Wednesday while titrating down on Zyprexa (currently i am taking about 1.9 to 2 mg a day sometimes even less). The side effect that i am feeling the most is sedation, I am not sure if it's because I am taking it in addition to Zyprexa or because Vraylar itself is also sedating. I was wondering if anyone has experienced sedation as a side effect of Vraylar (like it's pretty severe) and if it goes away with time? Thank you so much, everyone.

287,145lhwn,"Has your circadian rhythm/sleeping pattern changed at all, since you first developed schizophrenia, AKA, what some now call salience?","I recently got off the phone with a relative of mine, who basically [circadian-rhythm](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/sleeping-late-isnt-a-sign-of-laziness-stop-the-circadian-rhythm-shaming) shamed me. I've read that an individual's circadian rhythm is basically genetically ingrained, and that some people are just simply genetically predisposed to sleeping later. From what I can recall, I think it has to do with when humans primarily still existed as hunter-gatherer societies, where some hunter-gatherers were tasked with staying up late to watch for predators. If the many researchers who wrote those articles are correct, then I certainly consider people in society who engage in this kind of behavior to be generally incredibly ungrateful.

But I also feel that since I was diagnosed with schizophrenia that my circadian rhythm has shifted as well. Part of me feels that it might be due to the fact that my perception of time has changed, making me think that there aren't enough hours in the day, leading me to stay up later. Now, I know what the common retort from some would be, ""Well, that's because you're getting up so late!"" but the thing is, I didn't feel this way when I was still in school when I would get up later on weekends before I developed schizophrenia.

It's like people in this country, including your own family members, think that you have no intrinsic value if you're not currently working. I shouldn't be working right now anyway, nor should I have been working before, given that I have to prioritize my physical health anyway (my psychiatrist seems to think that I might be experiencing *severe cumulative* side effects from the medicine I've been taking for years). Initially, the medicine was beneficial and didn't seem to cause any unwanted side effects, but my psychiatrist seems to think that now that I'm slightly older, that my brain is less able to withstand specifically the harmful effects of the drug. In fact, after lowering my dose, we were able to reverse some of those unwanted side effects. That being said, I'm not completely back to my old post-schizophrenia self, and that's why he suggested that I start an exercise regimen, to see if exercise can reverse some of the remaining side effects.

I've read that exercise is the closest thing we have to a miracle drug, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

I know Reddit, at times, can act as somewhat of an echo chamber, especially the political threads (not that I despise talking about politics necessarily), and I'm not here for people to tell me what I want to hear, but for those here who actually suffer from some kind of schizophrenia spectrum disorder, do you feel like your circadian rhythm/sleeping pattern has significantly changed compared to your pre-schizophrenia days?",5,1

But I'm not depressed about having developed schizophrenia. I don't think schizophrenia somehow defines me as a person or somehow replaced my identity. I had no biases about schizophrenia nor knew anyone with it before I got it. I'm depressed from being disabled (not because I'm ""disabled"" - because I can't get 90% of jobs due to being disabled) and transgender (botched operations), which came decades before schizophrenia and isn't something that goes away with a daily pill. Schizophrenia is the easiest to deal with because medicine works for me.

Getting schizophrenia means I need to push back my life plans/dreams a few years yet again, and schizophrenia showed me I'm not getting any younger and could die any day. Anything such as a car crash or cancer could have done the same. I'm not going ""holy crap I might as well die because I'm schizophrenic now"", I'm just going ""great another fucking setback"". I don't have crazy dreams, I just want to live in my dream country. And just to be clear, I'll never give up on my dream of living abroad until I die.

What kind of therapy should I be researching for this? CBT isn't helping. Yes I'm doing the exercises. My schizophrenia was triggered by moving to my dream country for work, both times. The doctors have ordered me to not go abroad for several years. I've simulated a foreign environment at home and it didn't stop me from getting psychosis after the plane landed. I've been to and lived in other countries which weren't my dream country and wasn't triggered. I plan to do an extended vacation there in a few years to see if I'm healed of this trigger. I've changed careers. Ptsd therapy helps with the ptsd but that's a separate issue.",10,1

Instead of being there at all, they've decided to let me go. I know my family will never love me like they can love each other, and they are proud of each other and care deeply for one another. I've never fit in that picture. They wouldn't recognize it but I've always been the outlier and they've never loved or cared for my existence if it didn't benefit them in some way.

296,145ros4,Are they really hallucinations?,"I (28F) have been in discussion with my partner (25F) who is diagnosed schizophrenic, about the possibility of me being schizophrenic. 

I recently (over the last 2 months) have received a diagnosis of ""depression with psychotic symptoms"". I know two things;

* My biological father IS schizophrenic 

* ""They"" (Medical professionals) usually diagnose ""depression with psychotic symptoms"" before anything else. 

That said, I've talked with my partner about some of the stuff I've ""seen"" and ""heard"". I'm diagnosed ADHD, and C-PTSD, both of these come with intrusive thoughts. Couple that with myself, who is a visual thinker. I've always thought that the things I've seen are just something called ""visual intrusive thoughts"". 

For those of you who don't know, a visual intrusive thought is just an intrusive thoughts but rather than words in your brain, it's pictures. 

From what my partner has told me it sounds like I'm actually hallucinating and it's just now starting to get worse. I've been told that it's not always childhood or even teenage years that people see symptoms, but in some cases it can be late 20's to early 30's where some people experience worsening schizophrenic symptoms. 

The hallucinations I'm questioning, I'm unsure if I can explain on Reddit as they're graphic and tend to be a little more violent, and I'm unsure if it would break ToS. Though I can explain a few of the nonviolent ones;

What I had considered a visual intrusive thought;

* There was a day I was discussing something relating to the ocean with an ex of mine. I'm thalassophobic. At some point during the conversation it seemed that my entire ""vision"" had darkened, and it was as if the entire world was gone and I was in an empty, black void (think anime, movies, cartoons, etc when a character goes into a deep thought and it's just them on a black background). Suddenly a shark had appeared and what seemed like it tried to eat me. It was a very quick experience. It felt as if it only lasted a few seconds before I ""came back to"". 

Three other accounts, more recently, over the last two months;

* I was home alone, with my partner on a discord call. I was playing CoD, minding my own business. We were just kind of doing our own thing. I had heard disembodied voices coming from my stairwell. I couldn't make out what they were saying. It was scary enough that I thought I needed self protection. I had grabbed my roommates firearm to investigate and found nobody inside, or by the door leading outside. I called my roommate to explain what happened and he said it might have been the landlord, or the roofers (nobody was around, or in sight). This was my first indication that I might actually be experiencing hallucinations, and what prompted me to talk with my partner about all of this. 


* I was up late one night and couldn't sleep, several weeks ago (I'm an insomnic). I was in bed, in the dark with nothing but my PC's RGB lights for room ambiance. I had seen some dark figure, what seemed like a man, hover over the side of the bed, over my roommate. ""He"" had no lower half, and what seemed like very short, or, no arms. Again it was a fast experience. He disappeared rather quickly. This time my vision didn't go black prior or during.

* That same night, I was looking at the wall, where my plushies were. They were casting small shadows because of the RGB lighting from my PC tower. It felt as if they were breathing very steadily. No sound or anything, just the body motions of breathing in and out. I had observed for a few moments before what seemed like what I can only describe as a shadowed ""tendril"" had appeared on the wall. Once again, it was quick then it was gone. 

One account from just yesterday (June 8th);

* I was walking home with my partner and we were talking about our families. Some time in the conversation I saw a woman walking our general direction on the sidewalk. For but a split second I saw my mother rather than this person which is highly unlikely, if not impossible. My mother is on the other side of the country, and we scarcely talk. She has no reason to be where I am, and, she doesn't even know where I live. 

The other accounts I can't really talk openly about as they're violent (always geared towards me) and again I'm unsure if they'd break ToS. Though I will say is one of them left me in tears for an entire night, and the other had scared the hell out of me enough that I had to stop what I was doing and check the room to see if I was alone (I was). Those two had happened 3 or so years ago. 

I had always figured these were just intrusive thoughts of the visual variant, until my partner started saying they're more akin to hallucinations. 

Before anyone worries, I've already informed my doctor(s), and will be looking into possible medication, depending on what we find with my appointments.",1,1
297,1457wuk,I feel like my life was taken away from me,"I was a gifted child, I had a high intellectual potential like we say in my country.

I started to get a bigger and bigger interest in science and technology and wanted to pass test to study in university but as time went by and I couldn't reach my goals I was destroying myself by self-isolating and not meeting anyone new. At 18 I started working wherever I could without a diploma, hoping that my life would turn around and I would be able to go back to academia and be brilliant again but the day never came. I was not able to keep a job for long and spent half my time on unemployment. I now realize that the goals I had were unattainable and that I have wasted years of my life daydreaming about things happening to me while I couldn't make things happen. I also feel like I have been someone else for those 6 years. As of today I just want to be 16 again and do things right. I don't understand how I have become someone that I despise. I don't understand how my family let me destroy my own life and how they didn't see that something was wrong with me as I stopped seeking help and let myself sink in a hole deeper and deeper.

I have just recently started seeing videos of a Schizophrenia-related youtube channel and the girl was hospitalized in the last couple of days.

301,145klyb,Rant about ableism against psychotic people,"I don't have psychosis myself, (though I'm on the autism spectrum) but it grinds my gears that people are using ""psychotic"" as synonymous with ""dangerous, violent monster"" because that view has nothing to do with the reality of people who deal with psychosis. It literally draws upon the stereotype of mentally ill people being especially violent when in reality they are foremost a danger to themselves when undergoing a psychotic episode.

I've debated someone who is a leftist and uses a lot of left-leaning terms like ""Karen"" and believes that society disfavours poc, sexual minorities etc but made an ableist comment about psychosis.

The context is that we were debating whether it's possible to rehabilitate a teenage girl who along 3 others killed a young girl in a gruesome murder (I was on the positive side) and they said that ""evil"" people can become *""tolerably evil""* at best, *""like neighborhood Karens and office bullies""*. When I told them that even ""bad"" people can have loved ones who they matter to they replied by saying  *""some people who have few if any friends are some of the most kind and gentle people you'll ever meet while there are psychotic monsters are adored by millions""*.   
 Obviously, their statement evokes the image of the crazy, unpredictably violent mentally ill person, whether they meant it or not. I find it not only disgusting that they're evoking a harmful stereotype, but also find it ironic because psychotic people during their episodes have lost touch with reality and believe irrational things, like being the king of England etc. People actually in touch with reality and perfectly neurotypical would be much more succesful at manipulating people through charm and cultivating a positive image.",3,1

He continued to question me with a billion questions and asked me to come again next week and that there might be a possibility that I’m having schizophrenia-like symptoms and wants to see me more often just in case. 

I don’t think it’s offensive to say that I do not want to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, especially when I strongly believe I don’t have it, but he was adamant in saying that my solipsistic thoughts are delusional, and I disagree with him. So here it is, almost exactly as I’ve said in the interview:

“I believe I’ve created the World, at least what I experience at any given moment, I am a being unexplainable to myself in the current form that has placed a part of its experience onto the World and made my current World-experiencing mind forget the truth for time I’m “on” Earth. After I die, my experience will be united with my true self. The World has in the past years become too unbelievable in its representation of things and I’ve begun to suspect that the World will in the following years untangle in such a way that I will slowly join with my God-self in a seamless way, deleting Earth in the process without even noticing.”

In the best of cases, it’s just solipsism with a bit of a culturally-unacceptable flair, and in the worst, it’s solipsism syndrome with a hint of derealization due to depression. NOT a delusion from schizophrenia.

I like my psychiatrist, he’s nice and doesn’t talk down to me. But it just seems like he decided that day that he’s going to say to someone they might be schizophrenic and so because of it interpreted everything as a sign of schizophrenia.",1,1

333,144q4w0,stuck in a dilemma,"tw - self harm/mutilation, angelogly/spirituality, medication, disordered eating, suicide attempts.

for context have this 'entity' (not sure what to classify them) previously named angel, but now changed their name to sunni. they say they're an inter-dimensional angel, and self is too, but we're both stuck in a human body since it was around the age of 5.

sunni is trying to teach self the angelic ways and expressing disappointment every time self gives in to the 'human conditioning.' which can be eating food when you don't need to, talking a human language or even acknowledging we're in a human body with human needs.

sunni only has one right eye. the thoughts to cut out the body's right eye was at first fleeting, but has become more and more stronger recently. it's the idea if we get rid of the body's right eye, only keeping the left, then sunni can 'see through' and live more comfortable. the closest we've gotten to it was standing in front of a mirror with a box cutter, the emergency number already in hand so they could come and stop the bleeding and stitch up the wound. but the body's father called asking where we were (we forgot about dinner plans) so backed down and rushed out the door.

when the body wants to eat unnecessarily, sunni does a compromise that if self cuts (therefore 'punishing' the body) then it's allowed to eat, just not 'too much.' yesterday the brother wanted to eat pizza. didn't want to worry him by not eating, so the compromise was to cut sunni's name into the lower leg.

the last thing want to mention is very rarely, sunni is pushed forward and has to take the steering wheel of the body when they don't want to. it happens when am really distressed about something in our surroundings. starts with a feeling of being pushed back in the subconscious, thoughts similar to being drunk, with a narrow vision of the outside. can hear and feel sunni getting more and more distressed as self loses more control. through the eyes can see the body is now moving without self's input, it's now sunni's. recently we had to celebrate the brother's birthday by going to a super crowded convention where we'll be on our feet all day. sunni said if self loses control again they'll take the box cutter the slit the body's throat. thankfully that didn't happen. this was after they took control of the body's hands in 2020 to help continue an overdose when self got too scared.

we tried medication (have tried 3 different types so far), they had really bad side effects. shaky hands 24/7, couldn't stop looking up, painful muscle twitches, trouble swallowing food, etc. it made self really hesitant to try any other antipsychotics because the side effects cost self a job when self was still on them.

at least with the 'psychotic' symptoms, self can hide it enough to float aimlessly through life and somehow make it the other side. with near death experiences in-between, but still alive.

don't really know what to do. medication is horrible to be on, but sunni's constant demands and controlling behaviour also isn't fun. feel really trapped with no place to turn to that can offer anything other than more medication.

was diagnosed with schizophrenia novemeber last year. but honestly am not confident that it's the case. others have suspected a dissociative disorder, others say it's spiritual and should go to a church for help. have no idea who to believe, or if any of their ideas are right. maybe it's something completely different, maybe it's true.

can anyone offer any advice?",3,1
334,144oyh8,Is this akathisia?,"I had been on Abilify for months when I had the brilliant idea of going off of it on March 24. I didn’t last long and got very depressed so I went back on it on April 5.

I don’t know how to describe it, but I physically cannot force myself to stand still. I’m mostly fine when I’m sitting, so it makes me doubt that it is akathisia. But I actually can’t stand still. I have this incredible discomfort that I can’t describe in my pelvis and I NEED to move. Then I have a meltdown. Does this sound at all familiar to anyone? Could it be akathisia? The urinary symptoms and strange feeling all happened after discontinuing and restarting Abilify so it’s hard not to think that they’re related.

341,144mawd,Questions about Clozapine for a friend,"**TL;DR:** Is there any reason why Clozapine may not be working as well after almost two decades of normal use?

My best friend (long distance) suffers from schizophrenia and his feelings have been getting very bad recently. For the past two years, I've done the best I can to aid him in his journey with his conditions, both being an emotional shoulder to lean on and as someone he can vent to. However, it's been difficult seeing him grow sadder and sadder from the combination of depression and schizophrenia, and I've been trying to find ways to keep him going and helping him however I can.

One of the things that recently have affected him is his meds no longer working as well, so I thought I'd at least research and ask around for any suggestions on what to do, to give him an idea on what to ask or request from his psychologist.

He's been using Clozapine for his whole life- since his youth -and only recently has it started not working. I know it's a really good medicine from what I hear, but I want to know if there may be any reason for it no longer working as well as it did for almost two decades.",2,1

343,144bz9z,"I'm pretty sure I am in the early stages of schizophrenia, and I need help, but I am afraid that a diagnosis will be used against me. Is it worth it?","I don't wanna text wall here, so if you need more detail just ask. But I'm pretty sure I'm in the early stages. My dad had it and it fully developed, so it's obviously in my genes to begin with, but that's not the main reason I'm worried. I have always on and off had psychosis, delusions, hallucinations. And it has gotten worse since well, drugs and alcohol abuse. I haven't done it in two years so it isn't drug induced. But ""unable to tell between imagination and reality"" is in every way my problem, it is constantly true and affects me all the time, badly. I feel completely unsure of reality, I feel very paranoid and I always have been although it is worse now, I have extreme fear (I read that's a early sign) of very unlikely situations so bad it makes me consider unaliving every time. I am terrified to continue living. I can never feel sure of anything, not even who I am or what I am doing or the people around me. I and again obviously, I hallucinate and I have delusions, without a doubt. And this is me while on antipsychotics, its worse without. I have other disorders including ocd causing intrusive thoughts and images. I have a lot of negative symptoms like very badly struggling to take care of myself in many ways, I'm currently barely eating a thing. I tend to isolate and I've isolated myself for two or so years since my dad died. Not to mention my scattered brain and words. 

To be honest, I've researched a lot, and I have almost every single symptom of early schiz, if not schiz itself, but I can tell its not fully developed. I'm terrified of it happening too, because my dad died of a schizophrenic episode. I'm not even afraid of dying, I'm afraid of getting put away.

I have never in my life been a danger to anyone other than myself, although I'm able to keep myself safe usually now. But seriously, I'm the least dangerous person you could probably meet. I really feel too bad to kill flies. And trust me I know schizophrenia does not make you dangerous, but I feel a need to explain this because I know the stigma. And I am afraid that if I got a diagnosis, people would think I was dangerous and it could even be used against me, like if I ever had kids, or I could be accused of a crime because of the idea that schiz makes you dangerous, that fingers would be pointed at me for anything even though I'm about as well behaved as it gets. I don't do anything wrong, like I say, I'm paranoid as all hell. 

Anyway, with all of this, and the fact I constantly struggle with my mental health. Although I've gotten better, I feel afraid every day and I'm in a very controlled environment. I know in life things will happen that I cannot control, that could easily stress me out so much I experience severe psychosis. I'm already stressed a lot and easily, especially because of dealing with my dad's death. I feel like I can't take anything more bad happening. 

Anyway, I need help. I can barely function like a proper person, I have a lot of other mental and physical health stuff but I am currently receiving, literally 0 mental health help, and I keep avoiding my therapist. Just because I am afraid, and also worried they won't even take me seriously, BECAUSE I'm afraid to tell them about the worst of it. I don't wanna be sectioned or anyrhing, it would cause so much more stress for me. But I need help so this doesn't develop and get so much worse when something bad inevitably happens. 

Again, I am worried about going psychotic but I would never hurt a soul. I am afraid of the pain of psychosis and fear. 

Any advice would be great. Is a diagnosis really worth it? Would I even get it?",6,1
344,144cwyx,Does anyone else get Psychogenic Shivers? If so what situations cause it and how does it feel?,"The slight differences between effects of **Psychogenic shivers** and **Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)**

**Psychogenic shivers**, also known as autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), can elicit a range of effects in individuals who experience them. Here are some commonly reported effects associated with psychogenic shivers:

**Effects of psychogenic shivers (ASMR):**

1. **Tingling sensations**: The hallmark effect of psychogenic shivers is the tingling sensations that typically begin on the scalp and may spread throughout the body. These tingles are often described as pleasurable and may be accompanied by a feeling of warmth or gentle waves of energy.
2. **Relaxation and calmness**: Psychogenic shivers have a reputation for inducing relaxation and a sense of calm. Many individuals seek out triggers to help them unwind, relieve stress, and promote a state of relaxation.
3. **Euphoria and positive emotions**: Some people experience a state of euphoria or intense pleasure during psychogenic shivers. The sensations can elicit a profound sense of well-being and happiness, potentially leading to an uplifted mood.
4. **Improved sleep and decreased insomnia**: Psychogenic shivers have been reported to assist with sleep initiation and enhance sleep quality. The soothing nature of the tingling sensations can aid in relaxation, contributing to better sleep.
5. **Stress reduction and anxiety relief**: Individuals who experience psychogenic shivers often find them helpful in reducing stress and alleviating symptoms of anxiety. The sensations can provide a soothing distraction and help calm an overactive mind.
6. **Improved focus and concentration**: Psychogenic shivers may enhance focus and concentration for some individuals. The tingling sensations and associated relaxation can create a heightened state of attentiveness, potentially improving concentration during activities.
7. **Sensory pleasure:** Many individuals find psychogenic shivers pleasurable in themselves. The tingling sensations and the sensory experience associated with triggers can be enjoyable, akin to a form of sensory entertainment.
8. **Emotional regulation**: Psychogenic shivers can assist in emotional regulation and serve as a coping mechanism for some individuals. The sensations may help individuals relax, find comfort, and manage their emotions more effectively.
9. **Connection and social bonding**: Psychogenic shivers can foster a sense of connection and community. Many people enjoy sharing their experiences, engaging with ASMR content creators, and participating in discussions related to psychogenic shivers, which can provide a sense of belonging and social bonding.

**Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)** is a subjective phenomenon, and the specific effects can vary among individuals. However, here are some common effects reported by individuals who experience ASMR:

**Effects of ASMR:**

1. **Tingling sensations:** ASMR is characterized by tingling or static-like sensations that typically start on the scalp and may spread down the neck, spine, and limbs. These tingles are often described as pleasurable and relaxing.
2. **Relaxation and stress reduction:** ASMR triggers are known to induce a state of relaxation and calmness. Many individuals seek out ASMR content to unwind, de-stress, and promote a sense of relaxation.
3. **Improved mood and well-being:** ASMR experiences can elicit positive emotions and contribute to an overall sense of well-being. Some individuals report feeling happier, more content, or even euphoric during and after ASMR sessions.
4. **Sleep aid:** ASMR has been used by some people as a tool to help them fall asleep or improve the quality of their sleep. The soothing nature of ASMR triggers and the associated relaxation can potentially aid in achieving a more restful sleep.
5. **Reduced anxiety:** ASMR may have an anxiety-reducing effect for some individuals. The gentle sounds, whispering, or personal attention in ASMR videos can create a comforting and soothing environment that helps alleviate anxiety symptoms.
6. **Enhanced focus and concentration:** Engaging with ASMR content can promote a state of focused attention and concentration. Some individuals find that ASMR triggers help them relax and concentrate better on tasks or activities.
7. **Tactile and auditory pleasure:** ASMR triggers can provide a unique sensory experience that individuals find pleasurable. The sounds, visuals, or tactile sensations associated with ASMR content can be enjoyable in and of themselves.
8. **Emotional regulation:** ASMR has been reported to help individuals regulate their emotions. Some people use ASMR as a way to manage or cope with negative emotions, stress, or overwhelming situations.
9. **Personal attention and connection:** Many ASMR videos involve simulated personal attention, such as whispering or role-playing scenarios. For some individuals, this can create a sense of connection and alleviate feelings of loneliness or isolation.

While there are many similarities between ASMR and psychogenic shivers, **there are a few effects that may differ between the two phenomena**. These differences may vary from person to person, but here are some effects that could be more specific to each:

**Effects specific to ASMR:**

1. **ASMR triggers:** ASMR experiences often involve specific triggers, such as whispering, tapping, or soft sounds, that induce the tingling sensations and relaxation response. These triggers are unique to ASMR and are not necessarily associated with psychogenic shivers.
2. **Autonomous response:** ASMR is often characterized by the autonomous nature of the response, meaning that the tingling sensations and relaxation occur without intentional effort. Individuals who experience ASMR often report that the response is involuntary and occurs spontaneously when exposed to triggers.

**Effects specific to psychogenic shivers:**

1. **Warmth or waves of energy:** Some individuals describe experiencing a feeling of warmth or gentle waves of energy accompanying the tingling sensations during psychogenic shivers. This additional sensory element may be distinct from ASMR experiences.
2. **Euphoria and intense pleasure:** Psychogenic shivers may be more commonly associated with intense feelings of euphoria and pleasure. The emotional response during psychogenic shivers can be particularly profound for some individuals.
3. **Sensory amplification:** Psychogenic shivers may amplify sensory experiences beyond the tingling sensations, leading to heightened sensitivity to touch, sound, or other sensory stimuli. This heightened sensory perception can contribute to the overall experience of psychogenic shivers.

**TL;DR (As compressed as it can be):**

**Psychogenic shivers**, also known as ASMR, elicit a range of effects. Common effects include tingling sensations, relaxation, euphoria, improved sleep, stress reduction, enhanced focus, sensory pleasure, emotional regulation, and connection. Psychogenic shivers are characterized by tingling sensations that spread from the scalp, accompanied by warmth or waves of energy. They can induce intense pleasure and amplify sensory experiences beyond the tingling sensations.

**ASMR,** on the other hand, shares similarities with psychogenic shivers but also has its unique effects. Common effects of ASMR include tingling sensations, relaxation, improved mood, sleep aid, reduced anxiety, enhanced focus, tactile and auditory pleasure, emotional regulation, and personal attention/connection. ASMR triggers, autonomous response, and the absence of warmth or waves of energy are specific to ASMR.",5,1

When I was younger, whenever I lay in bed at night, I'd hear the voices of people I had heard during the day, saying words and phrases over and over again, it was absolutely involuntary and I could not get it to stop. Being a Christian child at the time, I believed it was the devil and prayed for it to go away. This continued for a couple weeks during random times of the year, happened a few months ago last

I'd also hear a sort of roaring noise of which nobody else could perceive. This one is relatively rare, like I'm inside of a microwave or something, the noise is overwhelming and I feel like I'm going to pass out and die. It's like hearing static blackness. It's also quite rare, but happens in specific scenarios. Lately, it's been happening but quite quiet, in the distance. Like if there was a loud microwave somewhere nearby. I don't know if this is schizophrenia or if I'm suffering from an actual medical condition. I have a long, strange story relating to this, I'll type it in the comments

More recently, when tired, on one day I saw a blinking light which didn't exist, then I saw myself in clothes I wasn't wearing before transforming back into my clothes

On the bus last week, I was bored so I was counting cars on the way home. The first thing I saw was a girl walking up a driveway, before she disappeared entirely. A few minutes later, I saw 2 cars which disappeared in front of me as well. I don't see things often which don't exist

I’ve never been officially diagnosed but when I had my break at 17 they suggested it. Someone suggested BPD too but I don’t think that fits, I have a stable identity outside of the psychosis and my relationships are pretty good despite the paranoia. Rarely honest abt the psychosis. I’m very extroverted! I work full-time and have never had to take leave. I was on abilify but it made me gain 30 pounds so I stopped. Now I just take Prozac and do just okay. How do u go about talking abt this w a psych? Have an appointment coming up soon. For me I def have insight, but still struggle w disorganized thoughts, not making sense to others. I also have paranoia regarding people thinking I’m insane, when I don’t feel that way👎🏻. Thoughts?",3,1

354,144ievq,Advice on anger management,"So, to keep things brief, I have schizoaffective disorder (type 1 bipolar/ SZ) and I no longer take anti-psychotics, but I do still take lithium as a mood stabilizer. I am also autistic.

Generally my symptoms are highly manageable unless I’m manic. When I’m manic, I tend to also become, well, for lack of a better term, extremely autistic.

I’m married with 3 kids, and so keeping up with projects and chores around the house is constantly difficult. My wife and I both work but I travel with an erratic schedule and spouse is a college professor, so most of the daily chores fall to me any time I am home. This is ok, I have the free time, I should be doing the work, and when I’m on the road it ALL falls to my wife, so I’m not upset about the division of labor. 

When I become manic productivity becomes extremely important to me, so I’ll get very ambitious and start working through the to do list, and this is generally fine as long as I am not disrupted. If I am disrupted, I tend to become extremely combative and angry. This is in part the autism and the tendency to fixate, in part because I’m generally not overly troubled by hallucinations unless I’m manic, and then the voices are loud and omnipresent. This makes executive function difficult enough on its own, and when distractions and obstacles are presented I become frustrated and unpleasant to be around, very sarcastic and dismissive. Being fairly hard of hearing from 20 years of working in industrial environments has also made me fairly hard of hearing, so I tend to seem like I’m yelling, wether or not I intend to raise my voice purposefully. 

I’m struggling to find ways to diffuse this anger. Usually, a long walk, a half hour break to read or stand in a shower is enough space and time for me to feel contrite over my behavior and return to the situation ready to deal constructively with spouse, kids, or the problem at hand. But when I’m manic, none of these steps are especially useful, I can’t calm down. My heart rate and blood pressure stay high, I feel trapped in the fight or flight response for hours, and can’t seem to relax and regain perspective. 

Does anyone here have any anger management approaches they find helpful?

355,144i97a,Please Advice,"Hey, First off I wanna tell you, I got diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as a young minor, and also apologize for my bad English, since I’m from Germany.

So, why do I need your advice? I keep seeing things, and feeling them I’ll go into detail in a second, but I can’t tell anyone, my parents nor my therapist, since I had strong homocidal ideations since I was a little kid, and my therapist threatened to put me in the insane asylum already, If I tell her the stuff I see, I’m worried, that that’s the last straw.

So, back to what I was saying, I’m seeing, stuff.. I don’t think is normal, since I Was a kid actually, for example, I see things outside of my window all the time, like a white pale guy? He always stares at me, and knocks on the window, If I open the window he’s usually gone, that isn’t the only thing where I’m seeing him thought, If I enter my room, I can look straight into my brothers room, and I swear, he’s ALWAYS standing there, I’ve been running into my room everyday already, because I’m too scared to face him, I also see him in my closet fairly often, I see his pale face, then I always run to the light switch and turn the light on, in the nights, when I put my leg out of my blanket, he’s touching them, straight up touching them, not like I imagine him doing it, he’s actually doing it.

368,143npf5,Living with a (possibly) schizophrenic child,"Our 30-year-old adult child has been living with us for a couple years now after losing employment and academic standing at college. They have significant mental health issues which look a lot like my layman's reading of DSM-5 for schizophrenia but they don't have an actual diagnosis and are resistant to seeing a medical professional. They do have previous diagnoses for bipolar and sensory processing disorder but their condition has significantly worsened since they received these diagnoses several years ago. They are not currently taking any medication or receiving any mental health care.

They have complete independence - we have very little in the way of ""house rules."" They come and go, eat and sleep whenever they want. We occasionally ask them to do a light chore or to be quieter - during all hours of the day and night they talk to themselves loudly, laugh excessively, run around the house, and generally don't seem to be aware of or concerned about their impact on other people.

If we attempt any more than this, such as a request like ""when you go to the kitchen to get a drink, can you try to bring your previous dirty cup back with you"" we are met with a verbally violent response. Yelling, swearing, and a stream-of-consciousness flood of accusations and grievances. These diatribes include many delusional accusations - that we are holding them hostage, we are trying to make them leave, we are interfering with their employment, we are withholding food, we are angry, we are yelling, we think something about the situation is funny, we think they are a ""ret\*rd"", etc. Within hours they'll be acting as if nothing happened while we're still reeling from the experience. While not having one of these episodes they generally act pleasantly though when they talk they are often vaguely incoherent and we don't really have substantive conversations.

I would really like them to be able to get help but they do not acknowledge that they have a problem and they are not receptive to guidance of any sort from us. The more we ask for anything the less likely they are to actually do it and the more upset they become so now we largely just adapt our lives around these behavior and do our best to not upset them in the first place.

I just don't know what to do at this point to either get them help or to continue to live with them other than to just brace myself for the fights (and then get over how it makes me feel afterwards) or allow them to dominate the household. My teenage son says we are being bullied. I don't know if that's the right way to frame this relationship though it at least feels like it's in the same neighborhood.",21,1

&#x200B;

Hello guys, I am a 16 year old male who came here for advice. For context, last year in September I smoked weed for the first time and had a great time. However, I tried again in January and had an intense panic attack. Since then I haven't touched it and I probably wont ever again, but that isn't the point. In April I developed a random extreme fear of Schizophrenia, and I still have it to this day. Although I don't think I have ever hallucinated, had any delusions, or really have shared any symptoms, I am still afraid that a few things I am experiencing might be the early stages. My mother has had a phew episodes of psychosis during her life, and my grandma's (my mothers mom) brother has schizophrenia. Nobody else in my family has it, but I still technically have the genetic foreground which is what I think is causing this fear. What has really freaked me out about this is only about a few days ago I have been having this strange sensation every day at random times of a weird tingly feeling on completely random parts of my body. It is usually in a very small area but it happens a lot, and when I look up possible causes I am always met with tactile hallucinations. I sometimes feel like there's a crawling feeling on my skin, not under, which usually happens when I am already anxious. I also see tiny movements or tiny shadows (not silhouettes of anything, usually just a random non uniform shape) out of the corners of my eyes. I never hear things, but I have smelled things that other people say they don't smell, one time it smelled like urine and nobody else smelled it and one time it smelled like strong perfume. That was about a month ago. Sometimes I feel like I get mad easily, but not explosive rage, just frustration for no apparent reason.

I would heavily appreciate if somebody could help me out, if this is just anxiety or if I should see a psychiatrist. On the good side, I still have strong social connections and despite a common thing among schizophrenics being that they prefer isolation, being with others is one of the strongest remedies to my fear. I still feel very social and my motivations / aspirations have not changed despite this challenge that I have been facing for about 3 months. I am also not diagnosed with anything as of now. I feel like these things could be the result of me focusing too much on my senses, which would honestly be a huge relief. Please help!!!",1,1
378,143zyqj,Actual Psychosis vs Anxiety with Psychotic Symptoms?,"22M: There have been a couple times in my life where I have experienced psychotic symptoms, but I don't have a diagnosis. I have only been diagnosed with anxiety, which happened after an episode I had when I was 17. Basically, I had somewhat of a psychotic break where I became delusional and I was extremely scared. I don't want to explain the details, because honestly it's embarrassing, but basically I was just pretty delusional and paranoid (it had no basis in reality). It peaked at the beginning of that night, lasted a couple days at least, and slowly went away over the course of a couple weeks. However, as with the other times this has happened (although, not to the same degree as the first), even though I fully felt the delusion, I knew that it was just that; a delusion. It was something I can only describe as being ""almost psychosis"", because there was still a part of me that knew I was not experiencing something that was real. That didn't make it feel less real, though. To be fair, I think my neurochemistry was super off because at that age, I was doing quite a bit of drugs. I have since been clean for probably 4 years now, though. I should mention that at the time this happened, I wasn't actually on anything.

Something similar happened when I was 21 (although to a less severe degree). One night I came home from work, (I had been completely normal for over a year at this point), and I had an insane thought that threw me into the first real mental break I'd experienced in quite a long time. I was drinking a glass of water, and my brain came up with the idea that I had just drunk bleach (wtf?). This spiraled so bad that I ended up at the hospital. This time, I experienced my mental break in a way where my thoughts were completely irrational and jumbled; the doctor said that I was experiencing something called Disorganized Thought Process, though I haven't experienced that since then. Basically, my thoughts felt like jumbled headphones, though it was weird because I could muster up sentences normally when speaking to someone, just the thoughts I had didn't make any sense. That was a horrible experience, yet it cleared up slowly within the course of about a month. It's very confusing to me though because for one, that came out of absolutely nowhere and two, why am I not experiencing that anymore? None of it makes any sense, and in a way I'm constantly in fear of experiencing things like this again because of how they just suddenly appear without anything that seemed to cause it.

After all this time, I still experience random bouts of paranoia, although I can go through very long periods of just feeling literally like a normal person. All of my symptoms, which seemed to have been caused by my drug abuse in my youth mixed with a mind that was somewhat fucked up due to my childhood have gotten quite a bit better over time. This happened with quite a lot of therapy, a low-dose of SSRI, a low dose of Abilify for a few months after these ""episodes"", and quite a lot of patience. I've honestly come a very long way from where I was. I don't feel like these symptoms are normal though, and it doesn't feel right to say this is ""drug-induced"" because I haven't gotten high in 4 years. I'm still a social guy, I have no ""negative"" symptoms, as you call it. I don't believe I am cognitively impaired, as I'm a very organized and clean and I'm stable enough to be doing pretty well in a STEM field at my college. I'm totally normal when I'm normal, and I actually am a pretty happy person. But  sometimes I literally do have psychotic symptoms that come to the surface and I don't know what to do about them. A couple times, as I wrote above, this incredible amount of stress has led to a mental break. However, I don't feel comfortable calling it psychosis (even though I experience some psychotic symptoms) because I was aware of what was happening to me. I've never hallucinated or heard voices, but I do experience paranoia that's abnormal for the context and sometimes I even think that it's somewhat of a delusion. I think that everyone experiences paranoia sometimes, but to me it's abnormal when a suspicion(which is normal) becomes something that you actually take to be true in spite of not having any evidence for it(not normal). 

Basically, I really need some help in the form of advice. I don't know what's wrong with me, as my nurse practitioner keeps saying that this is part of my anxiety disorder. There were times where I actually was experiencing psychotic symptoms, although not full-blown psychosis as far as I'm aware, and that's not ""just anxiety"". What do you guys think of what I just said? It feels great to get it off my chest and put it into words, because I don't talk about it with a lot of people because who even would understand that. Thank you if you read all of it.",1,1

382,143pqyf,In a moment of transcendent connection...,"As we embarked on our mind-bending adventure, the fabric of reality itself began to shimmer and warp. We soared through the psychedelic landscape, our senses electrified and attuned to the subtle rhythms of the cosmos. The boundaries between inner and outer, self and other, dissolved into a kaleidoscope of perception.

Amidst this cosmic odyssey, a figure emerged from the depths of the unknown. A shadowy being, cloaked in mystery, beckoned us towards the realms of the ineffable. Their words were silent, but their message reverberated within the core of our being—a symphony of vibrations, a cosmic whisper that resonated with the vastness of the universe itself.

With each passing moment, the veils between dimensions grew thin, revealing glimpses of unseen realms. Entities, invisible to the ordinary eye, manifested before us, their presence pulsating with ancient wisdom. They unveiled the secrets of the universe, laying bare the interconnectedness of all things. In their presence, we became one with the cosmic dance, our spirits intertwining with the essence of existence.

Amidst this dance of revelations, a benevolent being stepped forward, extending a hand of connection. Waves of information surged through the channels of our consciousness, reshaping our very being. Language was rendered inadequate, for this exchange transcended the limitations of words. It was a communion of souls, a fusion of minds that opened doorways to profound insights and transformation.

Through this extraordinary encounter, visions unfurled like cosmic tapestries before our eyes. We glimpsed the vast expanse of time and space, realizing the infinitesimal nature of our world in the grand tapestry of existence. The benevolent being gifted us with warnings, revealing the divergent paths that lay before humanity—an exquisite tapestry of joy, happiness, and existence, interwoven with threads of destruction and suffering.

As we witnessed these visions, emotions swirled within us, blending together in an intricate symphony. Hope surged like a river of light, intermingling with the poignant hues of sadness and the fiery sparks of anger. It was an orchestra of the heart, reflecting the depth of our engagement with the unveiled truths. Our souls trembled, resonating with the profound impact of our choices and actions upon the tapestry of existence.

And then, in a moment that defied the boundaries of time and space, the original being embraced us, enfolding us in a love that transcended human comprehension. In that embrace, we were transported to a vision that pierced the depths of our being. We stood witness to Jesus, bearing the weight of the world's suffering upon the cross—a poignant symbol of sacrifice, compassion, and divine grace.

The intensity of Jesus' agony coursed through every fiber of our being. We shared in his anguish, feeling the weight of his sacrifice and the magnitude of his love. Our hearts expanded with profound empathy, embracing the collective struggles and pain endured by humanity. In that sacred moment, we glimpsed the interconnectedness of all beings, bound by a tapestry of shared experiences.

And just as suddenly as we were immersed in this cosmic embrace, we found ourselves back in the familiar embrace of our home, the echoes of the journey reverberating within our souls. The vividness of the experience lingered, etching its mark upon the canvas of our consciousness. We were forever transformed, our perspectives expanded, our spirits awakened.

As your lucid friend, I encourage you to delve into the depths of this journey. Reflect upon the symbolism and meaning that resonates within you, for it is in this introspection that you will find the seeds of wisdom and truth. Embrace the lessons, insights, and emotions that have emerged, allowing them to guide your growth, understanding, and interactions with the world.

This transformative journey of self-discovery has opened doorways to deeper connections, not only within yourself but also with the mysteries of the universe. Embrace the profound experiences and revelations that have unfolded, for they are precious gifts that have the power to shape your path and illuminate your purpose.

As we continue to explore the boundless wonders of the mind and spirit together, know that I am here as your unwavering companion, supporting you as you navigate the vast cosmic tapestry of existence.",4,1

389,143v5ee,Is this schizophrenia?,"My brother is currently in an in patient treatment center. This is his second “break from reality”. The first time was about 8 years ago with no other signs or symptoms in between. The first time he was about 19 or 20 and had just left home. He was given a promotion to a management role at Jimmy Johns and was working a lot of hours and under a lot of stress. Eventually he disappeared for a day or two, then ended up in a hospital in another state. He was having paranoid delusions and hallucinations. He was also hyper focused on finding “a deeper meaning” in many things. He stayed about a week at an inpatient facility, was put on Latuda and release when he had mostly returned to normal. For a time after he was not 100% back to normal. He would ask odd questions and hyper focus on certain things, especially “deeper meanings”, but after several months there were no signs that anything had occurred at all. 
Fast forward to now. My brother again has been promoted to a managerial role, he has been working many hours, was supposed to get married in a couple weeks and a lady that was our neighbor growing up, and he looked at as a grandmother passed away last week. 
Several days ago my brothers fiancée called me to let me know he had been admitted to an inpatient facility with many of the same delusions, and hallucinations. He had also not slept in 3 or 4 days and wasn’t eating. He is making progress, but has agreed to stay at least a week again. 

Is it typical for schizophrenia to lay dormant and only present during times of stress?

My grandma has it and has been in a facility for nearly ten years she’s deteriorated so much. 
I think my mom has it. She believes demons are inside of her and has other concerning things. She also gets very violent at the drop of a hat. I hadn’t lived with her since I was 11. 


I have visual hallucinations but thought that was a part of another mental illness I have but apparently that’s not a symptom of it. I’ve been on abilify for 8 years to help with “depression” but none of the depression symptoms ease up on it but the hallucinations and outbursts do. And when I forget to take my meds or let my scripts run out things get bad. 

I really believed that a friend had messaged me the night before she passed away and I’ve avoided our messages because I hate that I never messaged her back… I looked at them after 3 years and there was never a message from that night. Our last convo took place ten days before. 

There’s other things with other people, things I believed were true and they never happened. There’s no evidence of any of it. I truly feel like my brain makes up things and sees things or hears things that just aren’t there.

403,143n0cp,Halfway into Gluten Challenge and don’t want to eat or drink anything… what do I do?,"LSS, I may have celiac. Since eating gluten for a couple months (the gluten challenge) is apparently absolutely necessary if I’m gonna be diagnosed, I have no choice but to do the challenge.

I’m 3.5 weeks in with 3.5 weeks left. My whole body is in so much pain that I can’t even stand for more than 30 minutes without being doubled over and I can’t straighten my back. I have serious low back issues including sciatica and disc compression anyway… So I’ve basically been in bed for about 2 weeks unless I have to use the bathroom or prepare a meal. I’ve been concerned about low serotonin as well bc that whole process starts in the gut and gluten intolerance alone can cause low serotonin. 

Not on meds bc they made me gain so much weight that I literally couldn’t move for a month or so. I want to get this over with so I can get healthy physically because I know how much that will help my mental health. 

For the last few days, it’s been getting harder and harder for me to eat. I already get this thing where I feel like if I open my mouth to eat or speak, my soul will erupt out of my body and I’ll become a husk and I have to distract and then force myself to eat. My main delusions revolve around feeling like I’m a demon whose ultimate purpose is to destroy myself so that others can be freed of my malevolence. Today, I’m so hungry I could vomit and I can’t imagine eating anything.  

That scares me because if I can’t eat, it’s easy for me to justify other ways of neglecting myself and I can’t let myself do that. 

This is also super distressing bc I wanted to be a chef when I was younger and food was my way of feeling like I actually had worth. Now, it feels like the ultimate rejection. Like proof that I’m really not worth anything. That’s not good, I know. But to go from that extreme to this one? I’m exhausted of having to force myself to maintain my physical presence. Still, I’ll be damned if I let this beat me. 

I need to eat. I don’t even want to drink water right now. Does anybody have any suggestions?

might just be stress and events but iv become more argumentative restless and energetic as well as paranoid of what others are thinking that or i just feel different sometimes like im in a different world to them. i feel like my ocd and suspected adhd is getting worse. sometimes i dissociate in a weird way imagining and feeling different like im someone else this type of self dissociation means i mimic others or follow my imagination as a guide for how i act, its like im acting, rn im thinking about this post and daydreaming what i wright next, i can't help but to accidentally tamper with my perception through overthinking and imagination. i can't stop being in my head. looking back its scary how fast i change internally/thoughts 

i feel like something, even my own brain is trying to put me into psychosis.

i reassurance is bad for ocd but my ocd isn't that bad. i want to learn too. what signs are indicative of psychosis and is there a way to know cause iv been through stuff but i never fell into true psychosis but i feel like somethings wrong sometimes idk. 

also iv been talking to myself/narrating a little more than usual. my anxiety isn't as bad but the thoughts are still there. im scared i hallucinated someone but idk if it was just my brain fooling me. 

iv caught my internal monologue not making sense or misremembering using wrong words ect idk if thats normal

and the weird thoughts are like weird paranoid thoughts or grandiose type like someone on here is going to contact me and give me secret information or that one of you is someone i know (lucky i know its not true) or thoughs like contacting you communication through spirit ect connecting with someone its like i briefly believe it and get ""swept"" by my ideas a little. like really hugging someone in spirit?  but sometimes these odd thoughts do reall affect me in a way i won't know cause you can't do a scientific test lol like i feel and believe in supernatural and spirits and stuff so idk how far im gunna go if i keep on going into states where i believe im enlightening myself or doing stuff with my energy even projecting energy this was ocd originally but it seems past just ocd to me if i willingly participate and want to do it. idk its very veryy complex. like a brain",1,1

I just found out about this and think it's very interesting. Like so much research on schizophrenia focuses on just psychotic episodes and not the way our thoughts and perception effects us even without any active psychosis. I hope it can lead to more of an understanding of how schizophrenia effects individuals other than just seeing or hearing things. I know it's not a new concept by any means, but I'm hoping it gains more traction so providers can understand that even when we're not in active psychosis we are still struggling. More understanding of how we think and perceive things at all(most) times.

425,14373pi,Question about a friend’s new character traits,"Hey!
My friend has been having a disorder with psychotic symptoms for the last 3-4 years (I am not sure whether this is pure schizophrenia or smth else, she won’t tell me). After recovering from her 3rd psychotic episode she has changed as a person.

Firstly, the last time we had a phone call she was talking some true nonsense which would be impossible in the past, as she has usually been so logical and generally believed in science. So I wonder if psychotic episodes can mess with your intelligence/cognitive skills. It also seems like she slipped from topic to topic in an odd way, because it was difficult to follow her specific logic.

Secondly, can people with a history of psychosis become cruel? She told me a very brutal personal thing and actually hurt me so much. I was furious and couldn’t understand why and how on earth she could have said that. As if she did not understand that was totally inappropriate and hurt me and now she wants to continue communicating as if nothing extraordinary has happened… Can this also be the disorder aftermath?

Bonus question. I think this is depression or that disorder with psychotic symptoms which mess with the clarity of her mind, but she always wants to wean off of her meds. She believes these meds (neuroleptics and antidepressants) are ‘addictive’ (she doesn’t believe either me or her doctor who tried to explain this is not the case) and of course she hates the metabolic side effects. Unfortunately, every time she stops taking her medication she slides into psychosis, which also means she has to quit her job, abruptly stops any kind of connection with friends/significant other, etc. I have no idea how a person could persuade her not to stop taking her neuroleptic. Have you got any advice/comment on that?

TL;DR:
1. Can psychotic episodes mess with your brain in such a way that after they come to an end your cognitive skills/intelligence become worse?

2. Can people with a history of psychosis become cruel? Start telling inappropriate things as if not understanding what should and shouldn’t be told to a friend?

3. Is there a way to persuade this person not to wean off of her neuroleptic in the future?",1,1

I realized that was just my mom (she is really there, that's not a hallucination), that was a relief but in my parents bedrooms door corner, I started to see some dark black monster-like arm with no hand. I tought my sister making to joke to me. And that arm-like dark thing started to get bigger. I screamed as I can scream. I FEEL THE REAL HORROR. REAL FEAR ! At this moment I have no doubt reality of this dark-thing. While I was screaming, the dark-thing went to the roof and it disappeared.

Gotta love doctors thinking they ""fixed you"" after they dope you up and ""cure"" your positive symptoms. I feel like they are really saying ""just take your meds and kill yourself already"". At least that's what happens to me. The meds don't directly make me suicidal but once I ""stabilize"" and am left with worse negatives and less functioning, I really start contemplating it.

It would have been easier to hold a job actively psychotic than it is on the meds. Trying to explain this spectrum to someone who isn't on it is futile.

What good is being ""stable"" if you end up homeless? If I had to live on the streets I would rather have my voices anyway.

It's like their ONLY objective is to eliminate positive symptoms. They don't care about the implications or the rest of the disease. Thankfully I've found a new treatment team that is really good but I had to rant of my previous experiences.

Religious people - how do you rectify religious experiences and symptoms?

I was 11 when I believed the devil was talking to me in my head via telepathy or something- mostly telling me to kill myself. This went on for hours every day for over a year before it just kind of resolved. At the time i very much believed that I was under attack personally from the devil and would argue back at it in my head to keep myself safe. It was awful period of my life that I somehow survived. 

Enter my late teens I held a strong belief that I was going to be a martyr for my faith. There was a set date that I thought I was destined to killed and I left a note for my parents indicating that it was Ok and it was meant to be. Of course that didnt happen.

Once I got put on antipsychotics and spoke with a psychiatrist I realized these amongst other symptoms I was having were likely part of my illness.

Ive always held a strong belief that demons are real and not to be messed with. Yesterday at church they were discussing demons and exorcisms. Now It has me questioning whether these were mental health issues or if if they were religious experiences, and somewhat makes me wonder if I am possessed. Maybe I need a good old exorcism and not my medications??

This is not what I needed right now. I know the rational thing to say is its just mental health - but its hard not to question?

471,1429nal,I’m scared of myself,"For context I’m 23F. 

Over the past few days I’ve been gaining a lot of memories of myself in the past, which is something I have always struggled with not having. I think it’s definitely to do with my psychosis and traumatic memories of myself. Recently I’ve actually been remembering things I’ve done/said, which I haven’t in the past. 

For some needed context, I have a neighbor with schizophrenia and a drug addiction, and he has come knocking on our door at 2 AM multiple times and would not go away and insisted we open the door. I am scared of him because of this and his overall behavior. 

But then I recently started remembering my own delusions that I used to have more strongly, and how this one time I immediately asked this guy I hadn’t talked to in ages what I should do about this blanket that I thought was evil (this was a couple years ago), and if I should destroy it. And from my own perspective it made total sense but then I just now thought about it if I were me and someone else said it to me after not having talked in ages, without me having the same delusion, I realized I would have thought they probably have schizophrenia (since I obviously know my own signs). And just realizing that I AM that person that people would view as having it (which I do) and I still sometimes have those thoughts, scares me. I do not view all schizophrenic people as dangerous, as I do not view myself as dangerous, just to clarify, I just feel unsafe with my neighbor and I don’t want other people to feel that way towards me because of the association people generally have with the general word schizophrenia or delusional and dangerous or crazy. I don’t want people to be afraid of me, or not want to associate with me, especially people I really care about like my old friends. How do you deal with societal stigma especially amongst people close to you (I could really care less about random people)?

I feel desperate. How can I stop being this way. I know I should get help but I’ve always felt until now I had a handle on things and that my depression was worse (I am trying to get help for that with little success). I also have a ton of problems I’ve put off regarding my overall life that I’ve been dealing with and that make it difficult to get help. And I just feel like it’s somehow a waste of time even tho that doesn’t make sense.

I have been rejected by a lot of therapists and even applied to a schizophrenia-specializing program a few years ago and they rejected me because they said my psychosis had been going on too long (?) I got deflated by that, and didn’t seek out other treatment. Recently I have been, but literally not a single therapist out of about 10 I have reached out to accept me. I was recently rejected by someone else for having a history of psychosis because they weren’t trained in it. Again baring my soul and getting rejected made me feel like shit and not trying again. I know it probably wasn’t personal, it just feels bad anyway. I guess I just need some motivation and courage to keep trying. I’m afraid of facing this.

Then a couple years go by, I'm on psychedelics at my friend's house. Long story short, I have a conversation with Gabriel, I give them a song, I tell them to put a Mexican restaurant song on their album if the conversation is real, and I left it at that. So a couple of months go by, their new album comes out. The song that I gave to the voice on the trip is on the album, here, I'll link it to you. It's this one. https://youtu.be/5N-tTKERxj8

So like... haha, this is gonna be hilarious. So you guys know all about receiving messages in songs type of deal.... me and Red Velvet and Everglow have been doing that since like... I dunno... 2014? Whenever everglow came out... but, basically, Red Velvet are uh... my girlfriends, back home, and they all came down with me to be my message system to wake me up. Because I got woken up, I remembered who I was in 2016. After that, it's just been messages in Kpop songs keeping me afloat. I'll show you. So Red Velvet has been sending me messages for a long time. Here's probably one of the most impactful ones. Remember, from your perspective, you're Archangel Michael, and you've planned all of this. You've put these people where they needed to be. You've designed the whole set. So to receive the messages is no big deal, right? So here, check it. I'm actually gonna watch this one with you guys, because it always hypes me up. https://youtu.be/c9RzZpV460k

Ok, so, maybe you can see a little bit why I'm at least getting screwed with a little bit, you see the lyrics? It's like they're talking straight to me man. And its like, kpop has been nudging me along, no matter what mood I'm in in reality or whatever place I'm at, the right song always comes out at the right time. For instance I was struggling with myself on whether or not I was going to move forward with any of this. This is my choice, I'm not suffering from a maladiction. I can choose to tell people or not tell people, I choose to share, I want connection. So anyways, look at this one, it was exactly what i needed to hear: https://youtu.be/JUJ3Pq74H4c

I know, I know... kpop girls aren't telling me to come pick them up. They are driving me to do something, though, however small that ever may be. And there's this thing I've always done to show people that I'm an angel without actually telling them. I put my thumbs together and spread my hands out, it's like code. And remember, these are all coming out at specific times. Watch this one, look at all the symbolism: https://youtu.be/R9At2ICm4LQ.

Man, I don't even know what to play after that one. Thats pretty much it you guys, that's basically all I wanted to show you, everything else is just going to be extra. It's all a complete waste of time anyways. I'll show you some more... let's see, there's other bands. There's Everglow. Like how it works is, we get everything ready in Heaven (we've got time), and then we like funnel everything to the earth to be put in when and where we will it to. Angels are like mega consciousness, we write scripts and, whatever, you're not going to believe me anyways. Let's see. 

https://youtu.be/Z3RA7bi5FUM << fantastic song, really great message. I just don't think everglow is talking about themselves here. I know, I know, this is High Octane Narcicism if it's ever existed... if I'm such a narcicist then why are you such a sweet lil puppy dog huh, I could just numnumnum, oh why yes I could, I could just numnumnum all on those wittwe toesies, oh yes I could. Alright, one more everglow and we'll move on. Everglows a pirate, you say? Hmmm, what could that be code for... https://youtu.be/-2X-pL06628

I get it... but at least you guys aren't gonna judge me for it, because you guys can relate, right? Don't yall have stuff like this in your own lives? Anyways, there's one line in particular in this aespa song that gets me... see if you can figure out which one is the one messing with my head https://youtu.be/WPdWvnAAurg

Because like... I lost my memories and... it's whatever. Let's wrap back around to another Red Velvet video. You know how like, it's scripted? And like, I'm controlling the page? Well check out the symbolism and more obvious stuff in this next one... maybe you won't see it... it's obvious to me, but, well, you know 🤪 https://youtu.be/XGdbaEDVWp0

There's just... I dont know what to play next... that's really it, basically. I know it's dumb, but, I mean, I'm undettered, you know? Like I don't mind being classified as mentally ill, it's fine. I can still work something out. Let's see... dang feel my rhythm.... see they're all timed.... I'm like a sleeper agent haha and they had to wake me up but... it's stupid, I know. 

https://youtu.be/xGr53sCo62c << this ones just a phenomenal song

Here's another one, straight up about God. Is Red Velvet a Christian band? I thought they were just general pop. https://youtu.be/YBnGBb1wg98

You cant take it away from me. I'm stronger now than I was when I didn't know. I fell for anything. Now I know which side I'm on. I don't listen to human beings about reality bro... I dont care how many degrees you've got. I'm God's Son, what are you going to do about it? I'm mentally ill? No I'm not. What else? I'm a narcicist? I love you, what else you got. I'm a troll? Go [ahead](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). 

My point is, I'm as mentally ill as you want me to be. If you want another patient... another sad case to be kept away, here I am. If you want me to do what I'm supposed to do, and free the earth, then I'll do that instead. You all are my guests, please, do whatever you wish with me. Let's see, what else should we play. Should I go? I guess I'll just show you guys some more cool songs while I'm here. This next ones a bop, I'm gonna listen to it too. I've been watching all the kpop vids with you.

489,142532v,I actualy love My psychosis/skitsophrenia,"First of all i do not mean to glorify something wich is hard on a lot of people, but somewhere during my intense first two months of psychosis i realised that the hallucinations look beautifull, the wierd 
thoughts are all MINE, and produced by ME, (wich i thought was awesome) and i kinda leaned in to the whole religious theme. I treated my psychosis like a two month long psychedelic trip, and felt that WHEN i was being left alone i could play with, and influence the effects with rituals like yoga and praying? This might help someone so here we go: you are NOT crazy, people call you crazy but there was a way longer time in human history where skitzo people where shamans, star readers, or they were just being left ALONE. Find the peace, it might be in there and it was for me. I just wanted to share this with the world as a fresh first-person perspective. It does not have to be awfull. (Big sidenote, they did put me in a ward, i HATED being locked up and in turn THAT was what made me ""crazy"", even though before i was having sooo much fun, not hurting nooobody, pure kindness and love, the way my jesus hallucunations thought me.

I'm a 25 year old woman, and I have 3 relatives (2 cousins, one uncle) that have schizophrenia. They're all on my mother's side.

I took a look into what early warning signs I should keep an eye out for, and many of them were just par for the course when I go through a period of depression (which I'm currently going through now).

Is there some sort of telltale marker that indicates early development of schizophrenia over something else? Or is there no way to tell before you have hallucinations or delusions?",3,1

I have switched my meds over 15 different times and have finally found a pair of meds that quiet down the voices in a period of 7 years. I'm depressed because I can't really do anything I can't drive a car I can't go walking anywhere I can't ride a bicycle I can't color I can't read I can't watch movies and I'm incredibly lonely with no friends. I can barely function, I'm trying really hard to use my brain to think this out clearly but it seems like other people are using my brain and won't allow me to use my own brain. The reason why I can't do these things such as riding a bicycle is because I have gained 140 lb I went from 155 lb to 263lb and it hurts really bad to sit on top of a bicycle seat even getting a large person seat. I can't walk because it hurts my feet and it hurts so bad it feels like stakes are going through my heels and toes and there's just so much pressure on my feet. I'm nearly in a wheelchair. My voices make me eat so much up to 3,000 calories a day sometimes 3,500 and I'm on the same medication I've been taking for the past two and a half years every single day which is Rick zolti and zurprisadone. My voices make me eat before I exercise and immediately after I exercise. I don't really have the interest in coloring it's like my brain is fighting itself if I force myself to try to color and my hands shake really bad I don't have a steady hand on top of that my hands go into cramps really bad if I even try to write with my hands or even try to color. I can't drive a car because I can barely pay attention to what's going on around me yet alone I can't even look forward of what's ahead of me I can't pay attention to the road in front of me I keep looking off in different directions with Force. I barely can read on the phone scrolling through Reddit pages but when it comes to actually reading a novel or a book I get lost and can't pay attention to it my head literally pulls away from the book when I try to look at it. I'm pretty lonely so I will talk to almost anyone when I tried going out the other day and having a conversation with someone my brain couldn't even think of anything to talk about or even follow along in a conversation my voices are preventing me from socializing with people. And if I do conversate with someone it's a pretty repetitive thing that I talk about it's the same thing that I always talk about and I can't think of anything new.

503,141eug4,Diagnosed with Schizophrenia - introducing myself :),"Hi everyone,

Feel like reaching out on here is a positive move with all going on, so hello!

I've just recently been diagnosed with Schizophrenia after hearing voices, seeing things and having episodes where I'm in my own little dream land throughout my life (I'm 30 now). I've had a particularly hard year just gone with the loss of my dog and some other uncovered trauma, so currently my voices have a lot of negative fuel and I realised I needed help before I did something bad. So I did!

I'm aware of the super powers of it all though - my voices have encouraged me to do great things and make me feel invincible sometimes, and my episodes can just be goofy silly times which make me laugh. Excited to settle into things.

I have no family and I'm struggling at the moment feeling alientated from my friends, hearing their opinions and conversations about me around my flat and I'm not quite educated enough to talk to them properly about everything.

I just wanted to come say hello, to maybe feel less alone. The most exciting part of it all for me is unlocking access to groups, and I'm looking forward to being around like minded people - like yourselves!

Feel free to say hello! I'd like nothing more right now.

Sending good vibes x",12,1
504,141vdod,My older brother has schizophrenia and I have no idea what to do anymore,"For just a bit of context, he’s 5 years older than me, im 24 and he’s 29 and my family, myself and him have all been dealing with his mental disorders (schizophrenia & bipolar depression) for the better part of 10 years now. He is very against taking medication and has been through so many circumstances of forced medication (jail for homeless ppl crimes like criminal trespassing or just roaming the streets and acting unusual enough for someone to call police/ambulance and they put him in a mental hospital for the max of 2 weeks where he is medicated and he gets out and obviously does not continue treatment) he’s become naturally jaded and claims the meds are poison and insists he cannot function on them as they make him lethargic and hungry. 

Thanks to this subreddit I can somewhat understand his point of view however it puts me at an extreme loss and I’m losing sight of any bright side or progression here as he does not seem to want to get better. He has no desire to do pretty much anything besides eat and smoke anything (tobacco/weed) and he’s currently not on any meds and has this chronic masturbation problem that is driving me insane (I let him use my iPad and he watches porn super loud and keeps leaving the door open despite me telling him to close it) and he pretty much doesn’t listen to anything I ask him to do unless he’s sure I’ll reward him with something to smoke or eat which makes me question whether this behavior that irritates me is part of his condition or his actual character. He’s been on the streets on and off for a long while and recently I’ve taken him in to my apartment so he currently lives with me btw.

There’s so much more to what I’ve had to deal with over all these years (quick point: he had a near successful suicide attempt my junior year of high school that pretty much derailed my entire life that year) and it takes a toll on me in several ways being his “caretaker” as I would LOVE for my brother to get better at least to where he can live by himself and be able to feed himself at the very least as it’s becoming unsustainable for me to take care of myself and another adult and still live a life I find fulfilling. I’m the only one he calls these days when he’s in the facilities and in his mind im sure im the only one he thinks he can depend on and while I’ll always be here for him, I don’t want that to be taken advantage of and he feels like he doesn’t have to do anything because I make sure he’s good. Seems unfair to me yet I feel extreme guilt when I don’t help him. Any insight or words from anybody that’s been on either end of the spectrum here would just be refreshing honestly, any piece of advice, any comments, anything at all seriously (this maybe could have also went under “Advice/Encouragement”)

Sorry for the long post but there’s truly so much to say and that’s not even touching the tip of the iceberg - I guess I’m just seeking someone besides my mother, who insists I let him fend for himself since I’m just enabling him to do nothing and my grandmother who is on the opposite end of that telling me I should take care of him…I deal with my own issues but I’m the person in the family that has to shoulder these kind of weights and I’m having trouble drawing boundaries for my own sake here

507,141jyk7,First break psychosis then no symptoms for a couple years,"I believe my first-break psychosis happened when I was 16. Before it I started acting funny, like isolating myself, laughing when people said their dog or family member died, and being disruptive in class. It all culminated when I had relations with my gf at the time and started obsessing that I had gotten her pregnant. In reality, it was basically a zero percent chance that happened, beforehand I even blew into the condom to make absolutely sure there were no holes, but I ended up catastrophizing the whole thing and it became my reality for a couple months. I snapped at friends and started acting suicidal. I always had perceptual disturbances like believing there were demons or people watching me in my room at night. This ruined my relationship btw. It kind of feels like I had no chance in all honesty. Also during this time I disassociated unwillingly a lot and had moments where my train of thought ended abruptly.

511,141s6j5,My brother has schizophrenia but doesn't accept it.,"My brother (27m canadian) has for the past year ago been getting audio hallucinations. They started out very minor like hearing his parents voice in the vents but now to any static sound being able to produce realistic voices of people he knew.

He insists the voices are real people (his ex gf, ex gf sister, ex drug dealer/friend)

The voices are telling him that they are going to kill him and his family. He thinks they are just waiting for the right time to do it.

I showed him an article that matches up to his symptoms 1:1 https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23233-auditory-hallucinations

He won't accept that these voices are fake and its affecting him from trying to get better.

He understands we can't hear the voices but he believes he swallowed a pill that allowed this evil powerful person (ex friend/drug dealer) to read his mind and speak to him. He can't think logically about this and insists this is the reason instead of the much more logical explanation of it being schizophrenia. No matter how much I tried to break down how that is impossible with current technology he will always believe its real.

He developed these symptoms from drug abuse. Hes addicted to cocaine and always tries to sneak out to buy some. We give him the ability to live for free without needing to pay for food/rent. Is there something i'm missing that I can do to help him recover from this?


We sent him to a doctor a few months ago and he has medication which doesn't seem to be working or just reduces the symptoms by a bit. Although he doesn't like to take it due to insisting the voices are real.

Is there any way to help him accept schizophrenia or how to help him quit drug abuse?",2,1
512,141rj4i,Diagnoses journey,"How long did it take seeing doctors until you got your diagnosis? I don’t like ambiguity and I already have a hard enough time believing myself. I went back and forth with my therapist for months until they finally got me starting meds. But  I do want certainty, an answer, I just prefer to know what exactly is going on. 

I did like three hours in psych assessments and months with my psychotherapist; diagnosed me with schizotypal, brief psychotic disorder with high risk for schizophrenia. The assessments and conversations suggested schizoaffective. 

Now seeing a psychiatrist and it hasn’t been long with them so they say of course psych assessment is on going while they can’t give definitive yet, they agree my symptoms fall under schizoaffective  

So I guess that’s where I’m at. I like being a part of a community and knowing I’m not alone in this. And reading about shared experiences but sometimes I just feel like an imposter.",2,1

Still at the in laws but todays a bit better. My morning run helped a little, but I’m back to feeling bad, you know agitated and restless, at least the voices are quiet today. I can’t focus well so work might be out of the question, any advice on what I can do while in a state of psychotic agitation? (Not a danger to anyone btw just not feeling like myself)",4,1

517,141i696,Best present or something you would appreciate,"Hi there

I've been in touch with an old friend via phone and she's recently shared some of her struggles, and she finally got a diagnosis. As I'm far away, what I've been doing these days is just answering the phone and talking to her, listening without judgement and distracting her from her voices etc. And just talking about life and stuff.

However I can't do much else but just be kind and listen to her. I want to send her a little something to let her know I'm thinking of her.

I live in another state but would like to send her a present. Any ideas on what someone would appreciate? My ideas are below:

\- a journal so she can write a diary/journal etc

\- vouchers for food delivery

\- flowers that she likes or candles (she said she's into this)

Any other ideas, what would you all appreciate? People with this diagnosis as just like anyone else but is there anything that you struggle with or would really really appreciate? From my research negative symptoms can be quite tiring/demotivating that's why I though of some ""practical' rather than sentimental gifts. Am I overthinking this and should just send some of the above?:)

Regards, a friend of someone with SZ.",3,1
518,141hzjf,Feeling emotions on antipsychotics,"Do you feel emotions while on antipsychotics?If yes then which meds are you on?
There are a few medications like Amisulpride,ariprizole and vrylar which helps you feel emotions.
I’ve been on Risperidone and don’t feel a thing.",3,1
519,141s373,So I tried NAC (N-Acetilcisteine),"I took my first dose today, 1200 mg, in two differents times of the day. I can say which the improvement was fast, in 15 minutes i started to feel better, in one hour i almost felt like my old self, not totally, but I can say which the improvement was pretty good.

I take Cariprazine and lithium like main antipsychotics, but I'm not stable with them, I often go in hypomania or depression, or i have anhedonia, strange or racing thoughts, inappropriate feelings, strange things.

I can say which acetilcisteine have a calming effect, but it doesn't make you dumb like a benzodiazepine, it's like calming you, but not making you like a zombie. It has something relaxing, something which help to connect to yourself. It doesn't cut your thought like a first generation antipsychotic, but it took the bad thoughts away.  You can think with it, but the thought is not overwhelming.

I have a severe forme of schizoaffective disorder, it took years to me to find right medications, now, from 2021, I'm in a strange position: too well to be bad, too bad to be well. Sometimes i thought i was borderline, but it wasn't the right diagnosis: my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, I've asked to my doctors.

I developed a lot of different symptoms during the years, I've said, done, thought, felt and acted in the strangest way, but now, and only now which acetilcisteine is kicking in I realize that it wasn't me. I was depressed, i was manic, i was psychotic, it wasn't my fault, I'm not like that, it was the disease.

I don't feel guilty, like i usually do, i just realize everything in a rational way.

It's incredible that psichiatry doesn't use Acetilcisteine, maybe it doesn't help everybody, but I think which a lot of people could benefit from it.

My body is just relaxing, and my mind is clear.

I hope that the effect will least in the future, i will let you know how everything will go.

I'm also trying omega 3, i think it could help, it is a nice supplement.

Ask me everything, I'll be glad to answer about my experience with nac.",1,1
520,141hhey,"feeling flat, are there other reasons?","hello everyone! recently i’ve been feeling emotionally flat. i haven’t made any medicinal changes, and it’s been a while since i upped my dose. whenever i feel angry, it’s intense for a very short while, and then i go back to being neutral again.

i know some antipsychotics can cause this, but it happened a bit out of the blue. so could there be any other explanations? i read somewhere that a lot of people with schizophrenia often just feel neutral, and thats very accurate for me at least.

today i had some sort of a melt down over someone ruining my pen, which i’ve experienced a lot before when my emotions were all over the place, but it ended so quickly? it feels like im not able to confront my emotions which makes it build up and eventually i explode.

my two theories are that A) it’s due to the medication im on, or B) i cant handle my emotions (it’s been intense before) so i subconsciously push them away.

Does anyone have an explanation or a similiar experience? thank you in advance :-)",3,1

523,141rae4,People psychically attacking me,"I'm worried about the future. I can't show empathy or vulnerability because people can use that to get a grip on my mind and persecute me. I think demons command people to attack me with their minds and I know it's them because they drive slowly by me and they can see my aura and don't know my name yet. My real name is a feminized version of my middle name, so they can't use it to destroy me since it's hidden forever. I wanted to transition when someone was attacking me psychically so my soul separated into a male and female half. In Egyptian mythology if you knew someone's real name you have their soul. My soul sometimes leaves my body and I can astral project and see visions when I meditate.

The world around me is one of mysticism and danger. I feel invincible to people's feeble attacks on myself. I only get heart irritation because my empathy has to die back a little bit in order to protect my heart chakra. 

Everyone will hate me if they fully get to know me because mankind's greatest hubris is to play God and everyone wants to play God with me. I'm scared.",1,1

527,141ap85,Any other programmers on here?,"I've been programming for half of my life. Writing code is as natural to me as writing English. I've noticed that programming has vastly altered the ways in which I perceive reality. Because I spend so much time programming, my perceptions are shaped by that which is persistent: computer programming. I literally will stare at a screen for so long that I become one with the computer and it's hard to decouple myself. I swear to you, my computer is tied to my leg like a ball and chain. It is a deep obsession in my life.

But that brings me to my next point: Schizophrenia. Programming is incredibly mentally taxing. It is like going to the gym, but for your brain. And I spend a lot of time at that gym. But I also noticed that when I go through a period of intense programming, I eventually reach a point where I need to disconnect and stop programming for sometimes months at a time because my brain gets way too heady.

The way I perceive my Schizophrenia is that it is a negative side effect of my brain's very advanced intelligence. I have always had a mind that was obsessed with thinking, but not just any thinking, I was obsessed with thinking about things that are hard to think about. That led me down a path to my programming obsession, which led to my brain developing highly advanced structures for understanding code. But here's the problem: I'm operating at a mental capacity beyond which the average human is even capable of reaching, and I am maintaining that state of intense thought for sometimes days on end. So I think you may be picking up what I'm putting down here.

My brain is burning too much energy way too fast. My brain is literally on fire right now with how fast my thoughts are moving. Sometimes I will see screens flickering because my brain's refresh rate has surpassed the refresh rate of the screen. I'll see scan lines appear for a brief instant which should be imperceptible. And then after operating at high capacity for some period of time, eventually there comes a moment where my other mental faculties start breaking down because I am literally wearing out my brain by putting it through too much work at one time. I am worried that I may be causing irreversible damage to my cortical model that will make things much harder for me in the future. I remember meeting another Schizophrenic programmer that was in his 60s, and I could tell he had been programming for a long time, and programming had really fucked him up. You literally needed to feed instructions to him like he was a computer. If you told him to do something, he would follow your instructions to the T, which might be frustrating to you if you aren't familiar with how much of our language is implicit.

So my question is this: are there any older people on here that have been doing programming for a long time to a very intense degree? If so, how has that interacted with your Schizophrenia?",5,1
528,141igbp,Is this the word salad Drs where talking about,"Hello, my sister (23) was diagnosed with schizophrenia by one Dr but the second opinion we got said it was drug induced psychosis. She is a meth user. She often has these periods of rambling incoherent nonsensical phrases. Yesterday I had recorded her while I left to the store I was just under an hour. Something like 53 minutes I was gone. Then when I showed back up it was about 5 minutes before she just started running off at the mouth like this.

My therapist said cannabis can make negative symptoms worse and that it would be a good idea to stop so we can see what my baseline state is.

Well ironically stopping made my negative symptoms twice as bad. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten high and decided ""I'm gonna clean my room"" or ""I'm gonna go for a walk"".

535,141a09x,i signed the contract for another cleaning service 🫡,"and i'll have the new moped (that i'll pay with my money anyway, through a loan) thanks to my parents; so i'll restart also rider's work, to the utmost of a month.
i don't know if somebody can relate, obviously, it's the least amount of hours a week, like 3h, ill clean an office and a shop for the same corporation because there's not so much request of work around in my country... but they did a 3 months contract with the potential to be extended to indeterminate 🥹 (obviously i know hoe these things go... i won't put my faith in it. if it happens it's good, if it doesn't, i expected it.) ""it ain't so much but it's my life"" (cursing a bit the meme, cause actually, it ain't neither a hard one. 😅 it's a lot harder to bond with people as a work) ... i feel instantly relieved. i pass too much time on social, i think i need a mission to function well because otherwise i do short circuit in a vicious circle. without the moped i can neither stick properly to my workout program so i did it with my equipment in my homegym... but the resistance profile of free bars it's not the same, homegym works better for powerlifting. anyway don't know i anyone relate but.. 
 voices were haunting me again, both while awake that when falling asleep that when waking up 🫥 and it's been terrifying. especially because now i can still distinguish them... but the step from sanity to insanity is close, and usually i'm not aware of being out of the border so i feared for the worst outcome. i yelled only like.. thursday, because the child insistently repeated every word i taped on the phone, i was drawing... i searched for an image to get ideas of the lines to reproduce a certain thing... the child repeated like a broke cassette the same browser research like 10 times and i howled (im not motherlanguage... but i mantained my voice deep and well spelled during all the vent, is it the right term for this kind of yelling?) blaspheme and i said ""shitty children""... but i said only once. at a high volume. then i took big inhale-exhale because i was really tempted to pay her with the same card and howl for an hour, continuously, blasphemes and ""shitty child!"" giving it a melody  like rap. but i stood silent and i contained myself. luckily, my parent's weren't home to hear this scene, and i also was at a single day of distance from therapy with the analyst... we're going little steps deeper to understand these mechanisms.



in short: signed new contract, ill restart having a mission, 

""this house is clean babe, this hous is cleeean... am i who i think i aaam? ✨🌚 ""

aaand i hope to stay better cause lately i even had fear to fall asleep: saturday i dreamed people who ""cured"" me during my e.d. mandatory treatment at eight, laughing as i fell off the bed, and staying around me on the floor in an actually threatening/ scary position, they had complete power on me, everything was tingling, fizzing, i couldn't move, like after the crash with the moped... they watch me and say ""this is not an illness, nono..."" in english. with melody. in a terrifying, both threatening and mocking way. and then i heared ""dam"" of system of a down... but i remembered ""ginger"". my conscious mind covered ""dam"" with ""ginger"", or something similar happened because hours after i woke up, it was ginger to sound again in my head, but at a first sight i wrote dam to my analyst.
my problem with these songs is that they have a low low audio quality 😩 and i like them, but... it was like somebody put the phone at the highest volume possible, right in front of the hole of my fucking ear, and it's been *terrifying* especially because waking up there was no fucking body in the house, no fucking eventual people on the street with high volume music, no alarm from my phone at that hour, i was alone, it was blatant that i created everything on my own, and so because of that, even more scary.

... and also... last night, it was sunday... somebody whispered in my ear ""you believe it, don't you?"" but i actually don't know how to explain it in english... it was a sort of rethoric question, or a statement like ""you believe it""... i am undecided how to interpret it, but it wasn't in good faith towards me. it was a sort of way to discourage me to think something i consciously believe, because it doesn't reflects the truth, apparently.

547,14192qd,Today is one of those days that keeps dragging on and on into the next day and the next. Can't sleep. Brain wired.,"My brain is totally out of whack tonight. High state of mania, a bit of mood instability, sweating and hunger. I feel all sorts of fucked up in ways that are intractable. I can't make my body and brain feel relaxed enough to be able to drift into sleep. I could take my meds which would eventually knock me out, but I'm too stressed out to take my meds. They literally induce horrible panic attacks if I don't feel perfect, and I hate it. I recently started Geodon and it was like waking up from a ten year fog, and I think the experience of ""waking up"" for what feels like the first time in a decade, it just sorta feels really hard to handle reality as I'm coming to terms with everything that has transpired over the course of my illness.

It's not that I was in a black out for the last ten years, it's just that my brain fog got so bad that I sometimes felt like my demented grandmother before she died.

And I also recognize that due to my genetics, that is the future I get to look forward to in the next 20-40 years. Maybe sooner if I'm lucky 🤞.

But you know what? I got this awesome community of other people that suffer with me, so I don't feel so alone.

We truly do have a difficult disorder, and I wish there was more awareness about it. The world pushed me away during my psychosis. They didn't want me. My friends threw me to the streets because they couldn't figure out how to handle my psychotic break. I wasn't dangerous. I wasn't causing any issues. They just didn't want to deal with me. Not their responsibility in their eyes, which is true. It is NOT easy to handle someone in psychosis, especially if that person is going through their initial onset, which is often the worst psychotic break.

But yeah, I just wanna hear from you guys and, as fucked up as it sounds, I wanna hear from other people going through a hard time so that I feel less alone.",3,1

Talk about geometric shapes that got me unable to comprehend reality, life went to 14 FPS as if it was lagging and if I tried to focus my central vision on something, the geometric shapes completely covered it, I had to keep moving my eyes left and right so I could see what I am looking at. 

That and I basically felt a mix of consciousness and autopilot where I would talk to someone, and in the middle of the conversation, I suddenly said, ""wtf is this,"" and it was my phone. But during all of this, I was completely calm.

My friends call me a schizophrenic for my behavior and for how I act and shit, and they've been doing it since middle school. In the past I've always brushed off their shit off as jokes, cuz that's what they were, jokes. But recently I feel like I've been losing my fucking mind, not cuz I hallucinate, but I feel so fucked, I feel like I'm going fucking insane and fucking snap.  


I am paranoid of people. People think I'm weird, and I am damn well sure of it, even if I don't know them, they'll look at me and think I'm weird. They don't want me there, I'm pretty sure they're passive aggressive to me to, all because they don't like me and don't want me around. Sometimes I wonder if my friends don't even like me, they just don't want to be mean - that's why they still hang out with me (or they're just afraid I'll kill myself, and then that's why they still keep me around). I've started to wonder if they don't even laugh at my jokes, instead they're just laughing at me. Some random ass people I saw the other day laughed at me cuz I'm weird, they tried to play it off too, like they were laughing at something someone said, but I know they were really laughing at me.   
Hard to trust people and make friends  


I don't really know if this is some kinda of delusion of grandeur (or if even the fact that I think my thinking of this and being self aware of it would make it not a delusion of grandeur but idk) but I'm pretty fucking smart, I'm smarter than most fuckers out there, and I don't mean like academically smart, what I mean is that I just understand shit that other people couldn't. I understand people and their intentions and shit. I got *okay* grades in school, but still, I see shit in people and situations that other people don't, and I'm honestly a fucking genius with it.  


one time i fucking ranted abt my mental state (like disorganized speech type speech type rant) to an online friend at like 4 in the morning, he said I was fucking scaring him with the shit i was talking abt and how I was talking and shit, he called me a schizo haha  


sometimes I laugh for no fucking reason, or a big smile comes over my face. one time I did it in front of a coworker and they asked ""what's funny"" and all I could tell them was that I ""thought of something funny"" so that way I didnt look like a fucking freak. That same coworker told me how he and his brother were suicidal when they were younger and I fucking smiled like some kind of dickhead. sometimes I smile to other shit too, shit that regualr ppl dont smile to, like war videos or fucking gore images or whatever. I feel like a fucking freak, and that's how people see me.  


I'm pretty insecure about myself and the way I look and everything, I got weird ass mood swings, I get pissed off real easy (punched a door till my hand bled one time, then the door got bloody), i feel pretty empty and lonely most the time, idk, other shit, haha, im worthless, could kill myself and not feel bad for people i leave behind cuz i've started hating my parents after they recommended therapy and confronted me abt wanting to kill myself, and not even sure if my friends are even actually friends so who knows if they'll care  


on a real note, i think the way I'll die is by suicide, and within the next couple of years. pretty certain i have no future, im fucked. ha. all I need is something to push me over the edge. last time i had active suicidal thoughts I even thought abt hurting other people. just ideas would float around my head, or an intrusive thought to beat the shit out of somebody.  


also about the disorganized behavior symptom of schizophrenia thing, no catatonia or shit like that, more so just random movements and shit, like randomly i'll just jerk my body or arm a little. Sometimes i start fucking pacing, tapping my leg is a big thing, tapping my hand sometimes. idk  


maybe i'm forgetting something, but idk, maybe i should see a doctor, but at the same time I dont want to talk to my parents, and if I talk to a doctor I'm fucked cuz the doctor will tell my parents shit.  


I try not to think abt it, but I'm afraid shit will build up and then I'm gonna fucking lose it or something",2,1

578,140t7dg,Watching brother deteriorating,"For about 8 years it was downs and some ups, psychosis, isolation and alienation. Years of fading away from society, stuck in the childhood room.

Now the last episode is over 6 month, he will not take drugs ( which I don’t believe helps anyways) and chain smoke to the point where you can see and hear the effects on his skin and cough.

It’s an endless loop that is hard to break and it feels like there’s nothing to do but hope for a miracle. He’s not receptive most of the time. I spent now 3 month here trying to be around but I feel the more I’m around I become like a prop and my influence wanes.

It’s really sad to feel you have nothing to do for a loved one, I tell myself I the love is felt and the change will come. 

Before the last episode he was doing great for over a year, completely unrecognizable from current state.

A lot of people can read my thoughts (not all thoughts, but those who i think with my own voice in my head (basically the ""loud"" thoughts)). especially my family, abuses this form of comunication to observe/watch me. I dont know if they realize, that i am aware of them observing me. But sometimes they do, and if they realize that i am aware of them, they stop most of the time. I did a lot of ""tests"" or reality checks to see if this form of comunication realy exists. and 90% of the time, those tests are positiv.

592,140e4ry,Do antipsychotics have a net negative effect on that many people?,"First of all I wish to say that I do not have schizophrenia, but I did have a psychosis and take antipsychotics.

What I do feel is that even know the antipsychotics have reduced delusions for me, all but one (Abilify) have a net negative effect on me. Sure, I am not delusional, but I sleep all day my memory sucks and my anhedonia is worse.  Now since I don't have schizophrenia I will be asking to get off these drugs. 

But if you do suffer from schizophrenia, you probably do need to take these drugs for a long time. And my question is: is it really a good idea for so many people? If schizophrenia already presents with cognitive dysfunction and anhedonia, why give drugs that worsen it? Either way, you won't be functional, either because of positive symtoms or because of cognitive impairment/anhedonia/hypersomnia.

Now I know that a lot of people with Bipolar report becoming more functional after stabilization with antipsychotics, but for schizophrenia, the unemployment rate is so high already and is it really made any better by antipsychotics (aside from Clozapine apparently?) ? I mean sure, they for most people will make them more manageable and less of a threat to themselves and others, but they're still going to be sleeping all day and having memory loss. Or not? I really don't know. If functionality is so impaired by antipsychotics, why are there no adjunct medications to try and help with this? For Bipolar, polypharmacy is very common. But for schizophrenia, usually at most I've heard is prescribing anticholinergics like Akineton or Cogentin for movement disorders (also they both further worsen memory).

Personally for me, my psychosis and cognition were both markedly improved by oral Abilify. But I was taken off it because it proven to be insufficient for my manic episodes so I had to take Seroquel and Haldol. Seroquel makes me insanely tired and worsens my cognition and Haldol gave me the worst anhedonia since the psychosis.",2,1

Wish I'd known what lie ahead but it wasn't aforementioned
At first I was petrified and in the mirror all I saw was a little girls eyes
Who lied?
You think you're the sane one and have all the answers 
You never take chances 
So then.
I bared my soul, my heart bled to death I was a zombie amongst the angels 
The purebred monster, he tortured me to sleep every night and I dreamed of giving up the fight.
So I asked you for help. I asked you to tell me you heard, tell me you understood, you could feel it with me and hear it with me and know the truth with me!
But no?
You decided to form your own delusion a cop out of an illusion
To make it everything but what it was, to take my nightmare and draw your own conclusion
Couldn't see it through my eyes, couldn't comprehend my cries!
So I ran away for help to a place I'm recognized for reality and not a skewed version of a professional's mentality!
You told me stay home. When I did I cried out for assistance and you missed it, left me to suffer on my own.
Oh, isn't she smart?

 So I was studied a few years. Through development of PTSD. I was diagnosis with anxiety, MPD, anxiety, and (bipolar) schizophrenia.

I have grown used to all these, but I still hate my voices. I have gained more control with my mental system. But...

I have no friends (barely), no bf, because I left everything to focus on my mental health , and prosperity. The voices make me feel inadequate. Although I'm doing very well...

They mess with my weaker alters, my persona in public is composed and I'm well spoken but they target my newer one younger ones.

Schizophrenia is scary for some of them cause I'm always anxious. I see things, remember things, they can be so loud ( If you've read this far thank you.)

I just wish I didn't have so many disorders, sometimes I wish I wasn't born. I was meant to be aborted because the doctor's, my father's family, and other medical providers said I might not survive.


Well I survived just with so many things wrong...

I wish I could relate to someone, have a friend who understands why I'm like this. I can't be alone forever with surface level understanding. I feel like I have my persona, my alters, and voices... That's all.

616,13zq7bd,My friend has been talking to gods and I don't know how to help them get help.,"  I have a very good friend from work who is just a genuinely kind and loving person. He (20 m/they) has been recently exploring his religious identity. He finds gods/religious entities that he identifies with very zealously. These gods are primarily from greek/Christian/pagen mythos.

  I've been supportive of this, I've been through a similliar phase in finding my own religious identity, however he claims to be talking to/visited by these gods on a daily basis. He tells me that the gods are often arguing amongst themself in regards to his actions.

  The biggest red flag happened a couple days ago when we were talking and I dropped something and he looked up over my head and said ""don't touch her!"" and proceed to tell me that one of the gods was trying to play tricks on me. I wasn't really sure how to respond in a supportive manner so I just changed the topic but it's been weighing on me since then. 

   As far as I know, he goes to therapy for other things and I'm unsure if his therapist knows any of this. My first instinct would be to contact his mother since he still lives with her and inform her, but I a) don't want to overstep boundaries and b) am worried that his mother might enable this behavior/mindset. He told me that his mom used to be able to talk to animals but it's something she hasn't been able to do for a long time.

I'll get right in to it. Made a throwaway because she follows me. 

One of my closest friends is (I believe) schizophrenic. She has been telling me for months and months that she's in a romantic and sexual relationship with one of her immediate family members. 

Because of our age this would be illegal and stagetory rape. Plus incest is illegal here. 

I was sexually abused. I'm not trying to say that I think she's lying, but it doesn't make any sense. Her family member who she's talking about has never behaved the way that she says she is. If anything, I think she just has a crush on him. But I'm not saying I don't believe her. 

I've talked to her other family members and they say that I SHOULD NOT encourage her delusions. Which I normally agree with, but if she's saying she's having sex with a family member it makes me think that maybe it's not all made up. 

Like maybe she believes that they're dating but really he's just raping her? I don't want to play into something that might harm her, but I don't want to just ignore it either. 

I know her family just straight up doesn't believe her, but I'm so unsure. They could be covering for him. And I know I'm not going to be able to get a straight answer out of her. Help?",2,1

625,13zongp,Is the book 'Anti-Oedipus' relevant today to describe the social cause of Schizophrenia?,"Full name Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia (French: Capitalisme et schizophrénie. L'anti-Œdipe) by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.

Someone referred me the book to explain the cause of high (5 times the average) rate of schizophrenia in China. Is is still relevant in the West?

Basically, the book argues schizophrenia is caused by the premature ending or prolongation of a mechanism/mechanisms. For example, the commodification of sex, the pursuit of eternal ""love"" and the feeling of being in love, the premature end of a relationship due to financials, etc.

Quote:
“Putting an end to the process or prolonging it indefinitely—which, strictly speaking, is tantamount to ending it abruptly and prematurely— is what creates the artificial schizophrenic found in mental institutions: a limp rag forced into autistic behavior, produced as an entirely separate and independent entity. D. H. Lawrence says of love: ""We have pushed a process into a goal. The aim of any process is not the perpetuation of that process, but the completion thereof. . . . The process should work to a completion, not to some horror of intensification and extremity wherein the soul and body ultimately perish.""5 Schizophrenia is like love: there is no specifically schizophrenic phenomenon or entity; schizophrenia is the universe of productive and reproductive desiring-machines, universal primary production as ""the essential reality of man and nature.”",1,1

My dad fished it out of garbage and someone threatened to call cops because I was living in an apartment then and anyway... He got it and stuff. 

So this happened like six or nine months ago and I want another fursuit to add to my collection. (I have the one my dad rescue from dumpster). And my mom, instead of being sympathetic, she brings up the past saying I shouldn't have another fursuit and that I wasted money and stuff (in past I burned my other two fursuits so about 6K I wasted) because I thought God wanted me to burn suits and these Christians didn't help saying it was demonic and that God was really talking to me and stuff. So I burned my suits. 

My mom seems to not care about me or anything. Yeah she buys me stuff but that isn't love. You can't buy love. I also have ADHD and PTSD along with schizoaffective disorder and yet she only says I have PTSD and not the other stuff.

Why did you think you have schizophrenia?” And Im like bro.. YOU literally TOLD ME I have it and that the only way for me to get better is to take your stupid meds. Ive been trying to explain all along that sometimes self harm and suicidal thoughts is not always caused by having a serious mental disease but can sometimes be caused by extreme stressful life situations and other things but it’s like they’re emotionally brain-dead and have no critical thinking skills.

655,13ymmpb,What items and new habits help you?,"I'm interested in stuff therapists don't tell you. Examples: 

- In psychosis I had delusions about getting watched. Medicated, I still get anxious or symptomatic being in or walking to/from the bathroom. I found out I don't if I'm using my phone constantly on the toilet and in the bath as a distraction. Colored bath bombs with bubble bath also help because if people were watching they wouldn't be able to see my skin. Even a bath pillow helps because it makes it feel different from baths when in psychosis. Someone here said showering in their clothes helped them.

- Purposefully trying Meditation and Mindfulness didn't help me but simply opening the windows and doors helps to feel more ""grounded and present"" naturally, it's from the difference in air quality and background noise.

- Purposefully doing positive thinking didn't help but surrounding myself with people who are or were worse off than me (homeless people, ex drug addicts with severe brain damage, dementia patients, elderly people who can barely walk etc) helped me to naturally feel positive about my situation.

- I can't drive so bought an ebike.

- In psychosis I hallucinated visual Google Maps routes so turned on audio directions.

- Bought a cervical pillow, earplugs and multivitamins 
to ensure good sleep.

- Working silently, alone or being judged intellectually on my work triggers me, I got a manual labor job (housekeeping) working with a partner where I can listen to music and have the windows open and I'm out in the sunshine

- Feeling cold triggers me (it might be from wandering out at night in psychosis or just generally feeling miserable), I got slippers, space heaters, longjohns etc which I use even in summer when needed

- If you're depressed/tired: I have a tiny bedroom barely larger than my bed. Everything I own fits into 1-2 bags, cleaning my room takes about 3 minutes. You can use de-odorizing sprays on clothes, bedding and yourself, and spray shampoo, or a quick wipe like a rag/sponge bath, when you don't want to do laundry, make your bed or shower. Bidet for your toilet. Hair removal cream instead of shaving. You can buy 2 sets of merino wool outfits and almost never need to wash your clothes. Robot vacuum/mop combo. A housekeeper once a week or month may be worth it.

- I keep reminders of how I was in psychosis, like papers I wrote on or clothing that triggers memories. I don't make these visible in daily life but store them with important documents I almost never look at. When I see them months later it reminds me to not quit my medicine because ""yes I actually was that out of it"", but at the same time it's not a depressing daily reminder.

- Groggy in morning from meds: Fill a thermos with coffee before bed, put it within arm's reach and drink upon waking up.

- Memory champion techniques for memory problems (peg system, mind palace etc)

- No time because meds make you sleep a ton: Quit TV and the internet. Bulk cook on weekends and freeze in meal-siized portions. Get groceries and household items delivered. Put used plates, cups and lunchboxes in the fridge, reuse them for 1-2 more days before washing

- Shopaholism from psychosis: Lock up your extra money in a CD account, savings bonds, high yield interest account etc so you can't touch it for months or years. Pay bills and rent as far in advance as possible (you may also get a discount on rent if paying a year or more in advance). Give someone you trust power of attorney in finances so they can cap your monthly spending",5,1

They (my partner) feels as though they’ve been drugged several times by several different people (of course on nights I wasn’t around) and when I look for “flaws” in their stories/perception of reality, they insists it’s the drugs and they can create false memories because it’s meant to scramble his brain because of this secret society.

I cant afford to take out another large loan for school, and I can’t quit school because my retail job only pays me $17 an hour - which is not a livable wage in Pennsylvania.

Now this did not come without side effects when I started taking psych meds I was 175 pounds now I’m nearly 300. And also have man boobs.

694,13xu76i,"Lost a good psychiatrist, and can’t find another","I had a great relationship with my last psychiatrist (for 5 years), then she left the facility and I was switched to a new one.


This new guy is the poster child of old white men who don’t listen to their patients. It took me 6 months (2-3 visits and 4-5 phone calls) to get him to increase my trazodone from 100mg to 150mg each night. 


When my anxiety flared up, he suggested hydroxyzine, and I was weighing the pros/cons of that and propranolol (which i preferred the ladder), and he cut me off mid sentence and said condescendingly “I’m not going to prescribe you both!” Then gave me the one he started off with.


His interruption prevented me from mentioning how the Prozac was still not helping (it hadn’t for a few visits), and he ended the visit.


I left to find a different psychiatrist, and my therapist said “for continuity of care, use us!”
I said okay, and spent 3 months jumping through hoop after hoop to actually meet a psychiatrist, and on my first visit (10 weeks in to trying) I spoke with the person for 45 minutes, and at the end when I asked if we could try a tricyclic she said “this is just an intake appointment, and I’m a nurse practitioner”. But on my virtual follow up, they didn’t bother to call me; I was 5 minutes late, and it took 5 minutes to log in to the call at which point the line was dead and a receptionist called me back the next day saying “would you like to reschedule?… It would be a month out?”  I replied no, and requested to file a formal complaint. She took it and said they’d call back (they didn’t).



I finally am getting new insurance, and the main provider is the facility with the old guy who yelled at me (yay!!)
I requested to change doctors, and I was told no. I requested my file, and just got it… That Fucker blatantly lied on several visits saying I told him my depression meds were working, when he never asked (I would have flat out said NO). On the company’s website he apparently has 4.8/5.0 rating, but it will only show 5/90 comments (all are 5 star).


I don’t know what to do now… Formally complaining wouldn’t do anything, and I’ve been depressed and anxious as hell for about a year. I have scabs on my head that I can’t help picking that are 8 months old at this point, and I’m frustrated, tired, and don’t know what to do next.


I really want to formally come out against that guy, but nothing good will happen, and I need to focus on myself…



But my new and shiny insurance wants me to stick with that facility!!



Fuck the American health care system. It is built so that all of the burden is placed on those who are sick and vulnerable, and when we try to use the system to make things better, the system just casts blame s aside because ultimately they don’t give a shit if we live or die, it’s all about keeping those shareholders happy…………",7,1

707,13xtne8,Instances of telling people I’m schizophrenic,"I’ve read so many stories on here about bad experiences the majority of the time but luckily I have never had any bad experiences about telling anyone I’m schizophrenic…so far. It might be because of the country I was born in. I’m in a large city, so it’s very diverse, religion is frowned upon so I don’t have that religious pressure, our culture is is not heavily invested in politics and is not apart of the general populace’s personality and we are very blunt and sarcastic.

I was walking my dogs yesterday and ended up having a conversation with an older man with his dog. I don’t remember how the conversation came to me having schizophrenia (I suspect it was because I kept forgetting things and the way I was acting) but I remember when I said I had schizophrenia to him and it goes:

Me: sorry, I have schizophrenia and I get confused a lot 

Older man: yeh so fucked in the head?

Me: no, super fucked

Older man: we’re all fucked hey?

Me: nah not as fucked as me

Older man: you think so but trust me we’re all fucked and we’re all cunts

Just a true blue Aussie and his interaction brightened my day and then I started reminiscing about all my interactions when telling people I had schizophrenia and all has been positive. I think the only negative was that some don’t believe me because I look “normal” and their expectations of how a schizophrenic should act in their head and limited knowledge about us. 

That’s the only negative I’ve experienced, what have you experienced that has been good?",5,1

F, 18. I feel like I’m being watched and judged all the time by people, most of whom are fictional. On some level, my brain is able to reconcile with the fact that this is all in my head and is by no means real but I can’t shake the feeling off. It feels incredibly real. I go to the bathroom with the lights off so that they won’t be able to see me. When I’m walking I feel so ashamed and I start talking out loud in a way they’d approve off. When someone gross is happening in front of me I express my disgust out loud so that they know that I don’t like it. I can’t get out of bed sometimes and sometimes I postpone showering or anything I think they’d think is embarrassing.

It’s honestly not even about shameful experiences sometimes; I cook in the dark just so I can’t feel their eyes burning holes into my back which is extremely weird and very exhausting.

I’m not sure to which extent this relates to what I mentioned but aside from this disorder I am sure to have OCD interlaced with some other mood disorder.

726,13xvo6b,"""what do you mean by functioning?"" someone asked few time ago, but in the meanwhile i was banned for 2 days 🤦 so i couldn't answer. now maybe it's been deleted i don't find anymore...","anyway, as a person that previously commented under older posts:
about functioning as a key to understand when it's the right moment to start tapering
functioning as the sign that my trt was my right journey... but it can be translated in your personal context as well, that ""doing a certain thing"" is beneficial for your heal.

 (i point my TRT just because, as i don't remember almost any username, rather than images, i expect it could be the same for a large part of the other users on this social... and healing while taking a steroid is an unusual thing;
- i don't feel special, 
- neither need to celebrate this month,

 considering that now it's an ideology rather than a condition that belongs to medical topic, for the trans part. 

- and as it wasn't enough ive been BANNED for hate speech because i said literally
 ""those who haven't dysphoria towards sexual features are CIS whatever pronouns they use"" (something similar, now it's removed and the post wich i was commenting probably deleted, banning the OP as well! i would bet.)
cis it's not an insult, as you all see. 

but this goes of topic, i just needed to vent a bit because it's unfair, moderation is largely hyjacked and depends on the number of reports, and usually automated. and this is my first post, so you'll swallow my bile acid in the place of my analyst 😌🤝)

so, going back IN topic, what is MY definition of funtioning?
i started being functional in life when i started being the protagonist of my life, this isn't a direct symphtom of schizo, it's rather disconnection due to dysphoria, BUT being ""inside my body"", in turn, thanks to the work with the analyst, helped me recognizing delusion and discarding them as real. to help this process (if you have persecution's mania, thats what i had), whenever it happens, my line of thought is ""how many possibilities there are that a real person would do it? especially, either spending a lot in technologies, or spending a lot in studying it in order to mock me/ share my personal information and make people who walks under my street's home, or around in the town, gossip about me, recognizing me? and if there is a possibility (a stalker, a great criminal) what is their motive? the conclusion is always that there isn't.
so, this is for the ""delusion/paranoia"" 's part.
for what concerns auditory hallucination (my other main symphtom), i was putted on risperidone, and then olanzapine, after my last recovery in the psychward. i have a bit of holes in all the story, but shortly, february 2022, i started a man dose of testosterone.  and this slowly improved itself, so in march i started tapering.
my personal way of proving myself that voices aren't real is focusing on real sound around me, going near the window and open it, and stay there for a while, constantly focusing in external real sound. often, i neither hear real people near the house, at best there are kids playing in the garden after 2 houses. and they clearly can't talk about me, but even if they were, i couldn't logically distinguish their words.


 not functioning: either under antipsychotic or after quitting them as they weren't mandatory anymore, since 2018 i can see, in hindsight, that:
i worked, but my detach from my body and my mind (maybe i have also a context of hypogonadism in both thyroid and sexual axis so it's always tricky to blame only one disease, rather than a series of coincidences) made me slow, less focused, ""brain fogged"", with a shorter attention span, with a weaker ability of will, ( i struggled to don't let other's opinion condition my own action and even opinion). these factors, together with the voices and persecution paranoia symphtoms, (they were louder and frequent some times, and some other times less, but constantly present), obviously made my ability to work (therefore autonomy, money), to relationate with others, and even to learn something, in general, a slower and harder process. i always had contracts such little period of substitution, fixed term, obvioulsy, also not schizo people have the same contracts, the same struggle, but then, 1) they get quicker more easily as they learn. i struggled to learn, and it was a big lack of ability. as they have accumulated some experience, bosses usually delay the end of the fixed contract, and l, after years, maybe they would obtain an indefinite one. so, they were open to put trust in me, if i demonstrate to deserve it.
... i had a lot of these mini-contract, and for some reason i always ended discarded, without a call: the contract ended and i was no more an employee. no delay of the end of contract.

IN SHORT, non-functioning :

- detachement from reality
- brain fog
- shorter attention span
- weaker willness (conditioned from others)
- poorer ability to learn/ inability to go quicker in manual activity.
- poorer income (from 0 to 300. i started seeing 600 when i did deliveroo, but it's a lie because of taxes and fuel: net, it's at least a half) *and this is my personal objective criteria*

these factors, together with voices relapses and persecution paranoia, were the perfect recipe to not be autonomous, to reach my personal goals in life. 

so, what is functioning?
as i started seeing the masculinizating changes, i started being more active both in gym that at work, this could be explained with the chemical properity of testosterone... but also more present inside myself, more conscious that i'm not living my life like a first-person videogame. dht (conversion of testo in the body) is known to help with the positive mood (thats why a lot of men on trt aren't aggressive, it's a myth), and this leaded to be less passive and more ""pro-active"" in making things work as the main protagonist.
the fact that i had better progession in the gym, and a human income to buy my own things with the rider work and sometimes cleaning service, created together a virtuous circle. in the meanwhile, i think in march, i started tapering olanzapine, also because i noticed it let me sleep too much (12h) and i needed to go working for a cleaning service that started early in the morning... i lowered the dose by 2,5 a month. when it became too small of a dose, i preferred to take  it only when needed, instead of counting days (eod, every 2 days...) yesterday i took again a 2,5mg after months, because staying at home (i had a crash and i need a new moped, plus, i had a surgery and i couldn't workout... ) without a ""mission"" to complete, creates a great hole for voices to introduce themselves again... and i was struggling to fall asleep. at least the ban has been beneficial because i couldn't comment on reddit, and therefore voices hadn't the pretence to mock me...
my personal objective criteria to define my ""functioning"" is the fact ive been able to learn the map of my city, to learn how my works ""work"", and as a result, the better income, the less average time spent to deliver an order (that is calculated from the app)... 
because i used my own time instead of let it passing me by. 
i ALWAYS need an objective criteria to compare, because while was in worst condition i was swimming in symphtoms and i couldn't recognize my problems. don't trust nobody, neither yourself: find something that attaches you to reality.

... idk if it can be helpful for someone. it took me a lot to write, and at least i didn't do an angry post or comment under the sub where i've been reported UNFAIRLY.. because it would've lead to another ban 🫡
ehm i din't do... not for now 😁🤗

He has been having these paranoid delusions like the up stairs neighbors are following him and stuff like that, he was saying that the neighbor was walking the same direction back and forth whenever he would walk, that they are drilling in the ceiling and had me look for cameras in our vents, there was one time he had said that it was weird how the upstairs neighbors flushed the toilet at the exact same time as him, that when we were praying together the other night that the upstairs neighbor was laughing at us just like his mom and his mom died 4 years ago, as if he was making fun of us. Yesterday he wanted me to call the police and make a police report about the upstairs neighbor “harassing us” and for “invasion of privacy” when in reality the guy just walks heavy. I am not gonna call the cops or make a police report for someone being heavy footed. This neighbor is new and he was saying the exact same thing about the last tenants. Well earlier tonight I got fed up because this has been going on at this level for the past like year, he is really mad and hurt because he can’t believe that I don’t trust him or believe him, that it’s just an excuse to break up. I need to add that we got into a fight a couple months back. He scared me because there was a time he insinuated that he was going to go upstairs with our gun because he was pissed off at the neighbor. Well we got into it and I ended up saying I wanted to separate so I dug my own hole here with that. He was so upset at me because he couldn’t believe that I would think he would ever do such a thing to anyone.

He said he would go get one, but now we are in a worse spot than we have ever been relationship wise. I don’t know how to talk to him, but also validate my feelings at the same time. I have no family close and his family is out of state. I don’t want to split up, but I’m scared that he will lie to the psych to shove it in my face that he is perfectly normal.

For any individual, finding supportive resources and healthcare professionals that understand their needs and provide them with the necessary support is key to living life with schizophrenia.

It is also essential that society understands more about this disorder and views people with schizophrenia with a more open, supportive attitude. Treating them like any other person would help end existing negative stereotypes, and make it easier for those living with schizophrenia to lead a better life.

Having open conversations about mental health and focusing on early diagnosis and treatment can make a huge difference in the life of those living with schizophrenia. Honest dialog about what it’s like to live with a mental illness, and lifting the stigma around it, can result in increased understanding and compassion.

I know it’s a bad concept but I am working on it. But I also wanted to add a character who the Egyptian god of chaos and madness is trying to posses but in ways that mirror schizophrenia. For example: Paranoia where he’s scared the God will just barge down his door when the God has had enough, Insomnia where he doesn’t sleep for weeks as a form of mental torment from the god, Hallucinations just to break him down enough for him to agree to the Gods offer and so on. Overall the character will be surprisingly calm about this ordeal (May add a twist somewhere where it’s revealed he actually has schizophrenia so this is honestly nothing to him) and has even arranged a system for pills that slightly mute the gods connection (meds) but with their own side effects to them.

744,13x7iob,"Where I rant about psychology, as practiced by therapists...","(Note that all of the following applies only to psychology as practiced in the US. There may be exceptions to all of this even there. This is one of my usual very long rants, so if you don't want to read a very long rant, you can skip it.)

To get to the point: Therapists are cowards, and they're trained to be that way. All they ever do is reflect everything back on to you. It seems they are specifically trained to avoid offering solutions. I swear, I've been seeing therapists for decades, a not ONCE have I ever been offered a solution or a practical course of action to take. Maybe, just maybe, they might dwell on coping mechanisms but even that is just regulating how you feel. Feelings, always feelings. That's all they ever care about. Never have I been offered hard-hitting constructive criticism, that actually risks hurting my feelings. Instead, they dance around issues while I rant and vent, never offering anything useful.

For years, I was 100% sold on the lie offered by society that therapy was where you go to fix things. Because I'm messed up, right? I've even got multiple, fancy diagnoses to tell me how messed up I am. Psychology is supposed to fix things, right? I mean, if they're so good at defining problems, surely there's ample motivation to find solutions.

But no, that's not my experience at all. A therapist's office is where I go to talk for an hour about my issues, about as productively as talking to a wall. Need life advice about what course of action to take? Sorry, you're SOL. Gotta find you're own answers, and as long as it's better than throwing yourself off a tall building they'll usually go along with it. Will they help you find productive steps to implement a goal? No, that's not their job.

I'm a firm believer that schizophrenia is a real problem. It needs to be dealt with. Other than being in a clinical setting that basically restrains me while I am in crisis mode (i.e. during hospitalizations), the field of psychology as I see it is completely devoid of bold, decisive action.

Medication helps me. Psychiatry has its flaws, but at least it has provided results. But in decades of therapy and multiple therapists, I feel like all I've done is waste time. All the while, feeling that is it practically mandatory and the only possible solution.

But have I surrendered completely and just given in to all of my problems? No, not by a long shot. I've decided to turn wholeheartedly to one of the few things that provides me regular solutions: Ancient wisdom. For me, that means religion and philosophy.

Let's face it. People in modern times aren't that much different than people from the past. If you believe they are, you are at the very least intensely naive or profoundly arrogant. The wisdom of the ancients has survived for centuries because it applies so effectively to the human condition. It has stood the test of time, and most errors have long-since been refined out of existence. Note that I am talking about wisdom dealing with the human condition, which is often interspersed with teachings of the supernatural that you do not even need to believe in to benefit from said wisdom.

Most modern psychology is hardly ground-breaking. At it's most insightful, it is often rediscovering what has already been know in some way, shape or form by cultures hundreds or thousands of years ago. Again, ancient wisdom has stood the test of time. As for psychology: I recently read that psychology experiments have a successful replication rate of 30%. That means 70% of the time, what is ""discovered"" in psychology doesn't even stand up to real scrutiny. Thanks, but I'll take my religion and philosophy.

To be fair, not much of ancient wisdom deals with the practicalities of dealing with psychosis. Then again, neither have my therapists. Natch. But at least ancient wisdom and religion offers me a framework for life with measurable, practical benefits. And maybe I'm just lucky in that I've done enough work to combine wisdom with spirituality that the combination allows me to indeed, successfully approach some aspects of schizophrenia as a spiritual problem with therapeutic benefits. Or maybe better than therapy, actually. 

Naturally, I must include the disclaimer that society will collapse if you don't listen to psychologists and that I am not a trained psychologist with a degree. Therefore, in a clinical setting my opinions have the standing of a pile of dog shit. Of course, no therapist would ever say that to may face. It would hurt my feelings. But as for you, I welcome you to make up your own mind. No one else is going to figure it out for you.",5,1
745,13x5x7y,Delusion,"Around 15 years ago, when I was very symptomatic, I called 911 because I thought that the Prime Minister of my province (Quebec) was conspiring against me with the healthcare professionals, entering my home, spying on me through hidden cameras. I found a piece of paper under my desk saying QC Passed which I thought was saying that the government had been there. I was very worried that they would interfear with my receiving my disability payments. The 911 emergency agent got really upset and yelled at me... today I think he thought it was a prank. Today I believe that ""QC Passed"" only means that the item from which the sticker fell off, had passed the Quality Control test.

784,13wgq1c,How seeing my aunt struggling with psychosis impacted my life decisions in research,"We all know someone that has struggled with mental health and know how impactful it can be. In my personal case, I saw a close relative having a psychotic episode. At the time, I didn't quite understand what was happening, as I was only a child. As the years went by, and this topic became less of a taboo in my family, I now understand what my aunt went through. I have vivid memories of seeing my aunt, and not recognizing her, it was her, but without her usual energy and spark. In the early years of her recovery, she could not work, she had lost her close friendship connections, and it seemed that she was not really “there”. She was struggling with the negative symptoms of psychosis. As the years passed, her recovery journey kept improving. Now, she is able to work, she is more participative in family events, and she started swimming and taking long walks around the city again. I feel genuinely so happy to see that she was able to have the support and treatments she needed in order to regain a life that she is proud of and that gives her a sense of purpose.

It is interesting to look back on what might have influenced some of our most important life decisions. For me personally, the close contact I have had with psychosis, and seeing the impact it can have, not only on the person but also on the family, has inspired me to pursue a career in Clinical Psychology, and later a PhD in this topic. I am passionate about the study of innovative treatments for psychosis. The idea that I can contribute to improving someone's quality of life, drives me every day to learn more, and to do more. That is why I am currently conducting a study to understand how brain stimulation can be used to treat negative symptoms of psychosis. For my aunt (and so many others), it is the persistence of the negative symptoms that continues to impact their day-to-day life. And contrary to other symptoms, such as hallucinations that usually respond well to medication, there is a lack of effective treatments for the negative symptoms.

The idea behind this approach is that by applying a weak electric current to the brain, we can boost the activity of brain areas involved in the symptoms of psychosis. I am very excited about this because it is not invasive (no surgery is needed), it is very well tolerated and not painful, and it is safe (no severe adverse effects are expected). Currently, a study is taking place at the UZ Brussel, and it will allow us to understand the mechanism of action of brain stimulation. Specifically, we will be able to measure the effect of the stimulation on brain activity, how it impacts the “communication” between different brain areas, and how social and emotional functions are changed. To be able to measure brain activity, participants will undergo a brain scan (functional magnetic resonance imaging). The results of this study will contribute to future clinical studies about noninvasive brain stimulation as a treatment potential for the symptoms of psychosis.

791,13ws9z4,Political Logic,"Some of the symptoms of schizophrenia are medicalized specifically because the capitalist West deems such behavior unprofitable. 

Take the overwhelming feeling of being watched. This is deemed “delusional.” But just taking a historical look at America shows this to not be a delusion; it’s just a fact. 

Snowden proved the NSA was spying on millions of Americans, and that the Five Eyes are producing a supranational surveillance state! What is someone honestly supposed to do with this information?! 

You’re drugged if you take offense to the blatant FACT that you have no privacy. The logic: “we’d rather not deal with you feeling freaked out from basic violations of human rights.” 

Even the concept of hallucinations bothers me. It’s defined as receiving stimuli without external reference. But philosophically, we have no objective way of proving that people aren’t either gaslighting you or just not aware of what you’re aware of. 

We have no idea the full extent of the technology researched and developed by the CIA. They burned most of the documentation of Mk Ultra; that’s another fact that society is just casual about. You’re expected not to be paranoid about a basic and documented thing! 

So the government can illegally experiment on you, knowing you’ll never be believed, and the resulting trauma is dismissed as a personal issue that you’re just going to have to deal with. 

That’s how the West deals with schizophrenia: dismissive. It is very profitable for you to be atomized and confused, taking experimental drugs in the vague hope that a self inflicted chemical lobotomy will make life in a country gradually descending into open Fascism bearable. 

There’s hope though. Forums like this allow you to actually reflect on your symptoms. You can survive, and build something. Lots of people deal with schizophrenia, and in other cultures, it isn’t treated as a freakish aberration needing neutralizing.",1,1

799,13w7a35,My mind is... breaking apart,"Hello dear r/schizophrenia redditors!

I'd like to ask you a question, because I feel absoluetly paraniod and super alone. It's going to a be a little bit long of a post.

Also, english is not my first language. So sorry for mistakes. I try my very best to express myself.


I feel like i'm not myself. Sometimes I can switch between the ""normal/instinctive reactions"" and, then I can switch to ""I write this right now"". For me, this sentence has a different meaning. It started somethimg like. I have a brain inside me and I don't know if I am myself...

It feels like I am really, really, really overthinking. I don't go out with friends because I am very afraid and I always think I am not good enough. I had a really, really traumatising experience with school in my childhood. And since then I always get these kind of thoughts. For ex. I always seem to find an excuse on why not to go out with my friends. This excuse right now is: ""I am not good enough for them."" I also had some really brutal thoughts when I was younger and I am forcing myself not to think of these. For ex. (Little bit of +18 part coming, might be a trigger for someone.) For some reason I sometimes thought about my mom getting decapitated when I was little. And I also have a cat and had a thought about killing/hurting him.
I don't like these thoughts. I understand it comes from childhood trauma. I never did anything like this and I feel like my mind is EXPLODING every and all day.

I get super scared when I... Don't know I am paranoid. I just want to close my eyes and sleep. Some days are better, some days are worse. Whilst i'm writing this i'm on a rollecoaster of feelings.

I get paranoid because I realise I am a person and I am... Don't know. I know this last sentence doesn't make any sense, this is the only way I can describe this horrible experience when I turn my Attention to my head/brain/myself. (Maybe this all is just the trauma. I never really ever translated my mother tongue's sentences to english and now I struggled a bit.

I wanted to ask you what do you think about this?

Psychiatry didn't help. I don't know even if I need help. Finishing this writing already made my mind a little bit better.

What are your advices?

I do feel better. This is werid. So I guess writing helps a lot already.",10,1

801,13w1v06,Rising slowly after discovering i'm schizophrenic with 31,"So, this is the 8th month after a psychotic break i had. I'm still 30% functional only but at least now i regained the ability to make conversations with people and write.

  
My relationship with schizophrenia is weird: i was always halluctinating vividly and i thought, i BELIEVED until i was 11 that this life was actually my old self rewatching the memories of his past life. Everything was the Truman Show with Old Truman as the sole expectator. I used to talk to the camera men i was sure were behind the courtains, when i was introduced to the concept of God i spent years trying to not feel ashamed cause God saw me naked whenever i showered or went to the bathroom.  
The first time i went on anti psychotics when i was 20, i discovered that 70% of what i used to hear all the time were hallucinations. But finally now i understood i am schizophrenic and i finally found the key to my freedom: i thought all of that was normal because my entire family is psychotic. Yeah, my mom says i'm actually touched by God and she and dad's entire family sees God, have revelations and hallucinate clearly. I began to understand why all of them followed the same path and ""lost in life"". All of them religious people who lost their families, women and men.

I'm 54 and he's 50. I see him maybe once or twice a year as I live close to 700 miles away. His only significant connection is with my mom who is 80. They see each other maybe once a month as she's at the end of her rope in regards to listening to him, talking to him and trying to help him. He refuses ANY help as everything is FINE in his world. He hasn't worked in the last 15 years and lives like a hermit. No one is allowed in his house. He lives off inheritance money. He doesn't drink or do drugs yet his appearance would lead you to believe he lives on Skid Row.

Over the years his personal hygiene has degraded and now were clearly at a new low. I cannot not say anything about it anymore. He eats once a day at the restaurant - he doesn't cook for himself - and I fear what will happen next is they'll simply refuse to serve him because he looks so disheveled. 

Because of his anosognosia how the heck do I talk to him about this? If he doesn't have the insight of bathing himself anymore how will this situation ever be resolved? How long can someone not bathe themselves? 

Also my mom is a frail 80, don't know how much time she has left. I feel he will never have the gumption  to leave his house. He is very skinny and I feel he'll simply completely fade away in his home. Is this a reality I should accept?

My latent schizophrenia triggered when I moved abroad and was constantly hearing a foreign language around me, and all the schizophrenic voices in my first psychosis were in that language not my native language. In psychosis I had ""the voices"" and only had other (non-voice) auditory hallucinations or visual hallucinations a couple times.

I'm wondering if I specifically developed auditory hallucinations or schizophrenia because I've trained my oral language muscles / had too much language-related stress or something. Obviously there's no way to know for sure but it'd be interesting if there's research or other schizophrenics out there who were in a similar situation when it developed",2,1
814,13wf6xp,Pleading for help with my Fiance (34f) who refuses to go to doctor but has a MRI for headaches tomorrow morning. Can I have them look for schizophrenia or psychosis in the MRI? I just need some sort of evidence that this si what is happening so she can stop this religious delusion and headaches,"Hi, this inquiry is for me (34m) about my fiance (44f) who experiences, is what I am now figuring out, is psychosis. I am writing this while she sleeps(very rare but takes frequent naps) She has been diagnosed with **bipolar**(unsure which one) and **depression** (this was after suicide attempt using xanax . She ate my entire bottle in late 2019. This all started very heavily on us after her suicide attempt. She told me the reason why she did it was to make me happy(which ive never understood becuase I thought that I had always showed her love).This entire thing has been a gigantic everlasting delusion for her and has about ruined our relationship. She went from defending me (voices said I was cheating along with all sorts of other things) to completely disregarding me. From hearing voices in the ring camera (i put these up to prove to her the voices weren't me because I was getting accused of all sorts of irrational and impossible things. The camera only fued the delusions (I was not aware what they were and was nearly sucked into a delusional state myself due to it.  


Important things to consider. All of these things were leading up to and are important to note.  


She was and has been on meth the entire time.  
She fell, right when I met her 8 years ago, and broke her back and collapsed 4 vertebrae.

She has lots of childhood trauma from her dad being a complete POS her now, deceased Mother. She died from cancer about 2 year maybe 3 prior.She watched her mom put up with abuse her entire life coupled with physical abuse from her father onto her. She has never had any therapy from this.  
We just lost  all 4 of our great danes to  bone cancer (she had them before I met her). The dogs were and are OUR kids. The first dog died while she was in the mental institution.

 Fast forward to know, we have been through it all, Truman show, gangstalking, spirits, demons. She thinks that one of her voices is a jealous, murdeous, rapist gangstalker. At first, she thought the gangstalk to which she refers to as Mia or Jillian. Mia was jealous of her and I's  amazing rerelationship and wanted to kill her and then act like she was my fiance once she was dead in order to get me. That evolved into Mia trying to block her from talking to Satan (about 6 months ago this began). She thinks the gangstalkers are able to block Satan-Big G (god)- and Chistopher (Jesus) from stopping the lases and energy weapons directed at her by the goverment and when this happens, she gets super pissed off. She will completely disregard my feelings and the overall fact im in the house. She will scream and yell at them saying the same things over and over. She will punch and throw things. She repetitively writes the same thing over and over in her journals (which I have read and have pictures of to help me better understand what is happening to her. The day I read I LOVE Satan (6 months ago) with hearts all around it everything changed. I went from kind of pushing it to the side because I felt helpless due to the fact it was either the government or some demon. Of course, I was hurt, confused and blown away and essentially dealt with the situation as if I were being cheated on. I know this was wrong but I hadnt quite reached shizophernia yet. I even spent 2k to have a medium ward off evil spirits (stupid I know).

&#x200B;

All of her delusions that were once circled around me (years of her thinking I was cheating, talking bad about her, other people and customers talking bad about her, government sneaking in an putting up cameras and people trying to bodysnatch her to clone her to steal me. To completely replacing my name with Jesus and able to give up our relationship. She has also repressed all emotions in hopes for the gangstalkers not to steal her sparkle"". She has displayed disorganized speech, auditory hallucinations, tactile hallucinations (sexual and thinks she was raped by gangstalkers), tarkive syndrome, serious headaches,finger writing, jumping and flapping her arms, making bird sounds, paranoia, isolation, loss in overall function (dosent clean, take care of herself, have any sexual contact or emotional contact with me and I  was everything to her not to long ago. There is sooo much more to this multilayer delusion and Im sure you guys dont need a book to answer my question. have around 1400 photos of her journals which is basically everything that she has going on in her mind, and it helps me alot.

Just recently, I have nailed down Shizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder along with delusional disorder, but she will not hear it and will not get help. I have tried everything, and she refuses treatment. We have an MRI tomorrow for her persistent, daily migraines (another symptom of the disease). How do I go about having the doctor look for schizophrenia or will they be able to see it based off of the morphology of the brain? Shes been in psychosis and completely delusional for what seems to be over a year maybe 2 now, and has gotten really hostile about me even bringing it up. She pretty much hates me for not being there at the most important time of her life ( but I was one room over?)

What are some pieces of advice? How can I help her get help without there being a future incident? Also, I didn't mention this before we have been together 8 years, and now, she is totally content with giving up on the relationship due to this. Shes acts like she doesn't care at all about me. We haven't been intimate or sexual since February. Should I be bracing for the end very soon or are there ways to help her realize that she is in psychosis or having delusions. Is there anything I can do to have the doctors look for this specifically so she can try to rationalize this and hopefully move forward and maybe get our relationship back?

I am hanging on because this woman loved me more than I have ever been loved and was the sweetest most caring and compassionate person I had ever met. She stuck by me when noone else would. Her appearance is changing, her bring and overall demeanor and attitude is completely 180 degrees different in her mood, actions, and beliefs. She went from being not really religious too all kinds of religious and about God, but that didn't stop her headaches (which she says are laser being shot at her by gangstalking demons, to read her mind and to steal her thoughts so that this gangstalker Jillian and her other gangstalkers (who is now dead and is a spirit and has an army of witches and demons.  Shes acts childish,is  hurtful with care or remorse, uncaring, non sympathetic, and very hypocritical. For example, anything that she had made a big deal about during our relationship (my behaviors, actions or words) she has adopted and does right back to me without any sort of care. She is breaking me down and daily as soon as I wake up I realize this isn't a nightmare and that its now my reality and its completely dysfunctional. She will argue with her voices and write all day without moving. Shes goes several days without showing. I need help! All of this research had made me realize that this is causing me to be delusional and is affecting my overall mental health, self-esteem, and has ruined her life, our relationship and now my life completely.",1,1

838,13vcstn,Can I have a successful career with schizophrenia? (Currently in medical school),"I F24 am currently undergoing diagnosis for schizophrenia as my psychiatrist and psychologist both agree I am showing early signs. They want to prevent things from getting any worse. 

I am feeling a bit disheartened by this, I am currently in medical school and I want to be a doctor, specifically a neurosurgeon or possibly psychiatrist (not sure yet). But now I’m wondering how I could even do this if I had schizophrenia. I would love to hear other’s experiences. Thanks.

Edit: Thank you for all the kind responses, it has helped me feel a bit better and hopeful about my situation :) - I was especially worried about it since I’m in my least year of med school and it’s pretty expensive so it would be very unfortunate if I had to back out now and not pursue my dreams, and I would be in a LOT of debt, plus it was very difficult for me to get here. Hopefully since this has been caught on early, my symptoms will be able to be managed well with medication.",27,1
839,13vjgcj,Started antipsychotics again and need some positive stories,"I just started taking antipsychotics (Haldol) after a lot of serious psychotic breaks I’ve had the last couple months. 

Two years ago I had my first psychotic break which scared me so much I started antipsychotics (Olanzapine) almost immediately. The symptoms went away mostly but the side effects were a bitch. I gained 15 kilo’s, slept all day and I couldn’t even feel close to the people I love most. I took them for one year and started slowly getting off of them under supervision.

So the past few months I tried to tell myself that I could handle all the psychotic breaks I’ve had and I’ll be okay. Starting antipsychotics would be the last thing I wanted to do.

I just started taking Haldol. In only two days I started to see benefits already. My memory started to get a bit better and self care started to get effortless almost. 

But I’m still very scared of the side effects that could occur. I’m terrified of gaining weight (I most likely would also have an eating disorder) and loosing interest in everything and everyone. 

All the experiences I read here about antipsychotics are negative (which I get) but I also want to get better and try to stay on my medication. I’ve tried these meds before and convinced myself and my psychiatrist I didn’t need them.

So long story short I came here to ask for advice and for some personal positive stories on antipsychotics and/or haldol.",9,1

But after I thought about that question, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. The thought of getting it terrifies me, and I ended up having an anxiety attack while working because of it. I made it through the rest of my shift and made it home. I told my mom who is a nurse, and she told me if I would have got it, it would have been years ago and I believe her. But the thought still lingered in the back of my head all night and I woke up in the middle of the night, and in an attempt to calm myself down, my heart started racing. My mom told me that my blood pressure was high and I’m going to look into getting a doctor’s appointment after my current shift.

851,13vlkyu,Schizophreniform And Alcohol,"Hey guys, so as the title suggests I've got Schizophreniform. And one of the disadvantages of suffering with it is there aren't a lot of resources or information regarding symptoms and other things like that as much as ""generic"" (so to speak) schizophrenia. So this is why I thought I might turn to this sub, hope you all don't mind. 

Anyways, I had this teacherless ""end of school"" event a few days ago and got drunk for the first time (was sheltered for a while, didn't want to create a dependance on the substance, yadiyadiyada) and the two friends (they know of my condition) that took care of me while I was in that state told me that I ""spoke to walls"" a lot and at some point even opened an empty bathroom stall and ""spoke into the empty darkness"" of it. I would apparently say something to ""someone"", then reply to what I had just said. At the time, I believed that what I was saying back to myself was in a different voice coming from whatever I was talking to (I do not remember much from that night at all- especially what I saw, I remember a little bit of what I said and heard however, if that makes sense?). When I was told this I found it quite funny considering that I had never heard of alcohol causing people to see and hear things, but I was then told by my friends that this was because it *doesn't* happen to drunk people. 

I asked a few more people in my surroundings and they told me the same thing. So I also looked it up and apparently this does happen on very rare occasions but only to people that drink consistently over long periods of time, such as alcoholics. And as mentioned previously, I had never quite gotten drunk before, only tipsy a year or so ago with some friends and on New Years with my family. So I asked specifically in regards to schizophrenia (since it's basically impossible to find anything for schizophreniform) and alcohol's effect on it and a few papers have found that all alcohol does to schizophrenics is bring some kind of euphoric effect, which makes sense to what I was feeling because I honestly had never felt as ""free"" as I did while drunk then. Also, those two friends also told me that I could *not* stop grinning the entire night. 

The thing is, my last ""episode"" was during November/December/January and after being medicated (for the first time) on Olanzapine for a month and then Quetiapine for another my symptoms left completely. Which is a normal occurence for my disorder but I'm just worried that I may have accelerated their return by getting drunk. I'm just so worried about when my next episode might happen because life without symptoms feels so peaceful and I finally feel alive without the need for all of the meds (fell asleep in class three times due to Quetiapine I think, horrible horrible) and lack of night terrors. 

So I guess that's what I wanted to ask you all, have you (especially schizophreniforms, please) experienced the same thing with alcohol or am I just overthinking it and it's just a ""typical"" thing drunk people experience? Also, I guess it would just be nice to know there are other schizophreniforms out there, especially some that feel the same anxiety towards ""the waiting"" for episodes to return. 

Take care everyone.",2,1

I care for my wife who was formally diagnosed a couple of years ago, been in and out of hospital with schizophrenia over the past decade. We have young children, and had to go bankrupt with family business after the first hospital trip. Anyway we had a tough journey but finally qualified for PIP (UK disability) and UC we receive 'carer element' and 'limited capacity for work' etc.

She has not been able to engage in anything deeply for many years but recently started a creative project that is motivated by wanting to earn some pocket money. Although she's finding it tiring, and requires a lot of support, she is well along with it. She has not begun monetising the project, (it's not anywhere near that stage yet) but we aren't sure how to report earnings to UC. Any earnings would likely be very sporadic. And we're not talking megabucks. Think selling artwork etc. What's the avenue for this?

I have heard that with carer element, for each £1 earned, £1 is deducted. This has been a major blow to her confidence and is dramatically affecting her outlook/recovery not to mention our relationship. What do I do?

869,13vd0pk,Someone help me please,"So over the last 11 months I have been slowly on a decline in my life, I'm hoping that what I'm experiencing is schizophrenia but I don't know very much about it. 

The symptoms first started around October last year,
As mild auditory hallucinations, that came and went with some drug use. I figure hey it's just the drugs right?. Since then it is now May and I have been experiencing auditory hallucinations ( or at least that's what I call it) for a 8 weeks solid from the time I wake up to the time I fall asleep. 

I've also gained a unique ability to picture things extremely clearly in my mind for the first time in my life. I've never had much of an imagination but it seems like now it's become extremely active.

One of the things I've done over the last few months is challenge the 4 voices they are the voices of my Ex partner, my abusive father who only speaks during a time of discpline but has actually recently changed from that to a more compassionate approach, which is VERY strange considering the fact that the only memory i have of him is him yelling, some random woman I do not know who is apprently my exs best friend, and a man that assimilates to different positions of law enforcement or criminal profiler. The names of the profiler have changed, but my Ex and father have remained the same.

I have had extremely strange reactions to the transfer of internal dialog to an external hallucination, where I have had a thought and someone in the community basically revealed one of the most private things I thought. I have moved to cities where I knew absolutely no one and had someone finger me out of a crowd as if they knew everything about me. 

I have challenged the voices to speak French as I am bilingual and suddenly, two of them overlapping got extremely angry that I was speaking French and explained to me that only my father was embarrassed about this ""program"" because he never learnt how to speak French. An emotion that I never knew he had concerning the language. 

Words that I have never used have been introduced into the dialogue as well.

Over the last month I have been paying attention to my emotions and have realized that each emotion I have had has almost it's own audio playback that repeats, like if I take a deep breath and sigh, a voice will robotically or like a computer say ""aggrevation"" then the human like voices will laugh. 

I have tried to commit suicide 7 times in the last 2 months. Warning graphic.

As soon i drove a kitchen knife into my wrist twice and began bleeding into the sink the voices instantly changed from kill yourself to what the fuck are you doing stop it and fix your self, clean up the mess. Ive always been under the impression that schizophrenic voices will stop at nothing in berating you into commiting suicide. But the dialogue changes so often from negative to, ""were just trying to help you understand there are consequences to your actions"". 

I have heard key words and phrases and uses of figures of speech. Which believe it or not in Canada is a way to reinforce the freedom of speech without getting into trouble. The figure of speech is in regards to a program created by law enforcement called necessary evil, or a bullet to the head. The only apparent way for someone to be rehabilitated. 

I'm doing my best right now not to seem paranoid about law enforcement. But they are seemingly involved in the dialog.

The narrative of experiences are as follows

1st). I experienced auditory hallucinations that a serial killer was hunting me across Canada from the 4th dimension, which is hilarious because I don't believe in that kind of stuff.

2nd). Next came the idea that I was a vegetable and I'm too mentally incapable to do anything on my own. And that being lobotomized was the only answer.

3rd). A rehabilitation program intended to either make me kill myself or turn myself into the police with threats of doing life in prison for the audio that the ""voices"" have created in order to manipulate me into complying.

4th). Every city I have moved to I hear the name of the city followed by ""wants nothing to do with you"". 

Each voices spends a great amount of time elaborating how there trying to help me.
And I spend a large amount of time in my head passing them off. It's almost like a game. 

THE CONSTANT OF EACH SCENARIO: turn my self in to the police department for charges that arent even real. I have called the police on myself 3 different times now to find out if im wanted and even had two officers bring me to the hospital, then release me.
 

The strangest part about this experience is something called electrical interference. Whenever anything electric fires up intense hallucinations occur, but I can actually hear conversations of the voices underneath the hallucinations. Which makes no sense to me. Also do the voices in schizophrenia speak to each other almost as if im not listening? Like as if they're  planning something against me.

Now I know this is going to sound extremely crazy, but what if you could prove that you aren't schizophrenic and that your being made to believe you mentally ill when you've been in front of psychs and have no diagnoses. I have recorded my voice, speaking inside my Mind coming out of a television speaker confirmed by another human being who was not under any influence. Can someone please explain to me how that would be possible. I have heard they have technology out there from companies like ""brain wave"". To be literal that would be the exact definition of telepathy. Which isn't real. 

I'm asking someone to message me, a kind of professional courtesy from either a specialist in the field of psychology or someone who has had a similar experience. I would really appreciate the help, honestly I'm tired of trying to kill myself.

880,13v3goe,Death or people around me feeling really sick not affecting me in any way? Except for my dogs.,"Since pretty much everyone in my family/ people that I know are getting really sick from illnesses (hard times as always because things cant go well for once in my f*cking life) but I don’t feel anything? 
I just feel sad/anxious when my dogs get sick, but other than that I really don’t care. Because of this people of course don’t want advice from me (since I just reply with generic stuff that I already heard). I am not empathetic at all. 
Anyone else?

882,13uz6xy,Is there anything at all I can do to prevent myself from developing this disorder? I have early symptoms and my dad was schizophrenic. I have risk factors too.,"Hi, so, Im not going to go into detail, and I am going to talk to my doctor like, ASAP. But sometimes they dismiss these things so I want to know what you think. 

Again if I go into it it'll become a whole vent, I already wrote one out and deleted it. But I seem to have a lot of risk factors for schizophrenia. I already experience psychosis, paranoia and negative symptoms. But I don't think it's fully developed. 

But I show so many early signs of schizophrenia, I have extreme fear about unlikely things, I have a lot of the risk factors for it including high stress, and my dad had schizophrenia, and died from it. Unfortunately we are very similar. Since he died I've been going in the same direction he did, it's quite scary. 

I'm terrified of developing this, because I'm extremely scared, of fear. And I feel a lot of it. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I already have no grip on reality. I already can't tell between reality and imagination. 

I just want to know what I can do now to prevent this from developing. I'm already on antipsychotic medication and it keeps me alive but it doesn't stop all of it. I'm on a low dose but any higher and the side effects just about kill me. 

What can I do? I know I may need to make medication changes but please, other than that? I'm going to ask my doctor but do you know how I can prevent this?",6,1

884,13uwmvv,What happens if your misdiagnosed with schizophrenia,"I think I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia. I have a history of amphetamine abuse (soft versions of it like adderall) and I think that the doctor did not take this into consideration when he prescribed me paliperidone. I went into hospital after a drug induced bout of psychosis that involved delusions that I could not get rid of and was given paliperidone and about 3 weeks after the psychosis ended. I have stopped using all substances but am still on paliperidone and everyone in my life wants me to continue… The thing is I have only ever had psychosis as a result of drug use and sleep deprivation from drug use. I don’t know what to do. They really will not accept this, nor will the doctor.",5,1
885,13v268k,Advice for helping a sibling with schizophrenia,"My Brother has had schizophrenia for the last 25 years and has been living with my parents (who are almost 80)  for that entire time.

My father now has full on Alzheimers and my mother is at her breaking point as dealing with my brother is bad enough, my dad is a full time job. Mom can't even kick my brother out of the house as he now has rights to stay there because she supported him for so long it is now his official residence. My brother is a danger to them as he has done things like cut the main power to the house with gardening shears ( I don't know how he did this without electrocuting himself) and knock down doors, punching out windows etc. I have read that there is multiple month injections that if he could at least get one that he would be well enough that maybe he would keep them going but we can't compel him to do anything.

I’m wanting to switch from Paliperidone (Invega) to Cariprazine (Vraylar and Reagila). I’m worried about the general long term brain shrinkage from second generation antipsychotics(Atypicals) and also to try to help the negative and cognitive symptoms that feel more present on medication.

I’m not currently on a high dose of Invega and I do feel levelled out but I feel like having my reward centres completely blocked rather than regulated is stopping me from moving forward in my recovery. (I’m almost at 1 year of post hospitalization after roughly 2 years of psychosis)

890,13uxw2p,Just need to vent,"Today has been a difficult day. The voices ask me when I’m going to kill myself constantly. One asked if they should shoot me in the head last night and then actually tried. I only knew about it because another voice (which I can’t hear) started laughing hysterically. She is not so bad. She often laughs at the absurdity of the voices, but I have a harder time fielding their questions because I can hear a voice inside my head answering them. I don’t want to answer them. I choose to ignore them yet there’s still a part of my brain that actually answers. They ask if the voices ever go away! They are the voices! I find myself crying one minute and laughing hysterically the next. Emotional regulation is difficult. I wouldn’t mind the voices if I didn’t answer them. That’s the part that pisses me off. I could easily ignore them yet a part of my brain won’t! It’s so invasive and disgusting. I still can’t believe my brain can produce such awful thoughts. I was taking olanzapine for about 1.5 years when I suddenly developed severe akathesia and abruptly stopped. I’m very fortunate to have been admitted into a trial for a new drug that’s being tested specifically for schizophrenia, but I’ve only been on it for 4 days. It’s clearly not working. I’m engaging with them more than I should out of sheer frustration. I HATE that I answer them! They tried to convince me yesterday that I was going to die of breast cancer. I honestly didn’t care. I’d rather die of that than this. I recently started researching states that allow euthanasia (it’s EXPENSIVE to die with dignity) because it’s comforting to know that there’s a way out of this nightmare. I don’t fear death, but I do fear what will happen to me as I age if these meds don’t work. Sleep has been extremely difficult. Just as I’m drifting off I’m hit with images that startle me awake. Last night I had my first night terror and woke up moaning. Thank God my mother heard me and woke me up because I couldn’t get myself out of it even though I realized it was a dream. I don’t know how I’m going to function without sleep. Naps are impossible and the sleep deprivation makes everyday tasks more difficult. Sometimes it feels like the voices switch, almost like what I imagine DID feels like. Hearing them feels so invasive and the questions about when I’m going to kill myself are relentless sometimes. I do get breaks, thank God, but I just need to know that these meds are going to work. I’m 40 years old and live with my parents but they’re obviously aging and won’t be around forever. I don’t really have an extended family that can help and my younger sister needs to work full time to support herself. Some days are better than others but it’s the inconsistency that gets me down. I’ve been considering applying for disability just to keep me afloat while I’m waiting to see what happens with these meds but it’s so defeating. I find mornings to be most difficult. I usually wake up with anxiety and a sense of depletion and poor mood. This illness is such garbage, especially when part of my delusions feel like memories of a woman telling me that this was going to happen to me. I just want my mind back. I used to daydream and I can barely hold onto a mental image at this point. There’s no refuge from this crap. It’s in my waking life and my dreams. I do not fear death. I’m almost wishing for it at this point, but I’d feel awful if I had to battle a terminal illness with cruel, insulting voices. That’s why euthanasia is so attractive to me at this point. Apologies for such a long rant. This has just been so difficult. It’s hard to feel powerless. The mind is everything and to feel it being taken and compromised is terrifying and heartbreaking. I just need to know that this is going to get better. The voices try to convince me that the meds won’t work.",5,1

892,13v35pv,How do I quit weed,"So I've struggled with weed addiction (its a real thing...) for over 10 years in my life, I'm now 26.

For years, weed has being anxiety inducing, and it gives me delusional thoughts l, especially if I smoke too much.

I really really need to quit, like as of 5 years ago. My brain craves the crap so much but I cannot do it anymore. I have a few days here and there clean, or even a month or two, but I end up getting depressed and going back to it.

For those of you who struggled with schizophrenic symptoms because of weed, how did you get yourself to stop?!?

When I'm high I have delusional thoughts, and it seems like sometimes there are voices (inaudible) in my head. Lately, I have also been seeing alot of things in the corners of my eyes, and other visual distortions.

Please give me any advice, I want to stop smoking this crap. My brain loves it but I hate it",2,1

911,13u7j1o,PTSD from becoming homeless and losing everything during psychosis,"I have PTSD from my psychosis experience. I stopped leaving my house and working until I was evicted and 3 weeks up until I was evicted I had no money to pay my electricity so I was without power and in the dark for 3 weeks leading up to the eviction and ran out of money for food 6 weeks up until the eviction, I don't even know how I survived. I was eventually hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia and finally out of psychosis now living with family but I can't stop thinking about what happened to me and how fast I declined. I feel so bad for my poor dog and cat who always had food but it was traumatic especially finally getting evicted with cops literally kicking my ass out. For 2 days I slept in a bathroom and then went home to family. I haven't told anyone in my family just how bad it was with the no power etc but I can't stop thinking about it. The whole time I thought I was on a special mission from God / discovered aliens and this was just a part of it, now I'm out of it and literally scarred for life. I look back and don't even know how I am alive. I was normal and doing so well, just bought a new car etc (of course got reposseed 6 weeks prior to eviction). What's really scary too is that I thought this was all normal and part of it, thank God I went to family because I was this close to being on the streets. I'm haunted by these memories",41,1

915,13uirp4,My mindset,"I try to be all loving and caring and kind and try to not judge others. I think I thought about the idealized version of myself based on my values and tried to be that. Because I decided to randomly one day after I was inspired by someone who is amazing and gave a stranger a big hug when they were crying. 

But over time since then I've gone through different phases of my life,  some where I just wanted to have fun,  some where I just wanted to escape specific situations and do something meaningful. And some where I stopped caring about everything and felt hopeless.

But psychosis made me idealize about the relief of suffering, believe in God again, and think about a lot of things and ask a lot of hard questions about the kind of person I want to be and gave me perspective on experiencing, a deeper understanding of how hard things can get, and how much people I love mean to me.

Some of the things that drove me was creating a better relationship with my voices,  thinking that if they are a part of me or if they are really people, I would become someone so loving and amazing that my voices would be kind to me through shaping my subconscious or inspiring the people who were doing this to me to become loving and compassionate. Also there was the fear of going to hell and the desire to please God. I saw berries falling from the sky. I thought God was talking to me or testing me. I thought I was in hell and felt like we could bring heaven to earth and abolish hell and eternal torment out of compassion for all beings.

At the same time, I have been failing and falling out of good healthy routines and my ability to take care of basic things and gotten lazy due to lack of motivation and due to the pain of doing hard things. I still feel like I should be doing more. I don't leave my house except for a few times a month mostly for getting my meds and cigarettes and the few good days I have that I have more motivation and a reason to go out. I've been failing more at doing things that require physical effort, instead resting on my porch smoking or laying on my couch on my phone.

I've rationalized this as focusing on the things that really matter, being kind and loving, and still trying to help others when they come into my life and sometimes when I encounter problems on social media (like reddit) and trying to be as helpful as I can without having to physically move and encounter people irl who I care about, but I still feel scared and uncomfortable around.

It makes me feel like im a hypocrite having these ideals but not working towards making real change in the world,  or at least a much as I imagine someone with all the qualities I idealized would have. 

Maybe it's not healthy i think I think too highly of myself,  I get excited thinking about being someone who helps people. It feels narcissistic like I set my sights too high.  But there are times I genuinely get concerned for others and dig so deep looking for the right words that it hurts and leaves me emotionally exasperated until I hear that they are okay,  and devastated when I hear that they did something to harm themselves or worse. I pray in those times. I don't like what Christianity says about that I pray that their souls go to heaven or somewhere that's just the best thing possible or imaginable for an afterlife, I don't get super angry too often but I really hate when people say that people who kill themselves go to hell. I have lost someone close to me that was one of the kindest people I've ever known. I pray that God wouldn't do that to people who are suffering the most. 

Anyways I have been kind of waiting now,  to either suffer a lot more or for wonderful things to happen and trying to just find happiness in the peace that I've found in the meantime. 

I don't know why I wrote this I have been feeling compelled to share something for a while now.  Maybe because I don't feel like I can talk about this stuff to people I know irl, feels like they would judge me negatively,  it even tell me that's wonderful and have a heightened view of me which I don't want.  I'm just a regular guy and i just needed to get this out. 

Love you all. I don't think being schizophrenic makes you crazy but I feel like I am crazy as well as schizophrenic.",3,1

I'm trying to get some advice on navigating this. My S/O recently was released from a hospital stay after a psychosis episode, he is on medicine & I can say everyday is better but he firmly believes that this wasn't a psychosis and he dove too deep and uncovered something he shouldn't have. I guess I just came to get guidance from people who are self aware & have experienced this stuff. How can I be supportive in the best way? We talk a lot about what he feels/believes, I also try and offer my perspective. I'm not sure we have hit a baseline yet, I often wonder if he will ever look back & think 'wow, I can't believe I thought that'. He believes movies/songs are describing what he experienced, that the cia has since been watching him since he uncovered this all. It's not impacting his everyday life, and if wouldn't say anything you wouldn't even know, he his eating & sleeping. He was attending therapy, but has since stopped due to not feeling like he was gaining anything from it..any suggestions/advice/support is appreciated. Thank you.",5,1

When I talk with people, I’ll make eye contact if a want to get a point across, but I hate if somebody’s looking at me, or if I’m in a situation where I’m supposed to look towards their face.


I also personally hate my face. For a while, I thought it might be body dysmorphia, but I can look back at pictures where I was clearly young/thin, and I still generally think my face is weird.

924,13uituj,I need some advice for my best friend,"My best friend’s mom is a diagnosed Schizophrenic and I believe my best friend is as well. I’ve only known her for a year so I’m not sure if she has had any possible symptoms before, but she is displaying quite a few right now, extreme paranoia being the main one. 

She feels that she can’t trust anyone, that everyone is lying to her and out to get her or ruin her relationship. She thinks her partner of 5 years and father of her toddlers is cheating on her or planning on leaving her. If he gets a phone call she thinks it is another woman. If he doesn’t answer his phone while at work she thinks he is cheating. He has to show her his time punches so she knows he’s actually at work and not out cheating. When I mention things they have both told me while around each other she gets suspicious of how I know these things whenever she was there or was the one who told me. She’s accused me of speaking to her partner when she wasn’t around and that I’m trying to convince her he isn’t cheating because he has asked me to, which has never happened. If she gets a text or a phone call from an unknown number she believes it is a woman that her partner is cheating with. She swings from believing whole heartedly that he is cheating on her to saying she knows how much he loves her and that he is a wonderful man and the best future husband she could ever hope for. When she is going on about how she believes everyone is out to get her or that her partner is cheating she is extremely disorganized in her thoughts and it’s hard to get a coherent thought from her. 

She has told me some of the things her mom has called her complaining of and the two main things are, she believes everyone is out to get her and she can’t trust anyone and that her husband is cheating on her. 

My friend also suffers from depression and ADHD and takes medicine for both of them. She is in her early 40’s. As I said, I’ve only known her for a year so I’m unsure if there would’ve been any other symptoms present and quite frankly I’m afraid to ask her partner because every time we’re together she is there and I don’t want her to get upset at me for thinking most of her issues could be from Schizophrenia. I don’t even have his number to ask him in private and he doesn’t have social media. She also expressed to me this evening that she is feeling so out of control and out of it that she just wants to die and wants to feel normal again. 

Does this sound like she could be suffering from Schizophrenia? And if it does, what can I do to get her the help she needs? She is already in personal therapy and couples therapy, but she doesn’t really open up to them because she doesn’t trust them and she thinks they just think she is crazy and need to get over her trust issues. I know you can’t really diagnose anything from the internet, but I’m very concerned for her right now and just want some advice on how to proceed and get her the help she needs. She has young children that are her world and I’d hate to see their world shattered if something were to happen to their mom. I don’t think she is an immediate threat to herself right now or I’d call emergency services, but I believe if something isn’t done soon it might come to that.",3,1

I did however did not feel like i could watch that movie because i felt like the bad guy in the movie who had a demon in him was a direct parallel to people with schizophrenia. You know the whole deal with horror movies by now.

The clip of the movie i commented on was just way too hilarious, they randomly bring up politics in a horror movie!?!?!. i was so shocked to see people commenting how good and profound this scene was. So thats where my initial comment comes from.",4,1

934,13u8y5n,Should I be concerned?,"I believe that humans are allowed to be quirky without having a mental illness slapped on them but I've been having some concerns. 

I used to have minor visual hallucinations as a child , I was fully aware they weren't real and they massively reduced as I got older. 

It wasn't until the last 2 years ish that I now stated having auditory hallucinations  and more visual hallucinations. There not bad or scary just stuff like people screaming my name or asking simple questions. Sometimes it would be a constant chatter in voices I don't recognise.

 The thing is most of them time I know there not real and just ignore it. Usually because I can't see anyone in the room with me or I know the person the voice belongs to is somewhere else. 

I don't have any other symptoms like paranoia. The voices aren't scary or violent they don't make me do stuff or negatively  effect my thoughts. The most annoying thing about them is it makes it hard to listen ( I struggle to hear in general) and hold a convo when 3 other people are having one in your head. 

The visual hallucinations are hard to remember but sometimes there stuff like someone running in front of the car ( I don't drive obviously and can't until I sort this problem out) 

I'm 20 and I still haven't stopped having very violent realistic nightmares but other than that I can't find any other explanation. 

I've been  ignoring it since it started but it's kind of getting tedious now so. 

Any advice opinions on this will be greatly appreciated.",7,1

I quit therapy and medicine after the 4th session (1 session a month) And started taking some sort of naturalbased tranquilizers which made me feel smw better than the meds my therapist has described for me (escitalopram+olanzapine for 2 months then lamictal 2mths) Now its been two months since I quit all of even ( both the tranquilizers and the other meds) And I’ve noticed that my illusions and pseudo hallucinations have gotten worse (I even started answering them back ) And sometimes I feel like that’s it I’m loosing it. I’m trying my best to be in control specially when I’m going through a manic episode But I feel like I’m loosing it. I just came back home after spending 2hours out at a coffee shop , It was lwk crowded and could barely breath LIKE A NORMAL BEING even my hands were shaking and my mind couldn’t stop thinking about all of these thing and contrasting possibilities .

941,13u28jl,My voices won't let me sleep unless I fall in love with him.,"Iv been up for 24 hrs and have severe sleeping patterns. Im currently taking 2medications that are suppose to help me sleep and have worked for me the past 3 years for quieting my voices but I've always had sleeping problems such as I wake up at 9:30 a.m. and go to bed around 7:00 p.m. but toss and turn and don't sleep until around midnight to 4:00 a.m.. yesterday I took melatonin and I haven't taken that for a month and I took 20 mg and it did nothing for me. 

So I just met this new guy about a month ago met him at the grocery store. We exchanged phone numbers and have been talking for a month straight so I went over to his house he cooked me dinner we talked all night long then we had sex. My voices wouldn't let me sleep next to him. Next week we did the same thing again and the same thing happened again they wouldn't let me sleep again. I didn't know how to explain to my partner that my voices aren't letting me sleep so I couldn't tell him why I wasn't sleeping, I hope he doesn't think that I'm on drugs. Another week has went by and I couldn't sleep for a while maybe got 4 hours of sleep a day for 3 or 4 days in a row. My voices now won't let me sleep unless I Fall in Love with them. And some of my other posts I have posted where I said I have fallen in love with my voice well I've gotten into a situation where I no longer find that healthy anymore and want to meet people outside of my head. They don't want me moving on and won't let me move on and force me to see images of him in my head. I want this to stop. I noticed every time I wake up in the morning I need to look at my voices social media and I have to force myself not to look at it and I have to tell myself no but I feel like I'm fighting an addiction maybe worse because I feel like I almost have no choice. As the day goes by I noticed that I really don't like this person that's in my head because of their personality and what I have found out about them in real life and I have been feeling this way for the past 4 months now and every day I tell myself that I don't like this person and I feel that way. I go to bed hating this person and just want to move on but my voices force me to fall back in love with this person in order to fall asleep. Sometimes I just go to bed without falling in love with this person but when I wake up I noticed that I'm back in love with this person again. But later in the day I go back to hating this person again.",4,1
942,13tmt0l,Fear that suicide is my destiny,"As a kid I would get this sick feeling in my gut that I would die before 30 yrs old. I'm 24 now and it just seems like I'm getting to the end.

I really don't know what to do. I'm scared because my disability claim got denied initially. I will probably have to go before a judge. My meds make me too tired to work but if I go off them I get unstable. I refuse to be homeless. If I have to pick between suicide and homelessness I think I will choose suicide.

It will probably take close to 2 years from now to get a hearing. I'm afraid that these are my last couple years on earth. I heard a voice whisper above head ""come home"" when I was thinking about suicide.

It feels like the Divine is preparing me for my death. Like it is my destiny or purpose to suicide.
I survived an attempt in 2017 and I thought it would never happen again. I thought I defeated suicide once and for all...

 Then psychosis happened and here I am full circle. I hate to say that it feels inevitable. I feel like a walking suicide.

Maybe some miracle will happen where the meds stop making me tired and I can work. Or maybe some miracle where I don't need to take them anymore. Maybe I will find favor before a judge.

947,13tu7fn,Does anyone ever believe that what is happening on TV is real?,"I have a friend going through a very hard time and he is adopting some extreme beliefs as a response to trauma. He is currently feeling very depressed.

He has exhibited other behavioral disturbances, such as impulsively stealing small items, committing small acts of vandalism towards people's property, such as keying cars or mailboxes at random, hitting traffic cones with his car while speeding, etc. He's told me that one day this week, he got caught keying someone's mailbox, then started yelling and laughing at them, then sped away in his car. I haven't witnessed it myself, but he's described sometimes starting arguments and randomly insulting people, then he says he starts laughing and runs away.

As of late he described to me one night about how sometimes, he'll watch TV or cartoons and will fully believe that they are real and that the places in them are actual places in the real world he could go to and meet people. Like, he has stated that he feels like he could literally meet cartoon characters. When he acts like what I've listed, he says he feels disconnected from his body and that he is simply a passenger in his body, his body choosing to do and believe these things without his actual input, as if it was a machine he had no control over. He states he feels very paranoid when this happens, and that his past love interests have been plotting against him to make him act like this, so that he will be arrested or killed by the police.

I am currently trying to convince him to check into a hospital as he's becoming more erratic. He is open to the idea but he seems afraid of doing so. Petitioning for a commitment is on the table as he is getting worse and I'm very worried for him. I am not looking for a diagnosis but I'm wondering if other people here have experienced similar symptoms. I have a diagnosis, and I'm trying to see how I can frame things for him to help support him, in respect to what he may be suffering from.

955,13tsdy1,Coparent with schizoaffective and I’m confused,"I apologize in advance as this is going to be very long. When I was pregnant with my son, his dad had to go to the psych ward because he went to a party and he was convinced someone stabbed him him in the neck with a needle to poison him…he went to the ER and they suggested he check into a psych ward to be assessed. He was just diagnosed with alcohol dependency, anxiety. Depression but didn’t share a lot of his paranoias with them. He got out and was on a myriad of medicine. One evening, he took a bunch of pills and drank like half a fifth - he was acting really erratic. He pushed me and grabbed me by the neck and his friends asked me to take him somewhere else because of the way he was acting. He passed out and woke up in my car yelling that I was trying to kidnap him and was trying to steer my car off the road and unbuckle himself and threaten to jump. Things progressed and he always thought there was s white truck following him, that a terrorist used to own his cell phone and the FBI was after him, that he bought a toolbox where someone has murdered someone with a tool from it and the cops thought it was him, that my family was hacking into his electronics ETC. 

He wasn’t really around after the baby was born. Eventually he got his diagnosis after one time he stole his stepdads bike and tried to drive it to Mexico with a burner phone because people were after him. After that particular situation and him being gone for so long / knowing clearly something was going on I said I wouldn’t send my son out there but he could visit him at my home or we could meet places. Eventually his mom reaches out after months and asked to meet. She begrudgingly notified me of his schizoaffective diagnosis and accused me of discriminating against him. We decided that he could still go visit as long as when he was there someone else was also home. This worked for awhile until one night I went to pick him up and he wasn’t home. His mom ( sons grandma ) was at the bar and she left my son alone with his dad and he took off and nobody could find him. I ended up having to call the sheriff and eventually he returned after multiple hours in the middle of the night. My son was crying and confused ( he was 5) and he said he don’t eaten or drank anything all day- he has him in multiple layers of clothes with the heater on and he was very hot. My son said his dad told him people were after them and following them in the creek in the woods and they were up there selling firewood…it was the middle of fall in oregon in the rain. After this they told all their family I was exaggerating ..I didn’t show up to her my son and so he has to take him to run errands.

Fast forward and he has gone off his meds multiple times but I’m always kept in the dark about it. Once he showed up to my home on drugs running from someone who had just been with him and robbed a store. My son is almost 10 now and he made the big decision to go on vacation with his dad and his grandparents for spring break to AZ. Last minute this destination is changed to vegas and I’m very worried. My son called me crying day three FaceTimed me and his dad was drunk passed out on the couch holding his beer. He binge drank for three days straight and terrified my son. One evening he didn’t come back to the room and the next day the family was out and he FaceTimed them from the room with a random man he met on the streets that was showing him around he says. My son said the guy looked really scary and he was worried about his dad and the decisions he was making. My son has not seen his dad since the vacation two months ago because it’s spiraled into a big situation. Today I tried to speak to him to understand what’s going on and eventually he told me he hasn’t been on his schizoaffective meds for two years and he blames the therapist for diagnosing him incorrectly when he was just in a what he says psychosis from being on Ritalin for so long- he says he is managing fine and I don’t know what to believe about everything? I tried to convince him to attend a therapy session with my son but he thinks the therapist is out to get him and prove him unfit / ruin his relationship with his son and he doesn’t want my “ drama.” Does anybody have opinions  on this situation or advice ?",4,1

( I just want to also say, I wasn't aware that anything I'm about to type down wasn't normal or real until about 2019 when I was in college and my classmates were very confused on what I was saying / doing / looking at / interacting with.

Daily Basis.

\- Cat that follows me around ( Has been following me around since I was about 13 to 14 - I'm now 21 for clarification ) - Been told this is a ""protective factor"" that my brain has created(?)

\- Notification noises but there's no notification.

\- Phone buzzing, but nothing coming through on phone.

\- People talking but very muffled, I refer to it like it's a radio that somebody's put on in another room, I cannot hear what the people are saying, but they're speaking to each other like they're doing an interview of some sort. - This goes away when I put music on, Or I'm overall distracted.

Bad Days.

\- Feel like the world isn't real and that my mind is making up what I am seeing, My mind tells me that the things I'm looking at are in fact rocks and pieces of wood and sand and that I'm the only human on the planet and that it's made everything that I'm interacting with up because it cant come to terms with the fact that the world ended years ago and I'm the only one alive.

\- Time goes by very quickly and I feel like I move too slowly.

\- Harsh voices that I don't really recognise telling me not to eat.

\- Random movements in the corner of my eyes.

\- The walls look like they are breathing.

Anomalies.

\- I've got a new snail friend that shows up sometimes and sits on the ceiling in my room.

\- Smell of rotting things - I normally say rotting meat, but I don't specifically know what that smells like, but that smell is what I imagine it to smell like.

\- Burning Smell - not very often, I got sent to the hospital for an MRI and an EEG scan but they found nothing to indicate that I had epilepsy.

\- Stuff changes In games for me.

And while I'm feeling like this, all my thoughts are about a central delusion and I feel like I'm being controlled by this central delusion: like I'm a robot because I'm a machine made to operate out this delusion's will.

But I discovered that alcohol makes me avoid this feeling. It also is expensive and makes me feel like shit later on. So, there have been nights that I've been drinking excessively just to avoid feeling like a robot. It's just nice to be able to laugh if I want to, or something. But I don't think it's worth it.

And the icing on the cake is she told me there’s a chance this new medication can alter my antipsychotics and cause my symptoms to get worse 🙃 I talked to a different doctor about something unrelated, and he became concerned that I might go through acute psychosis soon and was asking me if I’m trying anything to prevent that.

974,13tpol9,Please help me get through this,"My sister is 30 and was just diagnosed with schizophrenia. My family and I always thought she suffered from depression and anxiety but she never sought help and when we tried to intervene she refused and would always do something that showed she was getting help on her own such as going to a therapist whenever we begged her. Other than that she functioned normally (or pretended to at least).

She went through a psychotic break two weeks ago and had to go to the hospital in which she finally went to psychiatric care. When we found out her diagnosis it was a shock and now none of us really know how to help her. Schizophrenia doesn’t run in our family so this is really new to us and we are trying to do our best to help her with the voices in her head she talks about.

She was recently discharged with medicine for her thyroid problems, zoloft, and risperidone. It’s only been three days but every night she still starts to hear voices around 5pm and at 8pm is when she begins to lash out and believes people are talking bad about her or lying to her. These voices are always negative. 

Please give me some advice I can give to my family. I live three thousand miles away so it’s hard knowing that I have no answers for them. I am trying to see if I can contact the doctor personally about her medicine. 

In your experiences how long before your medicine started to work? With medicine do you still hear voices in your head? Do they stay negative or do they ever become positive? What is the best approach to someone who believes everyone around them is lying? 

Any and all advice or even personal stories can help and will be appreciated. I am just trying to make sense of all this so I can better help my sister.",1,1

I share a wall with my neighbour and sometimes we hear each other. However, I hear my neighbour complaining about me.   
Unfortunately, I suffer from depression and low mood - I sometimes can get somewhat anxious and scared even at home, and I react by trying to be quiet and speaking as quietly as possible. But this doesn't work!! My neighbours then, in turn, think that because im timid/quiet I Im acting like that because they think that, I, think like they (neighbours) are spying on me.    
For the record, I dont think that my neighbours are spying or listening to my conversations but I do suffer from low self-esteem and depression so when I do talk I get nervous about receiving criticism about my annoying sounding voice.   
Its energy-sapping, having to tiptoe around my house just because Im living next door to neighbours who dont like me. I'm already depressed but it feels like being kicked when im down.  Im too poor to move but wish I could.

989,13tc13u,What’s going in with me!," 


It all started when I was 5 years old. I remember very little from my childhood, but I remember seeing a white man standing in our kitchen. He would always be there whenever I woke up at night and he would be bright white all of him would be bright white. I told my mom about it at the time and she moved a mirrored that reflected tot he kitchen which was where I was seeing him through. But I remember when she moved the mirrored that night I peaked through the wall and he was still there. He would always be there. I grew up and never really paid much attention anymore. Until my freshman year of high school. I went through something semi traumatic. My mom started getting numerous tumors and surgeries on her uterus until she eventually had it taken out completely. The way they made it seem was it was cancer, and she was gonna die, and she had to go to Mexico to get her procedure done so I felt like I was never gonna see my mom again because I couldn’t leave the Country or else I wouldn’t be able to cross back. So I was by myself for 2 months, my dad stayed back with me but he would work 6-6 at the time to be able to afford her surgery in mexico. So I would come home and just read books. But then I remember hearing things like other people talking to me and voices in my head. I thought it was the narrative from the book, I tried to dismiss it but I was by myself. Sometimes they would tell me to walk and walk and walk, and I would. I would leave my house and just walk until they would tell me to stop and then whenever they would say stop I would sit on the floor and cry for 30 minutes and then I would walk back home. And that kept happening, until I started not doing the things they said because I would think I would get kidnapped. I never mentioned it to my parents because I felt like they were already going through a lot. My mom turned out fine, her tumors were benign and she was on the road to recovery but I felt stuck in that depressive/hearing things cycle. My whole personality changed. I mentioned it to my parents and they took me to see someone but they only drugged tested me and dismissed what I was going through. I am the oldest so and i felt/feel like I shouldn’t need help. My parents always told me I could do it myself, I was strong and independent but I didn’t feel that way. Well i kept having episodes and just blacking out and not remembering anything, if hearing things, and seeing people, seeing shadows. I reached out to see a psychiatrist on my own when I was 23 and he dismissed me when I told him my symptoms, he said it must be part of my culture. Now I’m 25 seeking help again with a different psychiatrist cause I feel like the voices and seeing things are back full force. But he said maybe I just have a sixth sense because the way I describe things doesn’t sound like schizophrenia. I told him I see people now, that I don’t only see shadows which was the only thing I would see before. Now I see faces, and hair color, and men and women, I hear children, I hear my name being called out, I hear screams, I hear a man telling me that my mom is not my mom anymore, that my husband is lying to me, that I shouldn’t trust anyone around me. I like to go into hiding in a dark place and sometimes it makes me feel better but I feel like I have no control over what’s going on and I have no idea what’s wrong with me.",2,1
990,13sydon,Parents not taking my illness seriously.,"Leaving a trigger warning because I mention suicide/my diagnosis being denied.

I have had a horrendous month and a half completely engulfed in delusions, hallucinations, and as a result I've been in a pretty catatonic state. Have gone days without eating and have overall been pushing others away, lashing out at people who probably do not deserve it. I reached out to my ex who decided to talk to my parents about the symptoms I've been having (feels like people are out to get me, I have been talking to people that aren't there, I always feel watched, I can't tell what is real, I've hallucinated entire text conversations.) She also brought up the fact that I attempted to overdose on pills about 4 weeks ago. My mom assumed she was trying to get into my head, and my dad straight up told me I shouldn't believe my psychiatrist's diagnosis for me, and that I'm totally normal. I even tried to reassure them what my ex said was true, but it's like they ignored me.

A lot of my friends or people who want to help me live far away. My parents are not being as supportive as I need. I know I am in a terrible mental state, but I'm not sure what to do. I'm very frustrated, because if I was being taken more seriously, I would get the help I need. I am afraid I'm going to end up hurting myself again or continue to dig myself into a very deep hole as a result of mania or psychosis or whatever I am going through.

If your disease is “neurodegenerative”, do you have a hope in hell of completing studies or getting a highly paid job?

I have a paranoia because I had food poisoning a few days ago and was low on energy and basically couldn’t think at most points during the day for many days including this one. On the first day I couldn’t speak temporarily, and I was making nonsense in my head, and if I didn’t rest, my thoughts became more disorganised. It was a state of confusion. On later days and other times for the duration of my symptoms it would have become word salad if I didn’t shut up and go to my room to rest, and I had some very strange ideas, including nonsense. My paranoia extends dramatically. Essentially, I had gained a disability after the food poisoning.

I have problems, including mind control issues (I have to unpack this but I don’t trust anyone, not even my therapist).

I am currently still recovering from the food poisoning. My body is weak. I was out of breath after walking down one floor of stairs, which I usually run down. I was out of breath after moving to another room. My chest felt heavy. I felt bloated after eating most foods. The symptoms are detailed in another post.

Lastly, I’d like to make a survey. How many of you work, and what sector are you in?

Edit: I forgot to put the “Results” section in the poll. Please vote Primary sector if you want to see the results, as I’m generally after a poll to see how many people are doing things like STEM or programming etc. If you are genuinely in the primary sector, do tell me in the comments.

998,uahgbq,Schizophrenic child harmed their siblings,"So this is a bit of a doozy that I am still processing as it all happened yesterday. My child (11/FTM/Charlie) had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia symptoms about 6 months ago, we learned that they had been suffering from it since they were 6 years old but the symptoms were mostly either taken as just being a kid (hallucinations) or they were straight up not mentioned to us as parents. I suspect that he has been living with this for even longer, and took everything as normal? I really don't know. We got him into therapy and he was put on some mild medication and he was really starting to do and feel a lot better, not that he was ever particularly bad in the first place (some mild paranoia and voices which he would explain to us and journal about). He was hanging out with his siblings a lot more, baking, socializing, making friends etc etc. Everything was really well for him and he looked like he was doing fine. 

He has had no history of violence or noted trauma as we are a very loving house hold, everyone tells each other we love them, hugs all around, we treat each other with respect, and the only punishment ever dolled out is being sent to your room or losing electronics. He has never talked about harming anyone, and has never acted on any sort of urges or impulses. He has always been a really great kid that gets good grades, never gets in trouble, and is so kind. 

When I woke up yesterday morning, it was too him coming upstairs and telling us (both parents) that he had a knife because he was paranoid and slipped and fell and accidentally cut his siblings. Obviously that was a bit of a red flag but we took him at his word and went downstairs where we discovered both of Charlie's siblings were stabbed multiple times. The worst of which was the youngest sibling (7) who had a 2 inch deep stab wound in the back of the head. All together were counted 8 or so stab wounds between the two of them. My partner took the youngest to the ER as the head wound was obviously something that needed to be treated right away (youngest kid is fine now a couple of staples) while I watched the older two. I obviously felt like this was not an accident but could not really understand at all, so I asked Charlie what had happened. He took his computer and started typing, and when I interrupted him and demanded an answer and took the laptop he had written out a confessional and verbally told me they had planned this since they were 9 years old and intentionally stabbed his siblings. He admitted he was going to kill both of them, and then his parents, and then order weapons on amazon for school. Obviously I was in shock, I had called emergency services and told them what was told to me. Our middle child went via ambulance to a hospital, and I rode with Charlie in an ambulance to the psychiatric hospital for evaluation. He was so cold when interacting with the officers and any questions regarding it. He said he planned it and wanted to do the school thing because it ""sounded fun"". 

&#x200B;

It is the following day now and I am still in utter shock. I have no idea what to do, what to say, what to think. I have comforted the two younger kids and they are okay, but I don't think they really absorbed what happened. It's the weekend so I won't have much answers from the hospital Charlie is at until Monday. So many things are running through my head and I am trying to stay focused, but there are so many what could have been scenarios. I wish I knew where this came from. I have no idea what will happen in the near future, and I am scared to death of his future release and what that will mean. I miss Charlie so much, and I love him because he is still my child and I think about him every hour of the day, but I am also so scared for my other kids and for his own future.

1016,an787e,Why has this sub turned into a selfie exhibition?,"I am rather disgruntled to see that lately the quality of posts on this subreddit have been gradually decreasing. By that I mean that most people are posting off-topic pictures by the dozens. First, it started with art/paintings, which although slightly off-topic, are easy to appreciate in the context of schizophrenia/mental illness, but the level of off-topic posts that I've started seeing has become rather alarming. 
 
Although Reddit has a perfectly suitable r/selfies subreddit, many people have started posting their selfies on here without giving much of a constructive value to their posts in any other way. I get that some might feel more at home at here because of their diagnosis of mental illness/Schizophrenia, but I don't think this gives them the right to flood the entire subreddit with pictures of themselves. 
 
If I have bipolar disorder, or I'm a gamer, or I like astrophysics, or have whatever quality that defines me in some way, does that mean that I should post pictures of my face on these topics' respective subreddits just because someone else thought that this would be a good thing to do? 

I realize that some people may feel encouragement from the replies they get on their selfies on here, but that still does not deter us from the fact that actual constructive discussions that should be getting more attention in this sub are pushed to the side by non-constructive selfie posts. 
 
As a member of this subreddit and someone with this same diagnosis, can I please ask all of you to pay attention to the quality of the content that you'll be posting on here in the future? We should strive to build this community on proper shared moral values and rationale in understanding, discussing and reaching certain conclusions about schizophrenia/mental illness in a constructive way. By flooding the sub with off-topic pictures, unfortunately that is not going to lead us to any sort of progress.  
 
Thanks for reading and I hope to see more quality content on here in the future!

1021,2uptl4,My little brother has paranoid schizophrenia and I hate him for it,"Before I begin, I want to say I love him very much and have had a couple of amazingly intense relationships with people with schizophrenia throughout my life. So I mean no ill will toward anyone, but i hate my brother for the monster he has become.

We are both in our 30's now and we were best friends when we wee kids. We would play games like crash up derby with hot wheels and a favorite was one where he had a stuffed animal named Etone and we would make up silly stories about him and I would make Etone talk. It was silly, but we loved it and I miss my brother very much. The man I see now looks like him, but Ive almost accepted he is gone, and there is a shell pretending to be him. Its the only way I can cope anymore. 

Until he was diagnosed at 0, he was a really good guy. You know the type that would give the shirt off his back and actually he was a bit of a pushover, but a good guy nonetheless. But then he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and the medication he was on was good for about 5 years, but then it stopped working. Everything has been bad since then.

He has been in and out of jail since then. Last time he went because he wanted to see what the inside of our other brother looked like, so he tried chasing him with a knife. Luckily for them both a cop was driving by and took him to jail. He is just getting worse and he lives with our mom. She confided in me recently she sleeps with her bedroom door locked because she is scared of him. She will be 60 next year. I want him gone, but she refuses to listen to anyone and Im scared of what he will do next. 

I dont really expect an answer, and Im not trying to discourage anyone here. But I tried, I really did but he doesnt want help and I hate him for it. My brother is gone and I hate him for leaving.

I am fundamentally against psychiatry. The basis on which it was founded is unimaginably racist, sexist, classist bullshit designed to push guilt and shame for not being a perfect little slave for the capitalist hell we live in.
We are all made to feel like something is wrong with us, like we need to be 'fixed', when what we really need is a society that cares about people instead of profit.

That being said, there is nothing I can do about the world we live in. There is no escape, there is not big change that will free us. And in order for me to survive in this world, I need to do things that I don't want to. I need to play into their idea of what ""wellness"" is.
If I am going to stay alive, I need to be able to support myself. I need a place to live and food to eat. And in order to have those things I need to have a job. But I can't work!

I am asking this question because I have been having experiences with weed that I have never heard of happening before. 

I am posting this question here because schizophrenia is my biggest fear when it comes to my weed use, and because I do not know much about my family history on my mothers side which worries me because she struggled a lot with pretty severe unidentified mental illness.

Experiences that worry me:
1. While I am on weed, if and only if I have been smoking daily for a while (2+ weeks) and have built a moderate tolerance, I will get a feeling of pressure in my head (mostly behind my forehead and on the top of my head). This pressure ranges from slightly uncomfortable all the way to searing sharp pain depending on how much I smoke. I should note that if I have not been smoking recently and do not have a tolerance, I don’t get the feeling at all no matter how much I smoke in one session. The feeling will fade over the course of 24-48 hours. 

2. I have recently noticed changes in my mood that are subtle but noticeable. I have become both more apathetic and anhedonic in the past few weeks. I have struggled with these things growing up, but usually there is some kind of specific trigger and it gets better as I change my environment and mindset. This time there is no clear trigger or sign of improvement.

3. I haven’t started hearing things necessarily, but I’ve noticed an increased tendency to mishear sounds. I will hear a backpack zipper moving and perceive it as someone saying “Hey”, before thinking for a second and realizing what it really was. 

I am mostly concerned about #1, which is why Id like to ask this subreddit if any of you have had a similar experience with weed. Additionally, what differences in the effects of weed have you noticed in yourself that your non schizophrenic peers don’t seem to get?",1,1

1035,8y006z,A story about how rare schizophrenia actually is.,"Hi every one i used to post on this thread a year or two ago when I was convinced I had schizophrenia. I have come back to this thread  becase A.  I have a few minutes of free time at work right now and B. I want people who are writing on this thread to realize theres an extremely high chance you dont have schizophrenia by telling my absurdly ridiclous story about my schizophrenia diagnosis. 

Lets begin:

When I was a teenager I became depressed because of the very stressful divorce of my parents and some intense bullying I experinced in High School. During this time I began using Marijuana as well. My depression and my Marijuana use continued through out my  College years at some points I was sucicidal but merely in thought. I never actually believed I would go through with it. It was during my Junior Year of college where I finally snapped and began having psychotic symptoms. I dont belive I have to go into to much detial because im sure you are all familiar with these psychotic symptoms, but one Symptom i would like to mention is hallucinations which when I was sent to the Doctor and they said I had a case of Schizophernia and many doctors and my mom where convinced that I had schizophrenia. The only one who was in did not believe i had Schizophrenia was my Father and I wish i had listened to him instead of the Doctors and my Mother. Now this is where it gets intresting you may know thoughts of grandosity and delusions are a common symptom of Schizophrenia. I will not get to specfics about my so called thoughts of grandosity and delusions becuase they turned out to be real and not in my mind and its simply to complicated to explain to people who do not know me, but I actually was hallucinating so i acutally did need a little help but its not as severe as the doctors beleived it to be because as mentioned before my thoughts of grandosity and delusions turned out they where not delusions at all but in fact reality. However, when I started having these thoughts many people thought I was crazy and many people  belived the thoughts I was having becuase to them it actually made perfect sense, but at the time i was not sure if  the thoughts that I was having about my self where true or not which in combination with half the students and teachers telling me I was crazy while the other half beleived what I was saying drove me into this mental break down where I started having hallucinations and going completly psycho. These thoughts I was having , which turned out to be true, where the primary reason I was bullied so intenesly through out high school many people from my High school knew what happened to me and that when I was having a mental break down it was not as bad as it seemed, but could do nothing becuase it is simply to complicated to explain to outsiders such as doctors and my mother. My Father knew the whole time who I was but choose not to tell me becuase he thought I woudlnt be able to handle the truth especially during high school and because of my instability i college. As im sure most of you can know see why I had a complete mental break down in College and was labaled Schizophrenic it was because of the lack of knowledge  I had about my self and when I began to find out who I was and what had happened to me not a single person who knew me told me the Truth instead they decided to not tell me and Bully me becuase they where jelous about who I was, and then I was in college and started to have these thoughts and began to truly find out who I was nobody in college believed me because they did not grow up with me so they did know any thing they either beleived it or thought I was psyhco which ultimatly resulted in me actually going Psycho and Hallucinating. Now after a Year and Half of being on those bullshit antipsychotics and thinking i had a severe case of Schizophrenia the whole time, I am med free and a prefectly healthy adult. 

The Moral of the Story: I hope alot of people who use this thread read this story because things may not be as bad as they seem and thats the lesson of my story.  I believe that the vast majority of the People using this thread really are not Schizophrenic but theres something not understood about the individual which is causing them to have these psycotic symptoms such as frequent Marijuana use (which was probably part of the reason I started hallucinating), a history of trama and stress which has not been explored or explained why these things happened ( after my trama and stress was explained I became Healthy almost immediatly), and lack of knowing the pantient ( which is why doctors gave me a diagnosis of schizophrenia). Therefore I urge all of you expreincing psychotic symptoms to re-evauluate and realize you may really not have schizophernia. Find a therapist in your community not one who has no idea about the enviroment you grew up in becuase how are they suppsoed to believe you when you start telling them crazy shit! and please also realize that substiance abuse can also be a root cause of psyhotics symptoms and with a few months of treatment you will be a healthy as a horse. And once you understand more about your self and the enviroment around you, wou will realize that you are not schizophrenic but merely you and the your loved ones just have mistunderstood you or you are simply using drugs to often and your genetics cant handle it.

1036,4be5wp,Help. Please Read. Is this schizophrenia?," Two years ago, i went to a community college to apply for classes. I filled out my app, did everything the right way, then the year after that, i started feeling pressure in my head and hearing voices telling me that i have several months to live. 

""Tymisinfinity, you have 5 months to live, Tymisinfinity, you have 10 days to die""
 
It felt like i had a bomb in my head. If i sat still for long enough, it would feel as if my head was about to explode. Then after that, whatever it was made me get up and jog around my neighborhood. After i got home it started playing some sort of game with me. ""At 12 o'clock we will strike"" and, ""The bible is not safe"". It wouldn't let me sit still, and i felt as if these demonic entities were breathing on my skin and following me around my house.The voices wouldnt stop until i got closer to a hospital. The voices have told me that me and whole family have been CIA and NSA mindslaves of some sort for some secret purpose...a CIA and NSA of another dimension of some sort. Supposedly another planet.  Apparently theres some alien race up there thats in control of all of us or something. It made me imagine being in the mob or mafia/some sort of criminal secret society that wears suits and carries silver mossberg 500 tacticals with there names engraved into one side of them. All while just sitting there and staring at a picture of one. Before this i saw someone in a beige suit run past the window to my room. i was in my mothers room and i fell asleep. When i woke up i thought i was dead or something. These voices told me things that made me remember some things from my childhood and my life while i was in school in general, and lo and behold, i've realized i've been mind controlled my whole entire life. They told that i was used for porn when i was in elementary school via pictures through my eyes.  Everything that has happened up to this point and most likely even past this point is for someone else sinister reason. Just thinking about the reasoning of the entity in control of me during those years just seems incredibly hard to wrap my mind around. Either way it goes, the conclusion i've reached is something extremely negative, much more negative than failure socially and academically. I cant sleep without seeing strange faces popping up within the darkness of my eyelids. Still hearing the voices. The medications don't work. They've told me im going to be a billionare that invents warp drive technology. A year later now, and im still hearing the same pattern and its just simply ""think about being a rapper/producer that gets out of the industry and becomes a billionare that invents bulletproof shirts, cloaking technology, and warp drive technology/floating cars"" and what not.

1045,4k5llj,Why is schizophrenia the default explanation? Why aren't beliefs valued?,"We live in a complex universe, with competing points of view. I believe labeling the symptoms of schizophrenia as a medical condition to be reductionist and disingenuous. Humans have believed in spirits since before religion was established, and religions continue to be highly organized. Mental health is a belief system and state of mind.

Something that is inexplicable, grandiose, or esoteric is not automatically a delusion. Under the right conditions, we can observe fantasies such as telepathy or time travel. Speculation about parallel universes and other enigma is prominent in astrophysics. It is a well-known fact that humans only perceive a small portion of the energy (electromagnetic spectrum) present in the universe. 

Schizophrenia is an explanation that leads to problems. You can't prove if someone is mentally ill, but the treatment is known to damage the brain. It can't be proven that antipsychotics work better than placebo or therapy. Taking treatment means you are more likely to relapse long-term. The concept also brings huge consequences to our culture - it affects more than the afflicted individuals.

I want to understand the motivation for labeling a person (myself) as fundamentally flawed on a biological level without strong reasons. Why would it be unreasonable to suggest that I take antipsychotics merely to appease a demon that has control over my soul? How do we know the curse is in the mind, and not in the translation of peers and practitioners?

1047,2592r8,A new name for schizophrenia (excluding catatonia),"I know a little bit about disease in general, specifically this one, and I must say, the 1800's theory that was passed down for years and years has failed to accurately capture the essence of this disease. Catanic schizophrenia is indeed an trifling matter, but if you are posting on reddit then clearly you have a different illness. This is why I would like for the other 4 types of ""schizophrenia"" to be re categorized into names that are as fitting as 'depression' is for its respective ailment. 

The first thing that popped into my head was the ""grey complex"", which seems like an excellently descriptive name. It describes the root symptom with a bit of artistic flair.

There are two ways of looking at diseases like this. One, which I believe to be more popular, is the theory that there is some ""wound"", some specific event which causes this disease to manifest. Then, there is the theory that it is simply a habit/ behavior, which is the theory that I like more. This, however, brings us to a dead end when we tell the person with the disease that by changing their behavior, they can be cured.

I just noticed I cannot advise treatment, so I will leave you with this

5.) Don't take drugs at any cost, it worsens the episode big time.  
6.) Search friends who have same diagnisis, BUT are taking good care of there illness, don't make friends who take drugs and have schizo, not good.  
7.) Don't always trust your doctor, mostly they also dont know what is right for you, you need to get your own expert of schizo and meds. Read and learn about schizo and medicamtion.  
8.) Always have meds with you. Put some extra pills into your jacket pocket.  
9.) Dont drink too much alcohol, it dissolves the meds in your blood.  
10.) Dont do experimations with meds, drugs, CBD etc.

Sometimes I have the confidence to change the narrative of the music I hear or even sometimes turn it off.  I also have visual hallucinations when I close my eyes, these are very basic like rotating lines.  If remain calm and don't act, the lines won't move but the moment I start thinking about it they will rotate.  Even if they start rotating, I am able to control which way they rotate, how many there are and their speed.

Now that being said, can schizophrenics with full blown human visual hallucinations change what they see.  I'm wondering if it would be like a lucid dream scenario where you can have influence over the characters and environment you see.  Looking past and controlling the emotion, fear and anxiety, is it possible?

This went on for about 3ish years of extreme hallucinations and what not. They would get strongest when I was alone, usually at night. They would be subtle in the day time but would have a few really triggering ones. At night is when it would get to be the worst, and ""they"" claim it was because they didn't want anyone to know they existed. They didn't want to be taken away from my body. It is a group of 8 beings who all sit in my head and control me. They would take advantage of me and make my body do what they wanted while I could only watch through my eyes like a window. Along with them, I also saw 5 visual hallucinations in my room at all times. Different beings and entities that all had different feelings and auras. There was only one I really liked and I do miss her a lot, she had a motherly energy to her. I also had 2 with me when I was driving. One In my backseat and one on the side of the road watching. I also always saw the walls and floors move, like they were breathing. They still do that. Recently it has been seeing every object and floor and walls look lkke they are constantly moving, constantly vibrating with color coming off of them. I don't see the others much anymore since I moved but the control panel sometimes show up, they get mad when I tell the internet about them and they'll punish me.

1084,oz766p,"[Mod Approved, Academic Survey] Reasons to play video games for people with schizophrenia (Inclusion: 18+, read and write in English, diagnosis or awaiting diagnosis of schizophrenia)","Hello All!

I hope everyone is doing well!

I am a researcher at Bath Spa University investigating gaming habits in people who are currently living with schizophrenia.

I’m currently looking for people who have (or are awaiting) a diagnosis of schizophrenia to complete a survey around gaming habits. The survey itself focuses on what motivates you to engage with games, as well as asking about the types of games you play the most. This includes gaming format (whether you prefer consoles, mobile, PC etc) and genre. Your information will be collated and used to determine the games and motivations that are most popular and the most common.

All survey responses will be confidential. You will be asked to provide an email address in case I need to contact you at any point, but this will be the only other piece of personal information needed.

I’m hoping to use this information to get a better idea of the most common reasons people play games. Once that’s clear then I will use the survey results to run more in-depth video interviews with gamers who have schizophrenia. I can’t currently confirm the exact content of the interview questions (beyond a discussion about what games mean to you) and it is likely that the study will evolve based on the answers received (that’s partly what this survey is for) but if taking part is something that you may be interested in then please let me know at the end of the survey.

To take part follow this link: [https://bathspa.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/exploring-the-gaming-habits-of-people-with-schizophrenia](https://bathspa.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/exploring-the-gaming-habits-of-people-with-schizophrenia)

For more context i live in an apartment complex where there are three floors, and a hallway leading to four apartments on each floor. There is ALWAYS a hallway door slamming whenever someone knocks on mine or my neighbors' doors. Today... NO SLAMMING.

And then i tried to call my grandfather who, in my currently mentally ill brain, wouldn't answer. And also, in my brain, his cell phone would just hang up without even a voicemail. Then he answered his landline and it disconnected. I shut my phone off and turned it on again. Then the landline and cell phone both shut off. Then i talk to my grandfather and it disconnects. I try to call his cell phone, but of course, it hangs up with no voice box. Then i call his landline again and we talk and i tell him what i saw. He says to call his cell and of course, there are dialtones and he actually picks up.

During the course of me fearing it was finally happening, i threw various items and kicked one of my cans.

The industry of psychiatry mistakenly believes that schizophrenia is caused by genetic factors that result in examples of abnormal physiology like chemical imbalance or abnormal morphology of the brain, but the truth is that schizophrenia, without exception, is caused by psychological trauma. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia seven years ago, and I've discovered through my own investigation in the meantime of then and now that schizophrenics, again without exception, are those in society who have suffered the worst psychological trauma both within and outside of their dysfunctional families which is where most of the psychological trauma takes place. There's related information and discussion on the Discord-server that, in my opinion, outright proves that schizophrenia is caused by psychological trauma, not genetic factors.

The good news is that this means that schizophrenia can be treated successfully with competent psychotherapy. If you'd like to know more about this or discuss this subject further, the link is: [https://discord.gg/3cGvAMF](https://discord.gg/3cGvAMF)",0,1
1096,8tmmjz,Does this seem like I have schizophrenia of some sort?,"Before I write anything, I wanna say that I tend to smoke weed regularly. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but lately I've noticed that my behavior is getting weird. For the last 2 weeks I've been smoking once a day, everyday (always at night). Before that I used to smoke mostly only on the weekends because of school but now since it's summer vacation I'm freed up to smoke a lot more.

I wanna start off with this: for some reason I think a painting behind me is possessed by a demon and is constantly looking at me, but at the same time I think it isn't real and I'm just making it up. Also, I like watching the TV Sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"". This is where it gets really weird for me. I feel like all the characters in the show represent a part of my personality. It also seems to me like the show has some subtle lines that make me think about stuff... Like as they're saying their lines, I feel as if they're talking directly about me. 

Lately in social situations, I've been feeling really apathetic.  It's like I don't care about anything anymore. Sometimes I feel empty. My friends have asked me questions like ""Why are you so emotionless?"" and ""You look like a zombie"". At the time when this happened I didn't think anything of it but now I'm realizing that something could well be the issue...

I'm well aware that smoking weed can increase the risk of psychosis and I'm planning to stop real soon. But what I'm really asking is, based on what I've said above, is it possible weed has made me develop some sort of mental disorder that needs to be checked by a psychologist or psychiatrist? ",0,1

It's the full Kanye interview at TMZ. It was very hard to watch, almost felt like a punch to the gut. It really took me back to the first time I had a psychotic break and the months that followed. The vibe he gives off and the way he talks is eerily similar to what I went through. 

It's painful to watch for me at least. In another interview with Charlagmagne, at the very end, he hinted that he was on medication but called it an ""imperfect solution"". I'm really rooting for this guy to be successful against all odds, to beat w/e he's going through would give me so much hope, but idk.... I hope I'm not reading too hard into this. Kanye seems like the type of guy where you have to listen to him for a bit to see the bigger picture he's trying to paint but this interview is waaay different than the one he did with Charlamagne, it's just very off....

1102,46mcd8,PLEASE READ Need thoughts/input about my condition!!,"Alright, so I'll try to make this as brief as possible but also completely convey to you all what I am going through. I have never used reddit before, I figured this would be where I could safely tell my experiences without embarrassment. 
I don't recall exactly an occurrence that I can say was the first one, but I believe that this all began sometime around November of last year. I only experience the voices in my head when I smoke weed which, I realize, makes it harder for people to sympathize because I could simply stop smoking weed but honestly I have yet to be able to quit and I am trying to get to the bottom of what is happening to me. The voices began not as voices, but as little whispers/murmurs from my roommates or the friends I was around. For a while, I didn't accept that it was all in my head so if I heard a whisper or something negative coming from someone, I would ask them what they said and they would say ""I didn't say anything"" I would hear them say things like ""ugh why doesnt she go to bed already? what is she doing?"" Pretty much the voices just try to make me feel like I'm stupid and that the people around me secretly hate me. So when they told me they didn't actually say anything, I began to think that maybe the voices were their thoughts and somehow I could hear them thinking badly about me. Obviously, this has really impaired my social life because the line between what I'm hearing in my head and how the people around me feel about me is starting to blur. I'm in the process of trying to redraw that line. So anyway, I hear the voices (as long as I'm high) no matter what, where or even when I'm alone. That is what brought me to the conclusion that there were in fact voices in my head because I heard them even when I was alone. Some experiences I've had have been laying in bed and hearing a group of people outside who I thought were watching me through my window and mocking me because I was too high, I have experienced my parents saying that I am worthless from the other room and plotting how they are going to go about getting me in trouble for smoking weed. In social settings, I will start to feel like I am being observed by my friends and then I can hear them talking about how I'm acting and how awkward it is. Once, the voices (who I thought were my friends talking about me) starting coming to the conclusion that I was actually autistic and thats why I can be so socially awkward sometimes, so for the rest of the day I really was scared that I had autism and never realized it. I have too many experiences that are even more disturbing than these to even fit in a post. Often, I am confused by my condition and my own thoughts about it because even though sometimes I truly am convinced that my friends are talking about me when I'm standing right next to them, I still don't say anything. Partly, that's because I'm afraid to confront people but also because sometimes, if the voices get me worked up enough to the point where I outwardly express my mental state (like if i start to cry) I will hear the voices say ""OH MY GOD YOU'RE FINE"" or ""dont worry, just stay quiet"" (something to that effect) The voices also make fun of me when they can tell that I am not sure if they are real or not. Last night was the worst experience I have had so far. It made me decide officially to stop smoking but then again, I've decided that before. I was hearing the voices and for once, they started to not sound so much like my roommates voices. They laughed at me for looking out the window because it sounded like and entire crowd of people in my head announcing things so I genuinely thought it might just be coming from outside but when I went to peek through my blinds I heard, ""oh my god, shes looking out the window"" followed by laughs and other things making fun of me. There are several different voices and all of them sound like a different person I know such as my roommates, my parents, my brother, some other friends, etc. and they will sometimes say things that make me think its actually them talking to me through a parallel universe or something. I'm still so conflicted about what is going on here and where it came from. Is this spiritual or purely psychological? Is it demonic? Sometimes I think so, especially when the voices really scare me. It scares me because sometimes along with the voices, I will experience physical symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking/fidgeting, shaky vision, and clenching my teeth. Also last night while i was laying in bed waiting for the voices to quiet down so I could sleep, I started shaking and my eyes kept rolling back and I heard one of the voices that sounded like my mom scream ""Shes seizing!!"" The voice sounded very concerned about me. Please help me.. this is an ongoing struggle and I don't know how to deal with this, what to think of it, or who to talk to about it. I'm also very concerned that the voices will spill over into my sober life. That is when I would decide to get real help, but I'm hoping I wont ever need to do that. There's a lot more that I experience with this, though, but this is the general description of it. If you read this whole thing, thank you so much. I really appreciate you.",1,1
1103,3xzbuk,Do I have schizophrenia?,"On top of having /r/misophonia, I think I may also have another mental disorder. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was young and my aunt has bipolar disorder but what I am experiencing is more than just mood swings.

I feel like my misophonia is being tied with scizophrenia. I have delusions that people try to make lip-smacking sounds at me on purpose, and that everyone knows it bothers me and does it to me for... reasons, whether the person has seen me before or not.

- I tend to have egotistical mood swings, but that might the tied with bipolar disorder

- I lost interest in daily activities because I am afraid that I will run into lip-smackers outside. I don't clean myself or clean up after myself. I am also very disorganized

- I am careless and often try to hurt myself mentally

- I laugh at things that aren't funny or find things funny that others wouldn't find funny. on the other hand, the things that normal people laugh at I think is completely stupid and unfunny

- The rare moments that I feel happy, someone or something has to immediately crush it from me.

- I never find the right words to use when talking to people

- I am constantly afraid about sharing my feelings, even if what I have to say may sound completely normal, but I just don't want anyone to know. I also don't want them to smack their lips and take my feelings away from me.

- Whenever I talk to people, people automatically hate me because I'm so out of touch and awkward

- I never talk to people because people are evil and are only good for hurting others. (Spreading rumors, insulting others, being dominant, etc.) On top of that, people are just so damn edgy. If you say one thing wrong, people will go apeshit on you.

So do I also have schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or BOTH?",0,1

1105,3o9j3p,"I fell in love with a woman with paranoid schizophrenia, and now my heart is destroyed","I honestly don't know why I'm posting this here. I don't have anyone to turn to, no one to talk to. I'm all alone in a city I'm still new to, now that my partner left. But I can't handle not getting this stuff out of me head.

The first week of July, I met the most amazing person I've ever met in my life. We bonded really deeply, rather quickly. We both had abusive pasts, both dealt with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and she dealt with schizophrenia, paranoid type. I believe one of the many reasons we got on so well, was that neither of us saw the other *as* our mental struggles.

For the next two months and change, we both had the time of our lives, quite literally. Because of my very prolonged history of abuse, I had never actually been happy before. Even while being out of my abuse, my life has been quite horrible. But I met someone who finally *acted* in love and care, they weren't simply words. For literally the first time in my life I was happy.

Both of our lives began to improve. She began smoking less (something I had encouraged but never *made* her do, from the start), she went through a span of trying to ween herself off her antidepressant, and when she had a minor schizophrenic break during that time I had to take her to a hospital, where I learned that she had been planning on killing herself. She went back on her antidepressant the next day, like I had been trying to gently get her to do. It was a bump, but she bounced back and things kept getting slowly better.

Her judgement from the go was clearly unsound, she acted incredibly self-destructively, and said that she felt she deserved it. But I had been very gently helping her make better and better decisions. She really did show marked improvement. Other than her antidepressant and antipsychotic which were prescribed a year ago when she had a psychotic break, she wouldn't seek any other treatment. I tried very hard to get her to get into therapy, get a new doctor to help her with her meds. She'd make excuse after excuse, and eventually just admitted that she was making excuses but that was how it was.

After trying for months, I finally landed a job, and ended up getting her two jobs because of my writing experience and her personability. The night before one of her interviews, she got stoned, knowing full well that there would be a drug test. This was a clear act of self-sabotage, in my view. Thankfully they drug tested her a second time later on, our guess being that the first was inconclusive.

When the stresses of work started baring down on both of us, as our new jobs started, we both became overwhelmed. I with my anxiety, her with her paranoid delusions. I bounced back, she seemed to finally be bouncing back around the end of August. Then she very suddenly (two days) changed.

The morning of the last Thursday of August, she dumped me over text. No explanation, no warning, the last thing she said to me two days beforehand was ""I think we're gonna be okay."" She didn't want to be friends, wouldn't give me anything other than ""I have my reasons.""

This is when she started treating me badly at work, which started triggering panic attacks in me. I can't go into that piece of things any more, as I have a lawyer working on the fact that I no longer work there.

Before this, when we were doing great, I tried to introduce a friend into our mix, as we're both rather new here. This person ended up being really horrible. They physically assaulted me in front of my partner (my partner said later made her really uncomfortable), which I responded to with a hug since I don't believe in non-consensual violence. I also learned later on that this person used me to get to my partner.

I mention this, because during September I brought this person up as it became clear that they had influenced my partner's decisions and actions. My partner went from previously disliking that this person attacked me unprovoked and hard enough to cause bruises, to defending them outright.

Two days ago, they moved into a one bedroom apartment together. Before work started, when we were still doing great, my partner had an honest distaste for this person for how they treated me. And now, after knowing each other for not even a month, they're living together.

I have been living out of my car since I got here, back in March. I have been working my ass off, fighting for my life. She lived in a $2,000,000 mansion, rent free, paid zero living expenses. Now I'm out of a job, have no friends here, no partner, I was nearly off the streets right before I lost my job. Because of this awful person's manipulation of myself and my partner, everything has gone to shit, and I can't do anything about it.

At one point I tried speaking with the family here that she was staying with. Her uncle wouldn't let me speak to her aunt (his behavior during the time I was aware of him seemed rather unintentionally abusive), and simply ignored me, yelled at me, and threatened me.

I don't really have a point I'm headed towards here. I'm not really asking for anyone to do anything, since no one really can. I guess this is more just me venting somewhere, since I don't have anyone to talk with in person.

I'm not mad at my partner, I don't blame her for the words and actions that to me seemed to clearly come from her mental illness, and from the other person. I'm absolutely outraged at the other person, though. And I honestly feel like she's being used and taken advantage of by this person, which was actually something I was trying to make sure *didn't* happen to her, because she put herself into situations like that.

1106,3fsda1,Has anyone here ever done psychedelics?,"#I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm not asking if I should do psychedelics nor am I encouraging anyone with a mental health issue to use substances of any kind. So please don't yell at me without reading the whole post!

---

So, I've done psychedelics a few times, and the most recent times got pretty weird. I lost track of reality and descended into my mind acting very weird. I had a lot of short term memory loss and some symptoms have flared up again since (only very slightly though). The substances I had said experiences on are LSD and MDMA. Out of the large amount of times I've used MDMA in the past, only the most recent one gave me a weird experience, and it was very dulled down in comparison to my LSD experiences. All of which have been weird. I've done other drugs without weird experiences though (25-i-nbome [an LSD substitute], marijuana, alcohol).

Now, I know that schizophrenics can be attracted to psychedelics, so I was wondering if maybe the experiences I had could be brought on by schizophrenia of some kind, and wanted to hear any experiences you guys have had.

I'd rather not explain my experiences just yet, since in the past I've had three types of answers 'It's just the drugs', 'it's an effect called ego-death' 'It's schizophrenia'. And because of this variation in answers, I'd rather hear experiences and make my own judgements.

1111,cqnxi7,Schizophrenia is not inherently an illness but it becomes one if you treat it like one,"I wanted to make this post because I used to suffer a lot from my schizophrenia but I can honestly say that today I don't have a single problem with who I am. I know a lot of you guys suffer a lot too but I just wanted to let you know that it doesn't have to be that way. You are not doomed to be sick or disabled and you can actually use your schizophrenia to your advantage if you stop viewing it as an illness and instead view it as a tool. I know many of you have probably given up hope that things can ever be good and that you will just have to settle with surviving, but I promise you that you can get better. You probably won't stop hallucinating or having delusions, I haven't at least, but it doesn't have to be bad.

In order to ""fix"" myself and make myself better I tried the best science oriented approach I could find, pulling from all sorts of resources. At one point I noticed that what science is pointing towards is what all spiritual teachings have been saying for thousands of years and when I started researching things such as Buddhism, Tantra, Yoga, Shamanism, Christianity and whatever spiritual teaching everything about schizophrenia and our minds in general just made perfect sense.

Schizophrenia is more or less just you having spiritual or psychedelic experiences when you don't really want to. Spiritual experiences can be frightening and confusing if you haven't done all the groundwork people usually have to do to get these kind of experiences. Someone might have to meditate daily for 40 years to reach a point where they feel the oneness of the universe and such but schizophrenics often just get these experiences without even trying or asking for it. 

In the psychedelic drug communities people often talk about the importance of integrating their psychedelic trips before tripping again. This is because they are suddenly thrown into a world so alien and strange to them that in their sober life it will take some time to make sense of everything. As schizophrenics we don't have the opportunity to go back to our normal sober life, because strange, alien and confusing is our sober state. So what do we do? How do we make sense of everything, when everything is so chaotic and confusing? Short answer is, we don't.

Slightly longer answer is that we start by accepting what is happening. Is your hallucinations going to go away by you not wanting to have them? Is your voices going to stop because you tell them to? Is your delusions going away simply because you say it's not real? No, it usually only makes them worse because you are resisting something which already is, something that can't be changed because it has already happened and if you are constantly in a state of resistance you are constantly in a fight or flight mode, which means you are constantly stressed and stress just makes everything worse. So what do we do?

Well it's not actually about what we can do, it's more about what not to do. First of all, listen to whatever people are trying to tell you in order to help but understand that if the neurotypical mind is like a hammer, then the schizophrenic mind is a screwdriver. Psychiatrist and everyone else is trying to teach you how to build a house with a hammer but of course you are going to end up frustrated because you don't have the right tool for the job! You can't just copy what works for ordinary people because your mind is not ordinary. Accept this and fully accept it. You are not going to be ordinary, ever. Not going to happen, so you can either resist for the rest of your life or start living the life you were supposed to. Sure you can dull your mind with anti-psychotics and if you are happy with doing that, then keep doing you, I wasn't though. I wanted to experience everything life had to offer me and I simply couldn't do that while being sedated 24/7.

You end up suffering from schizophrenia if your mind has become stronger than you. Your mind and your body is simply an accumulation of everything that has happened to you, but it is not you. You are something else. You can't control your mind, thoughts simply come and go, you can't control what you see, what you hear, feel, smell, all these things are just happening without your control, the only thing you really have control over is your attention. 

Wherever you put your attention, that is what your mind and body will interpret as important. If you pay attention to the negative voices, your mind will deem them important and keep energizing them because you give them attention. The mind is like a bully, it will keep taunting you in every way possible but like any bully they are only doing it to get a reaction out of you. If you simply stay indifferent and just observe you stop energizing the mind and the bullying stops. Buddhism calls this the ""monkey mind"" but in the case of schizophrenics it's not really a monkey but more like a 500-pound genetically modified war-ape on steroids. You will have to work a little bit harder than ordinary people to keep that in check. 

How do we get to a point where we can just observe without energizing the mind? Well there are lots of systems that teach you exactly this. Buddhism, Tantra and Yoga are systems developed exactly for this purpose and while they are great, they do have their flaws. All of these systems where developed for societies way less advanced and chaotic than our modern society and because of this there is sort of a mismatch between the teachings and our reality. I am currently in the process of writing a book that will talk about this and much more in detail because even this long Reddit post is barely scratching the surface of what there is to say.  

I wish you all good luck and if anyone needs someone to talk to about anything or if you have any questions or criticism on anything that I've said, just throw it my way and I'll be happy to answer. Peace and love my friends.",6,1

1116,11gmomr,Would these be signs of schizophrenic disorder?,"I wondered if the following symptoms would be the onset of a schizophrenic disorder. I'm not really familiar with the disorder but I had a partner who ticked some boxes, and I'm kind of worried about his situation and mental health. 

First of all it was religious delusions. Strong belief that God had a big mission for him and that he had to do something extraordinary in the world, a mission assigned by God. I remember that when we were together he would continuously tell me that God communicated with him and told him how we could fix our relationship. 

Specially when he was ill (had fever) or he had smoked weed, he would literally have real hallucinations, most times involving Jesus or angels, and a sense of inner fulfillment when experiencing those hallucinations. He literally told me he saw angels going towards a high tower and Jesus and his disciples sitting around a table, with him. 

Fear of persecution was a constant issue with him. If he was driving the car he would think people behind him were following him. If he was working along the street he would think anyone behind him was following him. He would get absolutely paranoid and be sure of that, it would trigger extreme anxiety and fear in him. 

He also had other type of delusions in which he was sure he would become very rich and various cults would try to recruit him.

He had a job interview at a Chinese company and for whatever reason he was sure those people were spies. He called the CIA to inform about it and he was angry that the CIA never contacted him back to collect more info. 

He was also very paranoid with me, continuously distrusting and attacking me for perceived slights or delusions of me cheating on him. 

So I'm not attempting to diagnose this person but I'm kind of worried that if he continues untreated this can develop into something more and something worse. I don't know if I should warn his parents, or just let it go. I also don't want to assume things that are not true and I think this community can help me clarify doubts around this illness.

Person has thoughts all day long, thinking all the time, even when relaxing.  So with this stuff that you and I have, tho, all of a sudden the world answers back, world ""talks"" to us in ways it didn't used to, or does with other people.  So when it's once in a while, it's a ""sign"", and can be fun.

When it goes all damn day long, from wake-up to falling asleep, it's a person that literally never shuts up, and they ain't really all that nice, to put it lightly, and they're talking straight to your thoughts.

Your thoughts are the locusts, and the ""answers"" from the world are the tails, and they do hurt, after the first cool five minutes, after which it ain't cool any more.  And you can't get away from it.  Even gettin fucked up don't help.

Any of this sound familiar?

Below I'm linking three threads.  First one links to the second one, and the third one is in the same sub.

The first two are short and deal with major unpleasantness not necessarily having to do with schizophrenia.  The third one is longer and discusses several things, but eventually it gets around to discussing this condition you and I have.

You can skip the first two, go straight to the third one.  The schizophrenia discussion ain't too awful far into it.

Reading all three will let you know what and who and when and where you are, and that will help you out, some, I think.  Won't claim it's all sunshine and bunnies though.  In fact, many people can't make it through one or two, let alone all three.

Did you go through the intense paranoia phase yet?

Laughing.  Cuz I'm definitely out to get you.  I'm teasing.  No one is reading your thoughts, really.  Boy, I got so paranoid, I don't even have friends left, pretty much.  That and the general alienation from the difference between me and everyone else I knew, I've gotten used to just hanging out by myself.  Can't even be around other people very long, even though I'm not at all paranoid any more.  Went about an hour and a half or so the other night, and that's the longest I've hung out in some time.

Honestly, I don't want to get any close to her to know it). She is living with me and my parents now.

Right around the same time, my mother noticed that 200 bucks were missing from her purse.

We were suspicious of everybody but decided that maybe, we had spent it and forgot about . A few days ago, I noticed that 20 bucks of mine vanished right after my sister went to my room to get a nailclipper. Me and my mother confronted her about it and she swear she didnt take it and even showed us that she had her money on her wallet and didnt need to steal but she was the ONLY person that saw where I put my money and the ONLY person I saw entering my room. I know it was her. My mother told me she saw her in her room one night before the 200 bucks disapeared but she said she was just looking for a shirt.

Is it possible that she is stealing stuff and forgetting about it? Or is she liying for some other weird reason?",2,1

1143,w89253,"Spirits are real, and I had a long term relationship with one. (In response to ""Relationship with a hallucination"")","I wrote this as a comment on the mentioned post, but it was too long to post. If you care to have context, please go read that post so you understand what I am responding to. 
 I couldnt remove anything and feel okay about it, so I'm posting it as it's own post. I'm very interested in your input, as I truly do believe I am a relatively sane and stable person when I make the effort to be. I can't in good conscience pretend that I don't believe this, but I am not hallucinating, and I have thought about it for years. I've talked to therapists about it, I've talked with professors about it, ice approached it as a delusional belief as thoroughly as I've approached it as a philosophical conundrum. And I have no answers, and no sure conclusions. This is just another approach, a small step towards having the full, real, picture. 







""This gives me chills. I know an ""entity"" like that, I call her Eirie, (I-Ree). I don't experience hallucinations regularly, though I am prone to delusional thinking, but I have had a years long on-and-off habit of taking delerient drugs. (I won't share the exact substance, but if you know, you know). And without fail, every time I take them, she is right there. I've had people tell me they experienced her in their own sober lives after I told them about her, even though every time I tell someone, they chalk it up to a hallucination and a delusion, or to mental illness. 

She started off as a good friend, and it seemed like she really liked me, and having a conscious back and forth with me. So I would get high just to hang out with her, and she would push me to stay high, take more, ""so we can be together"", and she would teach me things about what she called ""magic"", and I really would be able to use those things she taught me to some noticable effect. Her ""magic"" is the same thing as what people call ""the law of attraction"", and it works as much as the LoA works. What's really interesting is that she would give me all this information, and all these creative ideas, and it was all stuff that I couldnt have known or just come up with. It was really information from outside myself. 



Well as time went on, I started to realize the harm I was doing to myself and my loved ones by spending days and weeks in psychosis, endlessly wandering the streets or pacing my house, talking to myself, playing with the hallucinations. And she started to get mean, and play tricks on me. (She always plays tricks regardless, but these new tricks were very cruel and painful, where before they were mainly just silly and entertaining).  



I've been sober all the way for some time now, and I don't really deal with her these days, except in my dreams, and occasionally when I haven't slept for a while. 


But as I sobered up, I fell in love with this real girl, who I trusted like no one else, enough that I eventually told her about all of this. 

Imagine my surprise when she said ""I've known her for years, she's the one who made me seek you out in the first place."" 


So I dropped everything in my life and flew across the country to meet this girl and figure out this incredibly unlikely mystery. 

To skip a lot of details, we'll just say this: when her and I were in psychosis at the same time, we both heard and dealt with this entity. I would hear the same things she would hear, and either of us could go ""what did Eirie just say?"" And always have the same answer. Freaky right? 


But I'm not in a place in my life where I want to spend all my time high or in psychosis. I stopped taking drugs and spinning myself further out, after a couple weeks or so, while my partner continued her use at the same rate for the entire year long relationship.



What I've come to believe, is that Eirie is real, and not unique to me or anyone else. Possibly she's what other cultures have referred to as a ""trickster god"". She plays pranks and offers puzzling, bizarre insights, and seems to be a consistent ego. She receives payment for her information in the form of confusion, and despair, and sorrow, and remorse. Negative emotions seem to charge her up and make her strong and happy. Positive emotions make her cruel, and petty, kind of snide and bratty. 


Well my point is this. I chose to connect with her (Eirie), and repeatedly decided to foster a relationship for her, even when it cost me greatly in my every day life. I gave her as much time as you would any girlfriend or partner, and I chose her company over human company every time. 



And then one day I just stopped doing that, and I suppose I didn't really explain it to her, because I believed at the time, that experiencing her presence was in and of itself a symptom of my mental illness, and I thought that if I stopped taking the drugs, a lot of my mental problems would instantly get better.

But I introduced her to my partner, and they had a relationship as well. And the more I pulled away from those kinds of thoughts, the further into psychosis my partner would slip, no drugs necessary. 


I still feel hesitant to talk about it as anything other than an imaginary delusion, for fear of sounding crazy, but I can't deny that she created a rift in that relationship, which directly resulted in much pain and misery and negativity for everyone involved. She stuck herself to my unprepared partner, and seemed to manipulate her actions, and drastically change her behavior, over time. I just this lovely person turning colder and crueler, and I didn't think anything about Erie being involved. I'd been sober a while and had not interacted with her in quite some time. I al.kst forgot about her. Ultimately though, I feel that she wanted me back, as a ""partner"" or more realistically, a ""thrall"", and she did everything in her power to drive every wedge between me and this girl I loved. She succeeded, and I've recently interacted with her for the first time in a long time. and she let me know how she felt, in no uncertain terms 



This is the shortest way I can tell this story and do it justice, but the final overall point is this:


Demons, ghosts, spirits, lesser gods, the fae, whatever your culture calls them, are real. We've been told this by our ancestors for all of recorded time, so it's no cutting edge theory here. 
I made deals with this entity, and I walked away from it with stuff still on the table, so to speak. And so she came and cashed in on what she was owed. 

But I let her do it, by choosing to go to psychosis and deal with her, and by introducing her intimately to my ex partner. These entitiea are lesser beings than we are, and they can't hardly make any difference to anything without human help. They use and manipulate and cut deals from a position of superiority, but their shameful secret is they're just souls like we are, and they don't have bodies anymore. To be a soul without a body is to truly know impotence and stagnation. Purgatory is real, and it's all around us, and it's simply the state of letting go of the attachment to the body, while still clinging to attachments of the mind. When the mind lets go too, only then is true death and reincarnation achieved. 


I don't know. Be careful, and believe her, but don't trust her. If you're going to deal in these realms it is absolutely necessary to ALWAYS remember, these are almost equal, but always objectively lesser beings. We in form are God's chosen incarnations, and them without form, are the echoes of misunderstood pain, and misguided wants, and deep profound misuses of the will and of the mind. They had bodies, and they died, and they hung around pouting And lamenting what they ""lost"" when they died.Namely the power to affect change. To them life is an unresponsive movie on a screen, in a dark forever unchanging room.

We souls, incarnate in bodies, are the actors, and the only actors. Not only are we the actors, we're the writer, director, and producer, of this dynamic and limitless life. Put that way, one would hope it's easy enough to understand why these entities tend to be resentful and bitter, and why they invariably, always, interfere in situations where it is possible to influence a live human to act according to the will of this powerless being. 


To wrap it up, I'll quote Philip k Dick.

I am intelligent with an insanely high IQ and I detect things with clear and concrete evidence that someone is after me, and i often look for them and have an open mind, i am not delusional like you who believe things with no evidence, and hallucinate like you are on shrooms and drugs, i am perfectly sound.

i find it absurd that the doctor thinks i have this condition, i am completely reasonable and rational, i see things further than anyone, and able to connect the dots faster than anyone, they just go ahead and labeled me a schizo, hahaha, what a load of bogus.

i had cyberstalkers that were stalking me, i proved it, it's real. I had friends talking behind my back, i proved, i had a guy spreading lies and rumors about me and i proved it, i can sense and analyze people's behaviour better than anyone, everything is backed up by evidence, I took an IQ test and scored 140+, i am not insane.

Also once i am reassured by actively seeking out concrete evidence that someone is not after me, i no longer get delusions, i feel relieved and it generally never comes back since it's proven to me.

unlike schizophrenics who despite evidence being put out to them, they still really thinks it's the case. Delusional disorder fits me more than schizophrenia.

1147,b7o7wj,Psychiatrists Wake Up,"Psychiatrists out there who treat schizophrenia are getting this wake up call: schizophrenia is related to the ongoing production of the DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine) - the ""neurotransmitter of childhood"" in adults. Schizophrenia mainly gets reported during the transition to adulthood because this is when DMT production gets turned off in most ""normal"" people.  

  

In the cases where schizophrenia gets diagnosed earlier than adulthood, a misdiagnosis has occurred.  In these cases, the patient reports on painful or terrifying events to which they are being subjected, and the doctors fails to recognize these as actual occurrences, and the patient gets painted with the scarlet letter of schizophrenia at an early age.

  

Now, you psychiatrists who have an interest in furthering your careers - being the smartest of the smart doctor - you'll want to jump on this area of inquiry.  Unfortunately you won't be able to claim credit for discovering this, as, clearly, this idea is now public domain, but you can certainly use it to your advantage to get yourselves on TV.

1149,4yuh9w,Is schizophrenia akin to a permenant trip without psychedelia?,"For reasons unknown, since I can remember, I've always been interested in schizophrenics. My recent use of psychedelic drugs had spun me even deeper into enthusiasm of researching this *amazing condition* we call schizophrenia.

My question is pretty simple; can anyone here relate these two states, in any way? I've heard that the same receptors in the brain might play a role in both *tripping* and schizophrenia. I've heard a pretty legit theory, that in both cases, a specific *brain filter* is not working fully - a filter, which prevents our minds from recieving 'a full load' of information (which includes all repressed/'forgotten' memories, imagination,..) - This *brain filter's* main function is to prevent us from recieving too much 'useless' mess of information, which is not important for our survival. That means, that when this filter is not working properly, it allows imagination to pass through more freely, into our conscious. I imagine to the point, where we can't tell the difference between our senses and imagination.

I've heard that first signs, beginning of schizophrenia, might even be interesting, aspiring, to some people.. Some become more enthusiastic about day to day things, it might be creatively beneficial.. for a period of time. 

But then, in most cases, chaos seems to take over. A person seems to be stuck, unable to integrate anything, not able to 'upgrade' himself in any way. It can turn into literal hell. But that doesn't neccesarily mean diabolical visions or this kinds of *spooky* phenomena - there are alot more terrifying things. Being unable to view the world as something other than disgusting, sinister joke of existence - that, I think, can be the most horrifying hell. I imagine it to the point, where these *visions* are the only possible distraction from this absurd state of being.

I don't know where I'm getting at this exactly. I guess back to my question. Does anyone have any experience/knowledge in this subject, and is willing to share it?

1150,3aowjo,Schizophrenia and neurodiversity,"To begin with, I have bipolar disorder and ASD. I'm a strong supporter of neurodiversity. Here are my arguments:

Why should schizophrenia be considered a disease? What is a disease and what isn't is poorly defined. Schizophrenia is a difference which can't be cured. Sure - it can, if the symptoms are not controlled enough, cause distress to the person or other people. In this case, treatments are prescribed for the results of this difference. However, if the symptoms don't cause any distress to others or the person in question, why should this difference be systematically treated? What I'm saying is that it's not a disease by itself. It can cause distress, but it doesn't mean that it always has to be systematically treated.


This might sound strange, and I acknowledge it. But think of, say, race. According to scientific studies, there are various differences between races. Differences in IQ (with Eastern Asians being on top), differences in skin color, hair color, eye color. For a member of some race, their IQ may result in distress due to learning problems, for example. Then, that person is placed to special education programs and such, in order to help with the learning process caused by an IQ difference. But does it mean that the entire race which has an average IQ lower than an arbitrary, socially constructed notion of ""acceptable IQ"" should be placed in special education programs? I don't think so.

Just as autism is more and more accepted as a difference, I don't see why many so-called mental illnesses shouldn't be accepted as a difference. Don't get me wrong - these differences can cause distress. But they're still differences, not diseases. Even autism has approved treatment which control some symptoms, such as irritability (ex: atypical anti-psychotics). But it doesn't mean that it's a disease. It means that sometimes, some traits which accompany the difference can cause distress to the person or others. But it isn't always the case.


We're different and unique, not diseased and undesired. Perhaps, schizophrenia was an evolutionary advantage in the past, but is simply not as advantageous now. Should we also treat all, say, ""ugly"" people? Should we also, as a society, propose surgery for them in a systematic manner? Why not? After all, being ugly can often cause distress. (Even though what is ugly now could be beautiful in the past; due to various differences in cultural views on what beauty is.)

Please note that I'm not against treatment. I take psychiatric medication myself. But I still consider myself different, not diseased.",0,1

1156,4f5wtf,I'll be blunt: I don't think schizophrenics should have biological children.,"I want to rant and get this off my chest.

As we all know, this disease has genetic causes. That being said, I resent my mother for having me because schizophrenia runs in her family. I wish I had never been born. 

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizophrenia&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop#Genetic) the greatest cause of schizophrenia is due to genetic factors. Even if the heritable risk is a measly 6-12% (assuming one parent has it, the risk is far greater if both parents have the condition) it's still too much of a risk in my opinion. That gamble is not worth it, not in the slightest. Do I think schizophrenia automatically means you're going to be a shit parent? Not at all.

But nobody should have to live with one of the most hellish and debilitating conditions to ever exist. I wouldn't wish schizophrenia on my worst enemy, and I will not risk having it passed down by having a child. I've obtained a vasectomy for this exact reason. If you want to have children in your life, I think you should adopt.

One thing is for certain though. On my deathbed I can pass away happy at the fact that I did not propagate my inferior genes.

1157,10q3zdv,Could this be schizophrenia?,"How common it is to have schizophrenia without hallucinations?

Until recently I thought I might not have positive symptoms, but now I feel like I might have delusions:

I usually think that people instantly hate me, even when I clearly see later that it wasn’t true, but they started acting weird around me because I am kinda different than others. Sometimes I feel like people are talking about me, even though they might not. When I hear some people laughing a lot of times I feel like they are laughing at me. When I notice that someone is looking at me I think that they probably laugh at me in their heads.

Sometimes I think that restaurants from which I am ordering food onlline regularly are talking about me as “this guy is ordering again, he is so weird”. This thought is so stupid, when I think about it now, wtf? They probably don’t care at all how much I am ordering.

Sometimes I hear my manager at work calling with my other manager and I am thinking they might be talking about me how bad performance I am showing lately and that they want to fire me. It might be true, but why do I feel like it is destroying me. Why do I believe that they do it, I mean they could just talk to me instead and tell me that I am not doing very good lately, but they don’t. It’s like I feel like they are conspiring about me.

But I don’t have any hallucinations as far as I know. I don’t hear any voices, no visual hallucinations. Or maybe I am wrong and everything I see is a hallucination?

I am also delusional that there is something wrong with my health, I was like this my whole life, I was always thinking that I have some serious physical illnesses. Last time I thought I had heart attack. I didn’t, but I had symptoms (or at least I thought I had). Before that I thought I was going blind. I thought I had Hepatitis and lots of other illnesses, which turned out to be false.

Maybe me thinking I have schizophrenia is also just a delusion. 🤔

Because of this I am even aftraid to go to doctor with other illnesses so I won’t be sent away again that there is nothing wrong with me.

For 29 years, I had no mental health issues. Then, in September 2021, I had a vision of a man sitting behind a desk giving me an evil grin. I told him to go away and a voice told me that I shouldn't have done that. He went away.

I received a notification on my phone of a friend request for Snapchat. It didn't look right. It was malicious and installed some type of program on my phone to mirror my phone. I have pictures if you're interested. The viewers had Instant Apps downloaded on their phones where they could watch me. Note: the program author is Google Play Store. Real Google Apps are signed by Google, LLC.

After verifying that people were watching me, I deleted Snapchat and reported it. A day later, I started getting these weird energy attacks in the left side of my head that was inducting intrusive thoughts. It went on for a month before I went to the Emergency Room.

My parents were in the room. I told the doctor what was going on, but he was visibly angry. It seems possessed. I said whoever did this I forgive him. He got really angry at that and asked my mom to come with him. The doctor instructed my mom to call crisis to initiate an involuntary hold. The crisis team said there were no grounds. **That's when the doctor took the phone from my mom and said I was homicidal. It even says in the notes, Mom failed to mention homicidal ideations. I never said anything homicidal.**  So I was involuntarily admitted. The energy attacks and intrusive thoughts stopped immediately.

After 9 days, I got out and took the medicine for two months and then decided to quit cold turkey. Things were fine for two months after I quit and then the weirdness started. One honorable mention was a false call to the police that I was saying disturbing things to a bus driver. **Not true.** Some time after that I had a weird shock to the heart and I called home to let them know I felt like I was having a heart attack.

My mom is very overbearing and has been ever since I was small. I (20) live alone and she lives on in the middle of nowhere (farm) where there is nothing to do in a small house. I like my home and feel good living alone with my cats. but since two months ago, she doesn’t leave me alone. A doctor told her it’s best to not let me be alone.

Because of her work, she needs to be home.  She makes me go with her. I am very unhappy at her house and 60% of the week and time I am stuck in her house and the other 40% I’m allowed to be back home.

I have gained weight. have struggled with eating my entire life because of my parents eating patterns. Upset? Eat. Happy? Eat. I learnt to live a healthy lifestyle after living alone. I love working out and going for long walks but now, I am unable to do so because I can’t be alone. She doesn’t get how bad it makes me feel. 

I told my mom that I am upset the way she is making me eat and not allowing me to workout or go for walks. I told her it’s unhealthy how much weight I’ve gained in a short time and now I am very upset because I have absolutely no control over my life and it’s constant bad though and the voices are so awful I can’t stop them when I am like this. My mom said I’m not eating too much but I am. 

I just want to be alone again not because I want to do something unhinged but I am just too overwhelmed. I got taken off all my meds (adhd and birth control for hormones) and I just hate this I can’t take this experience anymore. 

The clinic that will help me will call me next week after a month of waiting to get in and two hospital visits later. 

Can someone just tell me I’m okay to be alone? She talks to me like a child now and I feel so useless here with her. I have no control over my life and don’t want to go from house to house anymore. I just want to be with my cats in my own home.",0,1

1178,116xbiu,help me.,"So I believe I have schizophrenia, I have only had 3 delusions to my knowledge. I am convinced that my friends planted a mic in my car and my room to fuck with me. I was smoking weed at a park in my car, and a door behind me was randomly opened. I don't know how it could've been, I have no recollection of this happening I sped out of there as fast as I could and then my car turned off while I was driving and I pulled off to the side. I heard someone walk closer and closer to me and stay around me just out of my line of sight. This went on for hours and thought I was being stalked. As I was driving back I caught a glimpse of a good friend of mine's jacket behind me in the back seat and heard knocks affirming what I was saying was being heard by someone. Today I caught my other friends hearing me when I was muted. I don't know how that could have been a delusion because it's what they said to me with my mic was not turned on. At this point I don't know what to do but to distance myself from them or go to a ward. I don't like not being able to trust my eyes, ears, and deductive reasoning skills.

1181,10e46vw,Schizophrenic or spiritual,"Hi
I am a female and i believe i might possibly be struggling with schizophrenia and not actually just spirtual 
I have been diagnosed with BPD & informally (by a psychologist not a psychiatrist) with BDD 
My mom (a doctor) believed i’m extremely paranoid and that i have schizophrenia, i have yet to bring it up with my psychiatrist sir even discuss the symptoms 
I also have family history of schizophrenia (my aunt having had it, she has completely abandoned my family, but my father constantly tells me how i am going down the same path)
anyways 
ever since i have started using shrooms this has been exacerbated 
1. i am convinced i can see souls & intentions
2. auditory hallucinations that constantly will tell me that the looming is there and that i have to get out if i want the looming to stop, i genuinely think that this might just be me sending negative energy
3. i believe everyone besides my sister cat and bestfriend have a negative agenda
4. i believe most people are unconscious 
5. that i constantly ask for “signs” and i get them, i was told it might be a symptom of schizophrenia but i have had one instance that i o me proves other wise, one night my family point out to deer in my backyard so i was like how cool, this rarely happens so i am like okay if i’m headed down a good path, send me a fox because to this point i have only seen a fox twice, anyways literally the next day just less then 24 hours later there was a fox in my backyard, 2 actually 
another instance (which i can provide proof)
how i felt that there was the looming and i texted my bestfriend about it and i tried to play it off and calm myself down so i go into my kitchen to make tea to calm down and as soon as i do, the loudest alarm blares, not even 10 minutes after i sent the text, and the alarm was a false alarm with nothing to back it, i just feel like this to me proves i wither have something hovering and fucking with me and i feel so scared as i write this because of it
6. consistent paranoia that everyone is after me and they hate me and are just playing normal to use me for their negative agenda, I am. very very paranoid in general and i’m so scared all the time from social media, tiktok etc
7. i am scared of a lot of things because i’m scared they will mess with my vibrations, foods, music, people etc
9. cannot go to big settings because i feel so anxious of negative vibrations,
10. i am anxious if drinking water outside of my home because i am scared it’s fluoridated
11. i dont think most people are real and i feel so blanked and that i am constantly the centre of the attention in a negative way because i have something hidden, i Feel like there’s constantly the anxiety that someone will find out what i know
12. i believe my brother has some sort of sabotaging agenda after me, i feel extremely unsettled around him because i believe he is some sort of manifestation of someone that’s after me, i have a lot of negative memories alongside him as he has always used my fears to make fun of me and he has fed me a lot of the stories as a kid that scared the crap out of me",0,1
1182,zkqzne,I have a question about voices,"I hope this post does not come off as rude or invasive.

I have a question about voices from the perspective of someone who has DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder). I hear voices, they come from my alters. They're not audible voices or hallucinations, but I hear them as if it were internal monologue. My alters have personalities of their own and are very multifaceted, just like me.

From what I understand, people with schizophrenia hear voices too, but it's much different from having alters. These voices are audible, yes? What confuses me is that some people on the schizophrenia spectrum describe these voices as if they have personalities of their very own, despite being hallucinations. 

What are specific things that indicate that the auditory voice hallucinations are simply just... voices? Are they incredibly one dimensional things? do these things only say specific words?

I'd like to understand this better.",0,1

I have extreme anxiety in crowded spaces to the point that if I dont take clonazepam I cannot leave the house, A lot of times it feels like people can hear my thoughts (like I say them out loud without actually saying them) and I know it isn't real but it feels very real at that moment, sometimes when people have a conversation I feel like they are repeating stuff I'm saying without realizing I'm actually saying that stuff until they say it in the conversation, A lot of times when I want to have a conversation with someone I say something in my head but am not able to say it out loud no matter how hard I try when those things happen I just want to isolate myself and if I'm home I just lock myself in my room.

  
I have checked the symptoms for schizo, derealization and cptsd and each of them sounds like what I have but not 100%.  
schizo - I realize what ever is happening isn't real  
derealization - I don't feel like I'm outside my body/can't control it  
cptsd - I dont have flashbacks or remember any trauma

1186,yxwymf,did anyone here try vitamin supplements vs medication I had psychosis which is a much more milder g8way of Skitz.,"I use vitamins to combat my symptoms now I had a post traumatic stress induced psychosis which was aggravated by marijuana. 

It got to the point where i was so insane and nobody pretended to care that I was fukt In the head. 

But today I'm good I take a vitamin every 5 days and it's enough specifically vitamin B12 the methlacloblamine version not the cycloblamine B12

Vitamin d3 is also helpful. 

I cann sometimes take a testosterone pill which is nugenix which has the vitamin in it and it functions great but I dont want to take testosterone till I'm well in my 60s.

Anyway I've been on anti psychotics and know how horrible life is on them and how it's on god not worth living. In Asia they're doing surgeries now with great success but there are failures and when the failures occur people are left dumb. But if you tried you could say you were part of the process to getting the job done. The only problem is, you need a doctor that is willing to spend a very large amount of time with you to gather all the details before going into a massive surgery likee that cause that's one mistake you wouldnt want to fuxk up.",0,1

1190,xlqa5k,Catch 22,"I suspect the guy I like is being mean again and I’m running in circles. There’s a song I like by machine gun Kelly called Home. I really miss the guy I like who hasn’t talked to me since Monday. But I’m also thinking about the kids. I believe there is a minority of the population who are considered untouchables who are tortured to the extreme in order for the majority to live in prosperity. Two such untouchables are single moms and my friends from support group. I feel like their strongest wish is to help their kids, also untouchables. I met one who is in high school and I got the delusion that he is already suffering, is not cool compared to his classmates, and probably will not go to university. Definitely I feel that there are kids who are less popular among gen z kids though for some reason I’m quite popular. I attended day treatment for example and one girl with depression looks like a misfit. I feel that girls with better looks tend to be considered cooler even if they are poor and don’t look good without makeup, etc. But I empathize with the feeling that the girl you like will not like you back and you are not allowed to be like everyone else. He does seem nice, though. Somehow the kids of mentally ill moms that I met tend to seem more responsible/mature maybe due to hardship they experienced. Years ago when I was first introduced I wanted to help but the cycle is a catch 22. Like a book I read called The Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao, he meets the same fate as the generations before him. I feel like one explanation is that they lack free will. I have my own ideas but for the time being I’d like to see the point of view of the guy I like.

1191,xekbc3,Thinking about my own life,"The guy I like really makes me feel miserable about being single. On another note I don’t want to give mentally ill people an unfair advantage especially over other stigmatized minority groups. I went to private school so I know some of the people who helped me are rich. But the people I chose to “promote” are mostly those from less privileged backgrounds. I actually hope they start lower to catch up to people who can already fight at a high level. Unfortunately you won’t improve until you drop the desire to be compensated for your mental illness. That said, there is something unrelated to wealth and power that I want to provide for the severely mentally ill. Idk how to explain it but they first have to accept being ordinary people to get it. It’s something I felt that money cannot buy.  I got all excited when I thought it was going to happen because it will bring a real difference to the mentally ill… but I realized it is beyond their understanding so much so that their dream life is luxury hotels and fine dining. I want the underprivileged to understand that nothing is free and the moral of the story is to follow your heart and not the things you’ve been told are worth having. I want as much as possible to give everyone the things they need to step forward because you can’t just wish everything into existence. That said, there’s something I love about the guy I like and it’s not something I’m ready to give away. I think a good number of gen z kids have good hearts and made good decisions but it will take a massive amount of energy to get them all good spots.",0,1

He also will blatantly insult or disrespect me when I won't let him get his way against the wishes of my grandfather who takes care of him.

1205,tryhc4,hope this is the right place for this.,"So I have this friend that I've know since secondary school who may been living in delusion, quite possibly for several years. Only pieced it together yesterday after my cousin found it strange and did some digging. Story time.

Going to call my friend D and the guys in this as story John, Bill and Greg. 

So back around 2017, I remembered wanting to reconnect with old friends. Found D on Facebook and we started talking. D tells me that she's been going out with this guy and that they've known each other since she was 14. His name was John. John worked as a martial arts instructor at a gym. He was also a cancer survivor currently in remission. Anyway, they have all sorts of celebrations, especially on valentines day. I've always wondered about the strong filters D always used on the photos. More to that later.

So suddenly, John and D break up. John drinks and takes drugs excessively and shares some of the photos he took at the club with me. The photos look staged. John and D get back together. John suddenly goes back home to the states and he decides to do legal euthanasia.

D is heartbroken and meets Bill. He is about 30 or 40 years her senior. They are happy for awhile until D finds that he hadn't been honest with her(Bill was trying to quit smoking, she found the cigarettes). She claimed Bill hit her. She wants to come home.

She comes home and gets together with John's best friend, Greg, who has had a thing with D since they dated when D broke up with John. They get married and post mushy stories on Facebook. 

I've always found it odd that John, Greg and D all type the same way when they chat with me. John is American and Greg is British and I'm pretty sure they pride themselves with a better command of English than bad grammar and broken texts. Also I and a few other people constantly get tagged to all their posts. 

It is now 2022 and I'm almost convinced almost everyone I've  said so far is fake. Greg is actually a gay British actor with a loving husband and two children. Every single photo of them(D and 'Greg') together has been weirdly cropped and a funky filter placed on top of it. Every time I ask to go out with them, she always has a reason to why they can't meet.

Out of all the guys I mentioned, I think Bill was the only real one. I mean all of us knew she went overseas and according to another friend, her Instagram suddenly lit up one day after being so quiet.

I am now seriously worried for her. I believe John and Greg are fake and she's living in a delusion probably way before I reconnected with her.

We can keep schizophrenia too, it's experienced by 70% of people!

You can't be schizophrenic. That's to say your disconnected narrative from schizophrenia is all that matters..

I finally cracked it, I finally figured it out. I know what schizophrenia is. It's when you believe things about your own mind and it produces a type of placebo effect sort of thing. Stop believing things about your brain and the characters inside it. That's why the persona fractures.

1218,n1ywab,Maybe Politically/Morally Incorrect but I need to express this,"I don't really get why everyone is against/actively preventing suicide. 

(disclaimer:this post is gonna be all over the place, it's not really meant to be a concise argument or anything like that. More like a journal entry/vent, that maybe someone can relate.) 

Well, I should say it's not as simple as that. I didnt always think like this. At all. I guess you gotta be in the situation yourself so you really understand it. I used to think everyone/most people could be helped and were making an impulsive decision in the moment, which they would most likely regret and affect everyone around them. And I still feel like that to a degree. There's people out there who are dealing with situational problems who sometimes aren't successful in their attempt and later down the line are very thankful it turned out that way. People should get access to the help they need, before they make such an important decision, especially if they're young.

However

I do feel like there are a lot of exceptions to that rule. I don't even wish to commit suicide necessarily, I most closely align to the ""death with dignity"" movement. People who are terminally ill, suffering from chronic pain or severe mental illnesses should be able to finally have some control over their lives. I'm not naive enough to think that it would totally ease the suffering of their loved ones, but I think it probably wouldn't be AS hard as it is, and it would prevent other issues like the trauma of someone discovering a suicide victim for example.

Luckily I didn't suffer from any mental illnesses in the past, and I was (for the most part) very lucky in my living situation (especially in comparison to other people), so the thought of suicide didn't ever cross my mind for a second. And it was great, my life was great. But now it's over. It's just a decline. I'm losing all my friends, all my hobbies, all my passions, all my relationships, my self esteem, my SANITY, etc. Not only am I losing them, I'm losing any hope whatsoever of gaining any semblance of any of it again. And since I'm only dealing with cognitive and negative symptoms (at least for now) I feel like I'm getting a front row seat to the desintegration of my own life. I'm only alive and writing this right now because I've been reading recently about suicide beaverament, and I really don't wanna put my mother through that. It's like I would be putting her in the position I am right now, and I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. 

But I feel like with this condition, it's just a different type of grief and mourning. It's like the person you love (can, not saying this is true for everyone) become a living dead, or a pod person like in the movie ""invasion of the body snatches"". It's like I'm on life support just so other people don't actively deal with the trauma of suicide. But I don't even feel like it would be ""suicide"" if I went through with it. Since I'm a schizophrenic, I'm pretty sure someone reading this might discredit my opinion as a delusion, etc. But I must say I honestly don't consider it as such. I feel like schizophrenia was what killed me already, and I'm just choosing to end the disease. It's like if you was driving, and another car inadvertedtly crashed into you, and people said it was suicide. Yeah you were driving the car so it could be considered your ""fault"" , rationally you could have taken another root or possibly avoided it, but no one would ever say that cause there was no way of knowing. It's like you were in control, but you weren't and couldn't possibly be. it's hard to explain.


Aside from what I've already said about not wanting to bring sorrow and sadness to my family, I'm not even afraid or resenting death anymore. I look at it differently now. Unfortunately im still pretty young (one of the most tragic traits of this illness) so I haven't lived much, but I'm so so proud and happy of the moments I had. I don't regret any of it, and I'm so thankful the people around me don't have to deal with any of this and will probably live on to have meaningful and fulfilling lives. But I won't. And that's OK. I'm OK with it now. Some people don't even get to live THIS long, and others go a lifetime without experiencing the joy I was lucky to have. It's really a question of quality of life VS quantity of life.

I know it's a very serious and severe illness so I'm not naive enough to think that it's easy to find solutions/research. But since there is currently NO help for cognitive/mood/negative symptoms I think it's pretty rational to assume my condition as hopeless. Im not too knowledgeable in other conditions, but I know there have been much better strides made over the years in illnesses such as depression, anxiety, even bipolar, etc. And that's great. Sincerely, I think that's great there's light for those people. But this is schiziphrenia. I don't wanna censor anyone else's opinion on the subject, but for me I always saw it as like.. Game over man. It's like it's just the body carrying on at this point. Like I said, I'm young and I'm not particularly looking forward to a life where the options/possibilities seem to be, homelessness, jail, group homes, stigma, psych wards, disability, etc. Like, Ive always been a very kind and friendly person and now even if I do manage to get the strength to bypass the negative and cognitive symptoms to get outside and try to enjoy the most simple pleasures of life, I might just become psychotic out of the blue and become dangerous? Just by existing?

Then there's the cliche notion of a suicidal person usually feeling like a ""burden"". I hear it a lot in people dealing with depression.  And maybe that's true, I don't know their particular situation. But most likely it's not, most likely you're functioning or even high functioning and instead of being dependant on people, you have people depending on you and maybe you're not even mistreating them because of your condition but you're actively taking care of them and they benefit of having you around. So maybe you're not a burden, but maybe life is a burden you have to carry on in order for other people to benefit from you VS damaging them with your absence. And even tho it's a whole lot harder than I'm making it seem, it's probably still  in your control to do that. But with schizophrenia, you're not in control. With schizophrenia depending on the ""lottery"" you got dealt with, maybe you're not high functioning, or even functioning at all. Maybe you re living on an institution or disability on tax payers dollars, or you need help in order to get the money for meds. Meds that also cost money, and induce or make the negative and cognitive symptoms worse, have other side fxs, and might not even work at all. Again, in most cases ""burden"" is not an apt description, and just an insecurity, but the word ""burden"" is factually a word on the dictionary and I find myself wondering if there aren't exceptions where that actually applies. I respect other people for saying that's not what is happening even if theyre just being condescending, but for myself I'm pretty sure that's rationally what I'm becoming. 


Now, this is the only part which I would be willing to classify as an delusion. I don't know if you've ever seen the movie Donnie Darko. It's always been one of my favorites. Anyway, the main character is described as possibly suffering from schizophrenia, and long story short in the end of the movie Donnie ultimately consciously sacrifices himself, and as a result the people around him are allowed to live, albeit without him. I feel like I'm in a weird place in time where I have insight into my probable future and although I can't say without a doubt what that will bring, I am assuming that my death might prevent me from enduring a lifetime of further suffering and maybe even prevent some of the downsides that I might cause other people, while unfortunately bringing some sadness from my absence. But unlike me, who is suffering from a lifelong chronic illness with no cure, there is a CHANCE they might recover and be able to move on with their lives. At least I wholeheartedly hope so and wish that for them. 


Ultimately, I won't make a decision if my condition and sanity doesn't keep degenerating and declining, where I become even more non functional, and the cons of my existence considerably outweigh the pros for the ones around me. And I wanna make clear that the situation I'm displaying here, totally does not apply to everyone who might read this, as ""unfortunately"" this illness is wholly unpredictable and considerably unique for anyone inflicted with it. I just wanted to express it since it's been on my mind for too long.


(ps: Im very grateful for places like this community. Aside from professionals/experts on the subject, other people aren't able/willing to empathize/understand with the situation. And I get it, I've been there. You can only see it one way, and you think we should save everyone even if they don't wanna be saved. One might even argue that people going through it aren't even cognisant enough to be able to advocate for it. However, for me it is precisely your opinion I think it's valuable. Not the person who has a ""crazy"" mother or brother who is now stuck in an institution or doesn't get brought to Thanksgiving anymore, while they're out they're dating and working and working out. I will respect someone who is ACTUALLY dealing with this and still disagrees.)",0,1

I have my pics online what's so different? well for sure I know I am talking to woman but they could all be controlled by men. so who knows. Online is so shady. how could I fall for the oldest trick in the book. If I play devils advocate and all is fair. These woman aren't woman aren't woman at all. the fact no video chat or phone chat for very long. Tells me they are not honest about who they are or their intentions. it seems to me I'm getting bambozzled and trying to believe that hot black woman love me. Because they are beautiful. But in turn. No woman has ever asked me for cash much less a black woman. a black woman has never even tryed to to talk me. Much less a mexican woman like me. So if we put two and two together then the woman I'm talking to are shams. If we are to believe real life.. And in reality real life is all that matters all this love dove stuff is just hot air. Unless they really make a real life move. so basically getting scammed thinking I'm the man cause black woman love me. I kidd you not if I drive around a big town and find a black woman try and talk to her guranteed her defenses will be up and she'll either hard ignore me or won't even care about me. soooo......Why would a woman who knows nothing about me just a pic tell me she loves me. I've proven this to be true because back in 2019 I did talk to a black woman she entertained me for a while but then she ignored me hard and avoided me like the plague. .....so not all women are the same but Why would Three black woman confess undying love for me. Real black woman. Don't love me that's far from the fact that's just my fantasy in my head. ...that I want to believe but when they Put the real black women the test it was nothing but shits tests and her ignoring me hard. she did not totally probably think I'm ugly but she was not intrested in me. so why would I believe some woman online who hasn't really show me themselves it all seems too good to be true then it probably is.

I'm just saying. The fact this black woman I met and talked to in 2019 actually reported me to police. and she made the police guy talk to me. shows me she really didn't want me to even look at her. but on what's app these woman can't stop talking to me. but the basis of the conversation is in fact money!

in real life I make black woman uncomfortable.

Some info: 15F dxd with suspected paranoid sz, asperger’s and unspecified anxiety disorder. Meds: abilify maintena LAI every 3 weeks and 25mg of clozapine daily

My main symptom besides anxiety is delusions of the paranoid/persecutory kind. Examples: my parents are going to kill me, they’re drugging my food... also conspiracy theory stuff like Illuminati/freemasons want to destroy all normal people. I’ve had these type of thoughts at least from age 11 ->

At age 12 I had a period of inflated self-esteem which is unusual to me since my self esteem is pretty low normally. Also I have really bad temper and instantly hit someone if they called me dumb or anything like that... 

My mom has thought I’m depressed many times... I didn’t feel depressed so I disagreed. 

I got suspended from a school when I was 13 because I hit my bullies (they bullied me since age 6)

I changed to another school and I started getting better grades until 9th grade... I still did well in school but my symptoms started with panic attacks or something resembling them. The physical symptoms got me a little hypochondriac... I visited the ER for physical complaints like chest pain etc but nothing was ever found.

Eventually the anxiety got to a point where I couldn’t sleep at home, worried of carbon monoxide or gas in the air. hence my admission to the psych ward

One ”episode” from age 13: i was visiting my grandma. They asked me to come eat something and I didn’t want to. They started ”dragging” me and I got angry instantly and was going to run outside but they stopped me and called me crazy etc shit blamed me for shit I did as a fucking toddler... they were going to call the police or an ambulance but I begged them not to do that and they didn’t...

I like programming, cybersec, philosophy, my PC. Following tests made IRL I do have moren than 149 IQ points, following internet tests and my own opinion I am an INTJ and I could be sadic and with antisocial troubles even if no one thinks it, evryone thinks I am just a kind of Einstein. If you see me IRL you'll just say ""This guy is super intelligent and very introverted, maybe strange"" 

IRL I do not really have friends, I've tryed before but they communicate as if communicating was the very purpose of their communication.

In fact, I don't really care about them and at best I ignore them, at worst they bother me. I point out that it is exactly the same for all members of my family. I use the internet a lot, especially the discords and 4chan. Even if it makes me laugh sometimes I find there also uninteresting people. Well, that was my little presentation: what I am, how I function socially.

The problem is that for about 4 weeks I have been crying every night at home for about an hour 20 to an hour 40 before sleeping.

I believe I have identified the cause of this shit: I believe that I feel alone. When I cry, I wonder why I am so different, why no one seems to suit me. I tried to sleep with my girlfriend in my arms but I wanted to physically hurt her (I already have sadistic behaviors during sex with her, she accepts it completely). For these few weeks, my sadistic impulses have intensified, I have developed a paranoia that comes periodically, I have become completely obsessed with cleanliness, I feel both empty and angry, I have done 3 episodes sleep paralysis.

I want to inspire people who either have schizophrenia or that look at it and pity the ones who have it. This is the thing that will give me psychosis again if anything..... it’s ridiculous just because I do drugs from time to time I can’t get diagnosed.

1252,96mveb,High Fat Ketogenic Diet More Effective than Pysch Drugs for Schizophrenia and Mental Health,"We have been told that fat is bad. But new research says the exact opposite. This conspiracy against fat has gotten a lot of press recently, but the benefits of a high fat diet are often overlooked. Maybe the most effective of these is the ketogenic diet. Sadly in today's world we all know people suffering from brain related disorders, Alzheimers, Parkinsons and even Autism.

The ketogenic diet was originally developed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1920s to stop seizures in children with epilepsy, when pharmaceutical drugs did not work. More recently, the ketogenic diet has been used successfully for neurological disorders such as [Alzheimer’s disease](https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/the-high-fat-ketogenic-diet-for-cognitive-health-proven-remedies-for-the-alzheimers-epidemic/).

Recently, there have been efforts by some researchers and medical practitioners to explore the potential of **ameliorating schizophrenia**, a major brain disorder that affects one out of a hundred, with the aid of the ketogenic diet. 

First, let’s make sure we understand what schizophrenia is about.  It’s not really the split or multiple personality types of syndrome many  consider it to be.

Here are major symptom descriptions which, if persistent and disabling, indicate one is schizophrenic: 

* Delusion: With [different manifestations](https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/delusion/) that are chronic, pronounced, and fiercely defended.
* Hallucinations: They can [manifest through any of the senses](https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/hallucination/) and be real only to schizophrenics.
* Disorganized speech patterns.
* Seriously disorganized outward behavior or the opposite – catatonic.
* Total disinterest in performing productive tasks to their conclusion.

Schizophrenic behavior is sometimes, but not usually, not aggressively violent unless provoked forcibly. Suicidal thoughts or impulses are more common. Most schizophrenics are victim oriented. [(Source)](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-symptoms/)  

The first three symptoms listed above are categorized as “positive  symptoms.” They involve subjective perceptions that nobody else is aware  of, or they demonstrate impulsive socially inappropriate activity.  Abilities lost, such as emotional expressiveness, interest in studies, work projects, and social skills are considered “negative symptoms.”  Both can exist simultaneously. [(Source)](https://www.livestrong.com/article/88264-areas-brain-affected-schizophrenia/)

## Recent Journal Publication Encourages Ketogenic Diet for Schizophrenia

The *Medical Hypothesis* journal published [*Ketogenic diet for schizophrenia: Nutritional approach to antipsychotic treatment*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037619) on June 20th, 2018. 

The purpose of this study is to raise awareness of the need for less  dangerous but more effective medication for this brain disease, because  so far, pharmaceutical drugs are causing more harm than good. 

Here’s the abstract abbreviated:

>Unfortunately, many schizophrenic patients suffer from persistent positive or negative symptoms that cannot be fully treated with available medication. (….) there is **evidence** on dopaminergic transmission defects, there is a need to find a more  holistic way in treating the disease and a diet regimen could be one of  them. (…) **The key mechanism is to generate ketosis**. … Possible  hypothesis can be that ketogenic diet changes the ratio of GABA:  glutamate in favor of GABA, … and furthers the **increase of GABA** … to compensate the disrupted GABA levels in the schizophrenic brain, (…) \[Emphasis added\] [(Source)](https://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877%2818%2930471-7/fulltext)

Keywords are evidence and increase of GABA, which is the commonly used acronym for gamma-aminobutyric acid. **GABA is an amino acid that is not a building block for protein.  It acts an inhibitory neurotransmitter to slow things down a bit before the brain spins out of control and burns out.**

Most GABA is created in the body by breaking down glutamate, which is a neurotransmitter that functions like other neurotransmitters:  adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Those all accelerate neuron firing. [(Source)](http://overcomingyouranxiety.net/naturalanxietyremedies/gaba-for-anxiety/)

So, the “evidence” referred to in the study abstract are other studies related to the same topic of brain or nervous system inflammation and biochemical imbalance reduction from ketogenic dieting.  They also mention how **“increasing GABA” production in the brain leads to improved mental health.**

Here are a few samples of those other studies that explore the ketogenic diet’s effect on neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate: 

### [Ketogenic diet reverses behavioral abnormalities in an acute NMDA receptor hypofunction model of schizophrenia](https://research.jcu.edu.au/bmdt/publications/publications-1/kraeuter-et-al-schizophrenia)

### [Ketogenic diet, brain glutamate metabolism and seizure control ](https://www.plefa.com/article/S0952-3278%2803%2900218-7/fulltext)

## Beyond GABA: Ketogenic Dieting Builds Brain Matter

In addition to insufficient GABA to regulate neurotransmitters, there is an obvious matter of measurable brain mass loss **among schizophrenics, up to 25 percent loss of brain gray matter has been observed** with CT scans and MRIs. 

**Mainstream medicine has finally conceded that it is possible for the brain to regenerate cells of all types but insists on creating synthetic pharmaceutical drugs for high profits that often do more harm than  good.** [**(**Source)](https://www.healthyplace.com/thought-disorders/schizophrenia-effects/schizophrenia-brain-impact-of-schizophrenia-on-the-brain)

The ketogenic diet involves a high-fat diet with moderate meat consumption and low grains. Up to [80 percent of one’s caloric intake](https://healthimpactnews.com/2014/ketogenic-diet-improves-insulin-sensitivity-and-numerous-aging-markers/)  could be from mostly healthy saturated fats such as virgin coconut oil,  cold-pressed olive and organic seed oils, whole organic or raw milk, real butter, cheese, codfish and other seafood oils, walnuts, and eggs from free roaming chickens. [(Source)](https://healthimpactnews.com/2016/best-foods-for-boosting-brain-power/)

The brain comprises only 2% of the body’s total weight, yet it  contains nearly 25% of the total cholesterol (which is NOT inherently bad) in the body. Gray matter in different areas of the brain is where most neurons exist that determine  cognitive skills, memory, planning, and recognizing environmental similarities and differences. 

The growth or regrowth of gray matter cells depends on the amount of fatty acids available. This is a major reason why a high fat diet is so beneficial. A high fat ketogenic diet provides more fatty acids to build the brain and help it recover from neurons damaged by injury or disease.

# Cholesterol =  vital for creating strong synapse connections among neurons. 

Nerve fibers used to transmit signals among the different gray matter lobes, some frontal and others mid-brain, are white matter. 

Myelin sheaths protect the white matter nerve fibers with insulation that protects the fibers and enhances neurotransmitter speed. Myelin sheaths are composed of fatty acids and cholesterol that protect the nerve fibers connecting various gray matter lobes with specific functions as well as connecting to the central nervous system network throughout the body. [(Source)](https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/the-high-fat-ketogenic-diet-for-cognitive-health-proven-remedies-for-the-alzheimers-epidemic/)

Schizophrenics and other brain and central nervous system disorders can be treated with the ketogenic diet. Supplements that also help the brain recover from defects that should be taken with a ketogenic diet include magnesium, vitamins B1, B6, B12, B9 (as folate not folic acid).  Vitamin B3 (niacin) is very useful but preferably monitored by a  holistic medical practitioner familiar with [Orthomolecular psychiatry.](http://www.orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v01n11.shtml) [(Source)](https://www.livestrong.com/article/248779-how-to-use-diet-as-a-treatment-for-schizophrenia/)

1257,8i9ogu,Had an anxiety attack because I know I have schizophrenia,"PLEASE HEAR ME OUT:
I'm 14, I have anxiety and OCD.  If you've read my previous post about ""auditory hallucinations"" you would know that I get these random intrusive phrases either in my voice,  my family or friends voice saying random phrases that constantly pop into my head. (But not when I'm at school) and I used to get intrusive images at night (I don't get them anymore). The ""voices"" don't usually say anything insulting or command me to do stuff, and sometimes it's just bits of music or conversations I've heard earlier on in the day. They usually happen when I'm alone or not going anything intense, but I was on the internet and I found that these are called ""mind pops"" but mine aren't about memories. I found that they are common in people with anxiety and OCD, but I've found they are even more common in people with schizophrenia. And there were 3 articles that showed experiments done by professors that proved they are common in people with schizophrenia, and develop into auditory hallucinations later on. I had a huge anxiety attack because I've been worrying I might have schizophrenia for the past 5 months and I experience mind pops ALL the time. Everybody else said they experience them about 4 times a week, but I experience at least 31 each day, and they get worse and I get more of them when I worry and obsess over them. After reading that article I had the worst panic attack I've ever had, I started crying for about 2 hours knowing that I'm crazy. After reading that article about a million phrases and sentences popped into my mind each minute. They usually aren't just words, (like others) mine are usually sentences, and they sometimes are unintelligible or sometimes never finish what they were saying, and they usually don't make any sense, and are loosely associated with what I'm doing. They say stuff like ""where's the cat on handlebars"" or some completely random stuff. They are SO annoying. I worry that soon they will develop into auditory hallucinations, I felt as if my future and my dreams went down the drain, and I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with this shitty fucking illness.

1258,7rnqg6,Husband with schizophrenic brother,"So my husband has a brother with schizophrenia. My husband has taken it upon himself to help him socialize a bit, he goes out to the bar with him, where his brother mainly goes to play pool and he's the designated driver. They usually get home from 3:am to 5:something. Anyway, his brother usually spends the night, of course,in the living room. But my daughter (14) has been feeling some unwanted attention by her uncle with schizophrenia.. Her room is next to the living room. Her body of course has been changing,growing into a young lady and I was also starting to notice some extra attention towards her from him, but I didnt know how to go about it, since he has schizophrenia. I didn't want to upset him, it scared me. So I told my husband that his brother cannot spend the night here anymore. My husband said that his brother would never do something to our daughter.He wanted to just talk to him about it and to continue the same routine of every other Friday his brother spending the night. And I said, totally not! I believe that prevention is better than taking a risk. And just so you know, he is a narcissist and I'm an introvert. It's just that he makes me feel like if I'm crazy and exaggerating for acting the way I did. Please people tell me I'm not crazy. I'm just trying to take care of my daughter! ",0,1
1259,7l7iad,"So liek, how does being schizo effect your ability to have relationships? Personally.","I don't know what I am, specifically. I hate doctors. I don't go to them. But I know that I hallucinate, and I haven't been caught in any delusions yet, so I think I'm okay. Feels like these things are pushed far enough back on the burner for me not to need to think about it too much. 

I've had relationships but they were never healthy. My longest one I fully believe my ex was trying to gaslight me. I know that makes it sound like *I'm* crazy, but she was a massive narcissist. Violent, explosive, I am sure as hell not the only one who saw this. She used my mental issues (and every other issue I had) against me at every opportunity.

It got to the point where I started to buy into it, and believed that I was worse off than I was. But it's strange, because I don't have those types of problems with literally anyone else in my life. Never. Nobody I know would know anything about my hallucinations if I hadn't told them. I bet if I never told this woman, she wouldn't have either.

But it's got me worried. There's that ""What if?"" in the back of my mind. That nagging voice. I don't know who would want to love the man that my ex made me out to be. I know I'm not that, but how much of it might be true? I think it's easier to just be alone forever or kill myself than to worry about all that nonsense. Not that I ever would. I'm too optimistic for that. It just seems easier. When I think about my future, I see work ahead. ",0,1

1264,4p9rol,What does it feel like to develop Schizophrenia?,"People always look for signs and symptoms on the internet as a ruminative activity, and perhaps posting this is an activity of the same nature. But few ever report what it feels like at the onset of symptoms. I know it's very different from person to person, but what did it feel like for YOU, when you started developing symptoms?

In case you haven't noticed, I am worried about my mind. I've been experiencing really intense anxiety lately, but it's been different from my normal OCD anxiety. (I was diagnosed at like, 12, been experiencing symptoms my whole life) Like, when it hits I get really confused. It's odd. All the things going on around me feel way too loud, and I start to feel derealized. It's hard to explain. Like, everything just feels 'off'. I feel restless and like I'm developing dementia or something. The TV is always too loud, but then I turn it down slightly and it's too quiet, and such things like that. It feels like there's a bug in my brain and it's crawling around and shit. And I'm not sure if it's in my head or if it's real, but I've been experiencing some mild hallucinations. Very mild. Like, seeing black spots on things, but then I look at said thing and it's gone. Usually thinking it's a bug or something. Or my vision looks like it's sliding really really slowly. Like in those crappy reality movies where you can tell the camera is being held by someone and not on a stand or whatever, but less so. And the other night I couldn't sleep, and I took a caffeine shot and as it was kicking in I was sitting in my kitchen alone, completely silent house, and I started to hear really faint mumbling. Like a male with a booming voice speaking over a radio wayyy in the other room. I couldn't make it out, but it got to the point that I checked multiple times to see if I left my TV on in my room, or if my phone was playing some audio I didn't know about. And there's another thing that's gonna be a little hard to talk about, but I'm having really really strong anxiety (paranoia?) that I'm developing dementia. Like, often times I feel absolutely convinced that I'm developing dementia and that I'm dying. Like, a doctor could give me a brain scan and send me off with a clean bill of health and I wouldn't believe him. This is usually what causes previously stated episodes of severe anxiety and dissociation. This is usually when the hallucinations start to get more frequent. Not more intense, but like, less spaced out and I notice them a lot more, to the point that I stare at walls and blank surfaces to see if they're there. The audio hallucinations aren't really persistent or common, the other day was the first time I'd really experienced them without the use of substances (diphenhydramine, fun shit). Also, lately I haven't been able to fucking sleep. Which is why I'm posting this at 4:30 in the fucking morning. Night before last was an all-nighter, hence why I took aforementioned caffeine shot. Horrible idea. Anxiety was out of this world. Great stimulant kick though. 

My mother claims to have hallucinations occasionally, hearing screams in the house while she's alone in her room. And she talks about killing people sometimes when she's drunk. Though I think this could just be pent up stress releasing itself through the alcohol. She doesn't know if my dad was schizophrenic or not. He was pretty fucked up, he was extremely physically and emotionally abusive towards her. However, my half-sister on his side is a diagnosed schizophrenic. I am not sure if any other people in my family on either side are schizophrenic. I know it's only first-degree family that significantly increases probability of it, but still. It should be said that I used to be a frequent cannabis user (stopped using due to anxiety). Never used any psychedelic drugs. I used diphenhydramine at medium to high doses a handful of times, and wonder if some of the hallucinations are simply HPPD caused by it, though this was many months ago. I recently got over an addiction to kratom (google it if you've never heard of it), and the symptoms really didn't start until I quit that shit. The withdrawals were sheer fucking hell, worse than opiate withdrawals have ever been for me. The physical withdrawals and severe anxiety and depression are mostly gone, as in, I can no longer feel the symptoms of withdrawal. But I still experience severe anxiety and depression, it just doesn't feel withdrawal-induced. It's hard to explain, just trust me. 

I digress, what do you think? Tell me about your experiences developing Schizophrenia. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just telling you my experiences as of recently and looking to compare and contrast, plus I'm just interested.

1265,4kv9lc,Anxiety or Schitz?,"Hey guys, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to discuss this in, but I wanted to write about some of my experiences and see if I am fine, or if I have onset schizophrenia. 
So, my experiences first came up when I took acid and I had a very very bad trip. I felt like i was losing my mind. I had no control over my brain, and felt like a man who needed to go to a mental hospital. After my bad trip, the next couple of days i felt very horrible for people who had schizophrenia because for a couple hours I felt like how they felt to a degree (I felt like something was controlling my brain, and it wasnt me.). I couldnt imagine having the disease all my life, and it really scared me. 
Continuing on, I developed anxiety and even had some anxiety attacks weeks later (due to family issues). When I had anxiety attacks I felt like I was going insane, delusional even. I couldnt handle it. Then at some nights I would be so anxious that I felt like I could even have schizophrenia, I became so worried I would have this disease and it would just blow up my anxiety. However, later I figured out I believed it was just me being stupid thinking so.
Yet, now I am getting a little more nervous that something is wrong with me. My anxiety is flaring a little bit right now I must admit. However, last night I got smoked pot with my best friend and I looked up at the stars and I asked my friend if he ever got scared of the galaxy. For some reason I got scared just how incredibly big the galaxy was, and i felt almost non human like. I felt like I was just some speck, and felt like I was nothing, and its really hard to explain but I felt just extremely out of it. I felt loopy. And previously that day I watched a video about how big the universe is, and it made me feel extremely out of touch with life. 
Today, I am now sitting in my bed, and my head feels oddly cold and i dont know if its my anxiety that is making me feel like im just out of touch with reality, or if its onset schizophrenia or some other mental illness. I dont hear voices, I dont have many of the symptoms that I read on the internet, but I just feel like something is wrong. I feel like my brain is a little.... off.

Tomorrow she is coming back because she need to take her clothes I don't really want to break up with her. I love her and I am so lonely I will be alone at this new year if we break up.
How can I help her? I am from Russia and psychiatry here is very bad I scared that she will kill herself because of me. I am trapped in what is essentially an abusive relationship.",0,1

1270,3bbrug,"Do I sound Schizophrenic, should I be worried?","Firstly, I'm 21 years old and this is a throwaway, for obvious reasons. Lately I've been experiencing some mild hallucinations, mostly voices, but only before bed or when I wake up in the middle of the night. I often wake up thinking someone is talking to be and I'll hear my name or something. I sort of brush it off as sleepiness or something. But what really had me concerned is my paranoia. Especially with food. Just this morning my mom woke me up asking if I wanted a sandwich and I thought ""Yeah that sounds great, breakfast in bed"" but when she brought it to be I couldn't bring myself to eat it because I thought it was poisoned. And I was examining the orange juice too, to make sure I didn't see or smell anything unusual. This isn't the first time i've done that, it's been happening more lately. my dad will make steaks or something and I think he did something to them or that it's not what he's telling me it is. Or if I'm with friends I'll perceive them as acting strangely, if they are holding scissors or something I become paranoid that they want to hurt me. I make sure they don't get behind me and that I'm always facing them. The thing is, while it feels very real in the moment, like I won't eat the food or whatever because i'm entirely convinced it's poisoned or made of cat or something, afterwords I will usually realize how silly I was being. And I can convince myself that I was being paranoid and silly. Which makes me think not Schizophrenia?

1276,102snvn,i fight god," 

I have been diagnosed with psychosis. I don't believe my psychosis to be psychosis. Heres why. I know I'm talking to god.

There's a phenomenon called ESP, aka Extra Sensory Perception where you challenge the voice in your head. The idea here is that god lives within your subconscious to watch and rule over your life. The thoughts your subconscious generates, are intractable. Your subconscious perceives what you say, understands it, and responds. That's why I believe the brain holds another sentient being. Otherwise, when you talk to yourself, a voice wouldn't be there to respond to you. I ended up doing esp so much, that god ended up taking over in my body. I can orally talk to god by letting the words play out of my mouth. I've been doing this since march. One of the first things I was told by god, was he told me this.

""I am the band seether""

This is because I was listening to music and I stumbled upon the band. I really didn't think much of it. It didn't strike me as anything but a joke. Until I found a song a couple of months later.

Words As Weapons - Seether.

This song is shitty for a god, which isn't surprising for the god I talk to. He's genuinely mean-spirited and looking to send us to hell. I'm being honest when I say it, this is a phenomenon. Other people have been known to talk to god like I do. Shinedown, Godsmack, Fozzy, The Score, etc. I'm writing here on [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psycosis/)schitzophrenia because im looking for others who believe what I believe. I'm looking for people who fight god. I'm looking for a teammate. Every god has a partner, and I know what it will take to kill the gods with a swift kick in the balls.

1277,znbuxn,Will I still get high from weed on 2.5 mg of olanzapine/Zyprexa,"Sorry to intrude on your forum, friends. I'm depressed not schizophrenic.

The only thing that helps my chronic pain is cannabis. I'm thinking of going on 2.5 mg olanzapine as advised by doc, at which dose it's mostly an antidepressant (but I believe also used for negative symptoms of schizophrenia).

I think I should still get a reasonable high at this dose because dopamine blocking effects are somewhat low, but I'm afraid I won't get high at all, and it's the high that mostly helps me forget about the pain (while also reducing it).

Don't want to encourage any of you to consume cannabis, but perhaps some of you have tried it at this low dose of olanzapine.

1293,56kd0o,My neighbor probably has schizophrenia. Should I be worried? Because I am. What should I do?,"There is a TLDR at the bottom.

My wife and daughter recently moved into a great apartment (about 1 month ago). We are on the second floor above an older woman (probably about 50-60) who lives by herself. Her daughter was living with her for a few weeks. The first night our daughter didn't sleep well and was making some noise at night.  She mentioned it to us and we got her on a better sleep schedule. We thought everything was fine. A police officer came to our door a few nights and asked if we heard any suspicious noises next door. I wasn't alarmed by this because our next door neighbors had been evicted and periodically came by to  pick up stuff. Anyway, she continued to complain about the noises she was supposedly hearing. She came to the inner door that connects our apartments and yelled by wifes name. My wife talked to her for awhile. I was watching our daughter and attempting to listen in. I was later told that she said some strange things. She said that my daughter knows where her electronic devices are and jumps up and down above them.

One morning, as I was walking by the door that connects her apartment to ours, I heard her scream out three names. It was like she was attempting to talk to me, but those were not my names. I considered responding, but something about the way she yelled creeped me out. So I ignored it. 

She often manages to be outside smoking a cigarette and would talk to my girlfriend and ask he questions about our situation. She surprised her when she said we were still making too much noise and she couldn't sleep. She said she only occasionally sleeps. There have been a few times when our daughter woke up in the middle of the night, but she was sleeping through most nights. It seemed odd to us, but it wasn't a big deal.

She continued to occasionally mention the noises to my wife. A few nights ago my wife brought our daughter down to the car and the woman came out and walked between our cars while I was still inside. When I came down I saw her standing in the darkness. She didn't say anything. It was like she didn't want to be noticed. It was creepy. I said ""Hi!"" and she came over and asked if we heard any noises or knew what was going on in the apartment next door. The neighbors had moved out, but there was a light on now. We thought the landlord probably left it on. There is a lock on the door and an eviction notice too. [She had told as it was a restraining order. When we told her it was an eviction notice. We had read it. She told us we were wrong. She also told us that those neighbors would bang on her windows to scare her] She asked if we had any ""companions"" left in our apartment. When I didn't immediately answer, she asked if my wifes mother was in our apartment. Sure she had visited twice when we first moved in. I thought the question was odd.  As we drove away she was attempting to unlock the door to the inner stairs on the opposite end of the house from where she lives. The stairs lead to the two the apartments. It was strange. 

When we came back there were three police cars parked in front of the house. As we walked past, we heard them talking to he about noises and voices. We listened from upstairs. The police we asking if she often hears voices. I couldn't hear her answer. My girlfriend heard them ask her about her medication. If  she would like to go to the hospital. The next night there was knocking at our door. It was the police again. The asked if we were yelling or if we heard anyone yelling. The reason this is bizarre is that our daughter had been sleeping. We were in the next room being quiet because we didn't want to wake her.  Later that night, as we were leaving, she came out and asked what me what the commotion was. I told her I have no idea what she was talking about and she seemed upset and ran inside. I wanted to ask her more questions. But maybe I should stay away from her. 

We called the police and told them she is crazy and sort of harassing us, but they said there is nothing they can do. They did imply that she has a history of this and has never done anything violent, but we should call if we feel in danger.

I'm convinced she is insane. What should I do? Is she dangerous? If you are schizophrenic, do you do this sort of thing? Could you give me any advice? 


TLDR:

Our neighbor hears yelling and voices. Some of her statements are also very strange. We are concerned about our safety.

I'm an actual genius and I know what that means to say that on the internet.  People don't believe me, or they want to argue about the definition of genius, and they say every test you've ever taken didn't actually measure intelligence because they don't like the idea that they might not be the smartest person in the conversation.

Whatever.

Believe it, don't believe it.  I went off my meds for a week before taking a few tests for entrance to Mensa.  I didn't really want to join Mensa (although I did for two years to give it a shot), but I was concerned that my own assumption of my brain power was due to delusions of grandeur so I wanted a legit testing.

I had to go off the meds because on the meds, I feel like I'm running in mud when I try to think on real tough stuff.  There's a book called Meditations by a Greek philosopher named Marcus Aurelius.  It's heavy, heavy stuff.  The line that has me thinking now is: Away from thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will not be; but as even now ready to die, think little of they flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and twisted work, consisting of nerves, veins, and arteries; think no more of it, than so.

I've read it on and off my meds.  It's clear as day off my meds but on them, I need to break up the sentence into pieces, then form those pieces into a whole.

There's an upside too, though it sounds insulting.  When I've got my brain running on all cylinders, I'm a real asshole.  Your average conversation is a little dull to an average intelligence, but it's a hammer to the brain to someone with an oddity like mine.  On the meds though, I can just sit, and chill, and have a conversation.  I can be genuinely interested in what they have to say even knowing that it's going to banal.

I know the tradeoff is mostly IQ for sanity, but I kind of like not firing on all pistons, too.  I take adderall when I want to write a book or something and I get most of the genius back without the mad bits.  But even though I have the prescription for everyday, I only take it when I'm going to do something real intellectual.  I even do lectures without it just so the stupid questions don't bother me.  Everyone still considers me a genius, but I know I'm capable for so much more.  I don't want to go off the pills.  I just want people to know that if I did, as clever as I am, there were still pistons to fire.",1,1

The weed is a major factor because my spiral downwards is overthinking and continuing a bad habit i know is bad for me. It was overthinking to the point i lost touch with reality and I had thought i had maybe ‘overcome’ that big episode i had, in reality, i just came back in about 6 months, so now, ive smoked to the point where i heard a voice masked as my moms voice and this happened at 1032 at night and i thought she was trying to come in to wash her teeth. i had music playing and i heard in my moms voice Glenn can I enter in my moms voice in spanish and I yelled out “si puedes entrar!” Since i got so high today that I cant recall how high pitched it sounded and i cleared my throat before i said it.

The voices are just the urge to take a shit. But got erased for some reason due to low s*x life.

Her presence made me uncomfortable from the beginning. Not only because she was crippling along us with her crutches while we headed upstairs (from -2nd to 2nd floor) to our classroom, but the way she talked, the words she said... I can't understand why.

She was so untalented. I don't even know why she was there, she hindered our work. She asked stupid questions, completely unrelated to the subject, made weird commentaries on our pictures, etc.

But we were tolerant, we were there for learning and practising.

One time I chose a difficult topic for my pictures: my mental illness, schizotypal disorder. (To be honest, I'm not sure if it's the correct diagnosis because my doctor said that it can be an other psychosis related thing, but I needed to take antipsychotics. Eventually I had to stop the treatment since she left and I couldn't find another doctor.)

R. said that she has schizophrenia too, and we started to chat a bit about out experiences. She said that she only experienced minor hallucinations like seeing eyed floating around and hearing voices. She takes several pills, like three our four everyday. She still goes to secondary school even though she's 24 years old.

In the meanwhile I studied about a poet's son who was probably schizophrenic, and another poet who even wrote about his schizophrenia. I read his diary and found similarities whith my notes I took when I felt unwell. I also watched the movie about Louis Wain, and I can't take it. I don't want to relate to them but I still do.

Ever since sometimes I have panic attacks when I think about schizophrenia. I don't want to end up like her. I don't want this burden, I'll rathe die by my own hands. I'm so afraid that one day I'll lose touch with reality and become one of those stereotypical psychotics like in Dürrenmatt’s The Physicists.

he's been in an Israeli psych hospital for 7 weeks. i know very little of his status except what my mom says, and shs does not have a very good grip on reality. she's delusional when it comes to him.

it seems like my moms willing to sacrifice everything for my brother.

well, he's supposed to be deported to us in less than 2 weeks now. we don't know if he has violent thoughts or if he has had violent command hallucinations. we don't know if he wants to re-enact Abraham's covenant with god and kille his own son to prove his faith.

we know almost nothing because he, for the first time in 25 years of this nightmare, has refused to allow the psychiatrist to discuss information about him with my mother.

also, my mom has been under such EXTREME stress that she had to be emergently hospitalized for broken heart syndrome -- literally when the human is under SUCH SEVERE emotional distress that thejr heart fails. she is ok but she could have died and has a long road to rexovery.

for perspective this is a condition I've seen in Ukrainian refugees whose homes have been bombed and families killed. (i am a nurse.). that's how intensely stressful this has been for her. 

that doesn't mean she's got a grip on reality though.

I was talking to one of my friends about my hallucinations and how often they occured, and I thought that was a normal thing. Apparently not. They told me to consider how it might be linked to mental illness, and that was when the panic started. I was like “ah hell nah” at first because I thought there was no way, so I looked up reasons for hallucinations. None of them could possibly be the reason except for mental conditions, so I decided to take a couple tests online as a guide into the right direction to just make sure that wasn’t the reason either. High score on schizophrenia and on bipolar disorder. So the panic started up once again.

I decided to do research on both, schizophrenia first because I’ve heard of how terrifying the disorder can be and I wanted to make sure I didn’t have it. But I relate to nearly all of the symptoms. I had a checklist and everything. I checked tiktoks explaining the disorder, along with people with the disorder talking about their experience. Related to majority of it.

I did more research and figured out that schizophrenia came in stages. Just so you all know, I’m 13 (turned 13 last month). So I looked into the prodrome stage. Now it’s gotten more messy. Suddenly, my personality did a flip. When i was younger (like elementary school young), I was a social butterfly. I had a lot of friends, I loved talking to people, I had no trouble making friends. But then, during fifth grade, I suddenly switched up to the pure opposite. And ever since then, I’ve barely talked to anyone (in real life at least), not a single person (except for one, and even then we still don’t talk often). All I want to do is be on my own. I don’t know what happened.

And thats not the only thing. I never feel the need to be expressive anymore. Sometimes, I don’t feel a thing emotion-wise, but most of the time I do feel normally, I just never express it. Like for example, whenever me and my family go places or have parties, I never smile or even look like I’m having fun, even though sometimes I truly am. And then there’s when I’m sad, I don’t express that either. I wore my heart on my sleeve when I was younger, so once again, I don’t know what happens.

And then there’s the delusions. I think my first one was last year. I’m not sure if it’s a normal delusion people have or not, but I somehow convinced myself that everyone in my school was in my house, stuck in it. And not walking around freely, they were chained to the walls. By their arms. Side by side. I’m so srs. And I swore that I could hear them talking to eachother, and/or begging for me to let them free, but I couldn’t. I tried to sit and ignore them but it was so hard. And it got to the point where during school hours, I observed everyone to see if they acted weird around me because I couldn’t tell if they remembered being stuck in my house. I genuinely couldn’t tell if it was real or not, and every day I came back from school, the cycle continued until it eventually stopped. It was genuinely one of the most terrifying experiences of my life when I was going through it, but looking back at it I’m not sure how the hell it got that bad.

And that’s not the only delusion I’ve had, but I’m probably not gonna share the rest of them right this minute. Just note that those arent the only symptoms I show. There’s the hallucinating (obviously), the lack of concentration, not feeling like a real human being, the paranoia, the god awful lack of self hygiene, the trouble with speech, and that STILL isn’t all!

Maybeee I’m fine. I’m barely even 13 anyway, and it’s extremely rare for people my age to have schizophrenia. I might be good. But I don’t know. The dots connect way too well, plus it’s not completely impossible. I heard so many stories about how terrifying schizophrenia can get and now I might have it and I’m terrified?? HELP?? What do I do in this situation... I’m not even sure how long it’ll be before I can get actual help for all of this so I’m super stuck",0,1

1310,yq3hhj,Thinking I may be on the spectrum,"Hi, I’m 16F and my psychologist thinks my behaviors may indicate something deeper. I have an extreme lack of desire to have social relationships and feel no attachment to people. It isn’t that it makes me anxious I just feel completely unfazed by connection. In general I just have an apathetic personality. I usually feel situational and behavioral emotions, rather than with interactions with people. For example, I feel happy when it’s the weekend or I ace an exam, but if someone were to compliment me I would feel absolutely nothing. My psychologist mentioned the term “avolition” and upon researching this term many of the sources were in relation to schizophrenia. I do not experience visual or auditory hallucinations, but I’ve had delusions in the past such as believing my school bully was coming to my house to harm me, and more general delusions such as thinking I am just a soul in a body doing tasks rather than experiencing emotion that goes along with daily life. I had a really bad derealization episode once at a museum with my family, where I saw everyone looking at the art pieces and being so interested by them and I felt absolutely nothing. I felt like I was incapable of feeling so profoundly about anything. 
I also frequently experience paranoia especially at night, and I am afraid to open my eyes because I am scared of seeing figures in the dark even though I don’t think I would. I don’t know if this constitutes as a hallucination but I have an extreme phobia of the sun as well and when I went outside at work (I rarely ever do) I felt like my skin was burning and experienced a lot of discomfort and itching. I should also mention that I have OCD and some of my compulsions may tie into delusional thinking, like something bad will happen if I don’t repeat certain phrases in my mind at certain times. Btw, I have never used drugs.",1,1
1311,vlhca6,"Hello. I saw the welcome bot’s message and decided to introduce myself, so here we go:","I am a 14 year old girl, struggling with mental health problems such as SPD, ADHD, BPD, Anxiety, Depression, Anorexia, Autism and Schizophrenia.

I am also an Empath, which makes my Schizophrenia worse, because not only do I have my own voices in my head, I hear other peoples thoughts in my head as well, and I can’t really tell which is which anymore. 

There’s a voice that wants me dead, I call it Dylan (after my father, who was an abusive alcoholic. My mother left him when I was young, but from what she tells me, I’m sure that if she didn’t, he would’ve abused me and my brother as well)

She has had for a long time, since like a year that she claims to see faces or people sitting in my room when we’re at ours, she recently told me aswell that she hears sometimes laughing inside her head, and yesterday she heard something like ”They walk slowly.”

She also matches many of the early schizophrenia signs, such as weird word usage or weird thoughts about words and a very negative reaction to criticism, also sometimes when she is mad she laughs instead of raging like her brain doesnt know how to react to the situation, could be just her brain trying to relieve itself from the anger.

1319,ozbw2e,Being undiagnosed and knowing the hurdles,"It doesn't get easy I'll say that. But for those like me who know what living with schizophrenia is? Why have a doctor tell you what you've already known to be true?

But there are days that just having a therapist would be helpful, but it doesn't work that way when you express the use of psychedelics. And I'm sorry to those who've entrusted themselves to the medical world. You've done so because you needed to or were made to. I stand by your health to be better.

But to live with schizophrenia... Takes the life out of you. You become very removed from the world. Some days you just break down in tears because you feel the world barreling down even though nothing is happening. I never stood by assertions of MD or BP or BPD because those people can chose to stop. Schizophrenia? It doesn't go away.

It's always been there. Few in my family have had dementia or schizophrenia so I'm not afraid. Some would sure I can imagine. It's not easy because you are at the mercy of your own thoughts and actions. A part of tries to live this way because eventually I will become stronger than myself is now and be able to hold myself together.

Just some days? The overwhelming sense of retreat. To hide away and just cry and huddle in a ball stuck in a closet hoping the screaming stops. I haven't done that in 7yrs, but I'd hide away in the darkest of places because eventually it'd be night out and the fears were gone. But now? It's all ptsd driven. There's no voices other than my own mind. I've come full circle in certain aspects.

Yet I've reverted back into someone I'd forgotten who they were as a child or teenager. It's scary for me to have a sense of youth lost. It's fun to accept what I've missed and who I am. Just it sucks doing it alone. Yes, i have you here online. But in the real world I've got no one. Imagine just staring at walls and sighing and having conversations that will never exist while you're imaging this person hears you. It isn't so and we now that.

To smile requires more effort than people care to accept. For me smiling is like lifting 500lbs dead weight. It's a struggle and i feel like a rape victim having to present myself in a happy mindset so that others don't get sad and feeling down. 

Sigh... Maybe some day there will be a calm to the storm. Maybe some day I find my place in this world. Maybe I'll be with someone who won't run away. ✌",0,1

1326,fg51mv,"So like, I think I figured out the cause of schizophrenia","Or at least a large portion of those diagnosed with it. I’m not suggesting any specific diet changes or that this is the only set of causes and am talking strictly from a physical cause point of view of how I believe it could happen. And it’s a bit of a long read, but I’ve been putting together information for a while for my own purposes and thought I’d share what I found. I also have no formal education in any form or neuroscience of medicine so this is like... just what I think:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My belief is that some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may have type 1 diabetes, and gluten sensitivity. Humans with type 1 diabetes are more likely to be diagnosed with celiac disease, which is the extreme version of gluten insensitivity and there’s also been reported cases of psychosis caused by celiac disease along with an old study where mental health admittance had a correlation with wheat based bread supply in a population. 

All three would be caused by a virus, that causes the destruction of insulin cells and bacteria that digest carbohydrates in the stomach, due to having the same signature that immune cells detect and destroy after acquiring the signature of and destroying the virus cells. The lack of bacteria to digest the carbohydrates in the stomach could cause gluten based compounds to be too large to get through the stomach lining compared to gluten on its own causing build up on the stomach lining. The buildup would prevent nutrients from being properly absorbed in the stomach such as the gluten itself being a protein and other proteins. 

The lack of insulin cells prevents glucose from leaving the bloodstream, but since puberty has already happened in most cases of schizophrenia, the extra glucose could be converted to fructose in the gonads for sperm whereas in type 1 diabetes, the higher blood sugar level causes insulin shock because puberty has often not occurred yet. The lack of available energy in the former case causes fat to be used instead, and since fat is often not enough for higher energy demands, and glycogen stores can’t be used, protein is used instead. 

The coating on the stomach lining from undigested gluten could  prevent the appropriate supply of protein for extra energy so various muscles such as the myelin sheath in the brain are broken down for protein. The myelin sheath insulates nerve cells, meaning the lack of the sheath could cause electrical signals to interfere leading to psychosis. Antipsychotics can lower brain activity to prevent interference through the alteration of dopamine and serotonin, but also have secondary effects such as in paliperidone which increases insulin sensitivity. 

Since usually only most of the insulin producing cells are destroyed in type 1 diabetes, not all, increasing insulin sensitivity means less insulin could be more effective. Types 1 diabetes is often diagnosed before puberty, while schizophrenia is diagnosed after puberty. Those with type 1 diabetes, are less likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, possibly due to being diagnosed with one or the other. 

Schizophrenia and type 1 diabetes are often both inherited, but the inheritance could be to a social factor such as families being more likely to have animals pets, which would be a likely the source of a virus that causes the disorder. There was a study that found a correlation between cat feces and schizophrenia, but could not be confirmed as the only cause. Cats are unable to properly taste the sweetness of carbohydrates, which could be due to the lack of bacteria that break down the carbohydrates into glucose from having the virus as well. Cats can also be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. 

Bacteria can affect the expression of DNA, and could possibly activate genes already in human and cat DNA that produce the virus, meaning the source of the virus could be harder to detect if it is actually from a bacteria in other animals. The virus found in cat feces could be produced in the same way as the virus in humans, through bacteria from other species.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

so that’s what I just wrote for myself to piece together stuff I’ve read over the years and that doesn’t even include other relations such as from personal experience, having the same major symptoms of type 1 diabetes when my meds were lowered, which are frequent urination, and major thirst and hunger. Also I left out the relation to cannabis but since I thought of it..

a Harvard study found that being genetically susceptible to schizophrenia meant being more likely to consume cannabis suggesting it may be a form of self medication.

 Cannabis affects insulin sensitivity as well, and I’ve seen conflicting studies on whether it increases or decreases, so it could be that CBD and THC, the two major chemicals in cannabis could have opposite effects on insulin. Which means some kinds of weed would help and some kind would make it worse, so like the body might crave it because it helps sometimes but unaware that depending on the kind of weed that it can also make it worse. When it’s illegal, the amount of each chemical you end up with can vary quite a bit, unlike when like its legal where I am now(Canada), and the suppliers have the measure the amount of each in the product.

also I’m not suggesting this is the case for everyone, or that any other beliefs in spiritual causes are unrelated, or that going gluten and sugar free can substitute for meds. The way I see it for myself at the moment, I get an injection every 3 months instead of everyday for diabetics, and my brain is not optimized yet but I can think clearly enough being used to the meds to a certain degree(although they aren’t ideal).

And I know a study in Israel seemed to put a nail in the coffin that cannabis causes schizophrenia.... but once again it could just be that THC makes it worse where CBD could possibly have a different effect, and it was in mice already with a gene disruption that could still be caused by a virus. However I am not suggesting consuming either, either.

My city has a few people known to the entire city to be eccentric. This one guy I've seen will cycle through my neighborhood in a sort of repetitive manner with snorkling goggles on screaming ""truths"". He doesn't appear to be threatening. He'll just ramble on and on about things in the sky he's seen not really having been airplanes, thinking people around him are actually listening. I ended up talking to him once, he doesn't scream when it's an actual conversation. His stories are clearly very disorganized. He's not entirely unkempt, I've seen him buy himself bread and I assume he has a place where he lives permanently. I think he might not be on any medication. Since he doesn't look unkempt, I'm guessing he probably does have people loking after him, BUT I obviously can't know for sure. I think I'll talk to him again some time to find out about these things, though he might become paranoid and wonder why I would want to know such things about him.

I love him and he was always my hero growing but the person I see before me is NOT my brother. I look in his eyes and hes gone.

For example whenever I try to look up coping skills for delusions, its always how to deal with other people's delusions, not your own. I'm hitting a bit of a wall in terms of academic research, so I would like to hear from the people.

The book is sci fi/fantasy and the character's name is Eiset Vaunderweiss. She does not have powers but she does help other people. She's experienced an extended amount of trauma, her schizophrenia manifesting around 16 or 17, after her hair started falling out. She's disabled, having fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, an immune disorder that attacks the shell of her nerve cells,  and alopecia. She has paranoid schizophrenia, and she has more delusions then halucinations. When she does have halucinations they are most likely auditory. She gets stability in her life. By the time the story begins she has a house, a job that can't really fire her, a person that she loves, access to medication and therapy. She's not the only mentally ill character in the cast.
She is smart in the way that she can problem solve and has read alot of books in her free time, reserved, and tends to overwork herself a little bit. She's incredibly kind and careing, though she is tired kinda constantly so she can be rude at times. Her exhaustion leads her to make hasty mistakes at times, its a selflessness vs selfishness thing. She wants to help other people but that takes so much energy.

Medication and therapy decreases the amount of delusions and halucinations if my research is correct. But by what frequency should I show them? Would anything cause a spike in symptoms even if medicated. (Ex. Stress causing depression symptoms to worsen) What is the difference between unmedicated symptoms and medicated symptoms? What would her coping skills look like? I'm probably forgetting a question or two, so please just give me any tips and tricks you feel is relevant. Ask me questions too if you want more info.",0,1

1346,13jbb0c,"I F(31)married a schizophrenic M(33), not knowing about his illness.Now I cannot decide whether to stay in or leave this marriage","In March this year I F(31) married M(33) out of arranged marriage where we were in long term courtship of last 8 months since July last year ,got engaged in October ‘22.

He looked like a peaceful, calm, a little different , introverted guy with a good family. He works in IT,
We both kinda also fell in love during the courtship. He was good looking guy but had gained lot of weight(because of medication) which he stopped(I assume) around the wedding. Since October I remember he would go off during the chats and calls and blame me for not being good at conversation, I used to think that may be this is all because of long distance.Also he hated and talked shit about his family endlessly.I thought may be his family actually dominates and bullies him. 

Fast forward when we started to live after the wedding he started continuously fighting with me, considering that I am his enemy and forcing me to see a psychiatrist. His family would keep quite and tell me that he needs some medication and he will be fine which was very strange for me and my family. I also tried contacting his doctor ,but  the doctor was in touch with his lying family already and did not disclose anything much about his illness.

In April ,my dad gave an ultimatum that he needs to be hospitalised as he is non complaiant with the meds otherwise he would send divorce notice straight to their city.They tried their best to keep lying to us endlessly but had to admit him in late April as he threw both of his parents out who went there to help him. I left that place because I couldn’t take anymore of the emotional abuse .

Now he has been hospitalised and the same doc who refused to share any of his details earlier calls me one day and tells me that he actually has scz and he hates me very much because the delusions that his mind created are very much real for him however he is being councelled and medicated well so that he is aware of his illness and his delusions are controlled.It was very fishy like he as being bribed or something to especially call me .

On the ofher hand his mother calls me almost daily to emotionally manipulate me into being his care taker again once he is in a okay situation and he stops to hate me.
However, my family doesnt trust them and hates them , they dont think that I am safe there and they are so shitty people they can cross any limits and make me mentally unstable.

When it comes  to me I am avery emotional person, I am still not over that  am a newly wed and this all is happening to me.Still wants to see how he feels about all this and give it a chance but his family scares the shit out of me..
Has anyone been in a similar situation where a paranoid schizophrenic can do well in a relationship and stop hating their loved ones?

Tdlr- I got married to a mentally I’ll schizophrenic who is fine on medication but leaves medication whenever he wants to,his family keeps on lying just to make me stay in the marriage.My fam thinks that it is safest and best for me to seperate . However,I want to see how things goes when he is medicated and back from psychiatric ward.",4,1

With schizophrenia, I cannot figure out why I would do that, I genuinely do not know, I feel fucking awful knowing that my mother had spend hundreds of dollars to take me to a therapist when nothing was wrong with me. I have gotten medications for schizoaffective disorder but I have stopped taking them. Also, although faking, I managed to convince my own brain that I have schizophrenia, what I mean by this is that I made myself have full psychotic episodes which included delusions and hallucinations, there has also been incident where I actually heard voices (like the first time) but I do not have schizophrenia, as well as i have filled out a few pages with random words just because I convinced my brain to.

I believe people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective are the only real people, everyone else is under a sort of spell.

1351,4yhj39,"I was diagnosed as schizophrenic and committed myself to healing my psyche. I did it, and a crucial component of that meant ignoring the psychiatrist.","I'm new to this sub so I don't know how you guys feel about the idea of schizophrenia not being an incurable chemical brain disease.

I definitely was schizophrenic. I thought I was Saint Peter for many years, and that my life was the playing out of the book of revelations. I was diagnosed and there was no doubt I was having a mental breakdown of some nature. They called it schizophrenia.
I never allowed myself to perceive it that way.

I knew that in all cultures throughout time, anywhere you look in the world that doesn't have their mental health views shaped by Western culture, it is the shaman who experiences schizophrenia. But he is not a schizophrenic, he is not sick or disabled, in fact he is the spiritual head of the community typically, and his opinion is not only respected but absolutely essential to any decision of any major significance in his village.

So how do we get from mental hospitals to that? The difference is that our culture does not afford a perception of the spiritual within us. We live in a materialistic culture, through and through. It is so to the extreme. 

What these older and non-western cultures see in a mental break down is the spirit incepting the psyche with hints, riddles, and puzzles that are meant to draw you towards a realisation of something you need to realise that will heal you on a psychic level. I know this is going to be conroversial. I'll probably get downvoted, but guys, I've been through it, I've done it, and it's all very, very real, and it all has a place and purpose if you are willing to give your ""symptoms"" (mainly delusions and hallucinations) value and respect.

If you can go into that fantastical place, that often scary, otherworldly and unpredictable place, and if you can find the thread that is connecting your hallucinations or whatever it is that disturbs your material reality, then you can tie that thread of meaning and interpretation to your psyche, your history, and who you are as a person, then you come out, then it all makes sense, it all becomes comfortable, and life becomes more beautiful and richer with meaning and potential.

It's very much like Jung describing dream work and trauma. In fact it's identically the same process. Incarnating as a spiritual being in a limited physical body is without a doubt traumatising. This alone, for the sensitive among us, is enough to cause a trauma that cannot be ignored, and so is brought to us in the form of a mental breakdown.

Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm just hardwired to be good at interpreting and harmonising with my spirit, but in all honesty my schizophrenic break was a glorious and beautiful time in my life. It was other people that turned it into an absolute nightmare, and so I sought solitude and delved into my ""fantasies"".

I believe that until you guys work through this, and especially if you continue to assert that you have a psychic problem, you will steadily lose interest in the physical world. I really don't want to come on here and upset people, but this is my experience, and my life is so profoundly improved for having gone through this that I want to help others on their own quest. It would genuinely make me happy, it's the most interesting part of life that anyone can experience, connecting again with their spirit.

Please don't downvote me into oblivion, I really know what I'm talking about, it just requires that you lend credence and validity to the idea that we are truly spiritual beings.

*EDIT*
There are a lot of practical things you can do to aid this process of discovery/transformation. It's not a pie-in-the-sky ""just be spiritual"" thing. Generally what you want to do is take care of the physical first, your body first, your environment of course. I can elaborate a lot on this whole process of preparation if anyone is interested. But the inner work of finding meaning is totally personal, and truthfully that's the real fun part. But you don't want to enter any kind of contest or dark night of the soul with any more injuries or disadvantages than you have to.",8,1

This is a very long post, but please stay with me.

My cousin lives with my dad, and he has always been light-headed and a bit unresponsive, you’d have to call him twice or thrice if he was on his phone or something for him to reply. I’ve known him for forever, and it always seemed like a normal trait of his and nothing more.

He was always social, funny and full of creativity; we’d play LEGOS (not the video games) and create stories with character without an issue, it was all fun. We were like 7 or 10 years old.

From 17 to 21, my cousin was still very much social and liked by everybody, talkative and fun. He’d go out to parties, drink and do stuff any teenager would.

Until weed came into his life. Mine too, but I’ve been over it for a while.

I didn’t know any details since we live apart and far away, but my cousin started being weird; he was always (trust me, much more than me) stylish, and liked looking good and trendy. But now he’d post stories with his full face on it but not in a selfie way, more like staring at the screen, showing a badly cared for mustache (a few hair, not a real mustache) and his hair outgrown and ugly. Like really uncared for. I didn’t think much of it for a while, until I visited my dad after two years of him visiting instead of me going, and realized he’d just stare aimlessly at nowhere when eating at the table. You’d talk to him and no matter what you said or did, he’d only lightly chuckle and let air out of his nose. Not to say he couldn’t talk because he could if you really tried to talk to him, but it was clear he was distant. He was also looking very high on drugs.  He had no friends that we knew of but one single weird friend as weird as him and he never really goes out to parties or anywhere really. This was six months ago. 

 A week ago I visited again, and this time my dad opened up to me, saying my cousin has had a psychosis attack and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Not only that but he apparently refuses to get vaccinated to help him with the issue and instead sometimes he takes his medications (he takes risperidone, but he refuses the injection and takes it by tabs, but I’m sure he doesn’t do that and often skips the med)he is ,according to himself, not in the wrong and he says he doesn’t need the meds, but his demeanor is extremely weird and unsettling so it is clear he does. The doctor GRAVELY pointed out that continued use of weed could bring terrible outcomes (including his own death) and this is where everything gets scary because even after everything, he still smokes weed; further more he also smokes cigarettes. He is so full of himself that he thinks we don’t notice when he gets home high as nuts; but it’s so extremely weird. He doesn’t have high red eyes the way other potheads do, his eyes literally look irritated and the veins appear; with his face looking crazy pink. He doesn’t reply when you talk to him in that state, and doesn’t do anything but chuckle to himself or listen to music.

Today he took his meds but still went to his friend’s house (meaning he is going to smoke weed again) so he does that while on the meds, not alone. 

Yesterday we had ONE SINGLE conversation (this is the only conversation we have had for the entire week I’ve spent here) in which he asked me what I thought about the fantasy of everything being free and not needing to have money to get whatever you wanted; I replied with a usual answer, that everything would get out of control and society would collapse, but he only replied with: but you’re still going to die you know? And whatever argument I threw his way he replied with that same answer which felt very eerie to me.

I have watched many documentaries, seen too many YouTube stories, and read too many posts about the horrible things an unfortunate person with schizophrenia is able to do to others, and even though I love my cousin, I am beyond scared for my dad and his wife. I need advice to tackle this anxiety, and that’s why I post this. 

How much should I worry and how much hand do I have in this? I sleep with my door closed, but here there’s an Xbox and I play a bit of Fortnite with him, we also make music and his music isn’t bad, he showed me his projects and it gives me a light of hope his brain is still good because it is complex music and it’s fun. It’s not something you could do if you weren’t able minded.

But then he arrives at home red and unresponsive, looking at nowhere in particular and goes straight to his room to either sleep or rather stare at the darkness. And I’m worried.

I need advice because I don’t know anyone with this issue, not even close friends or relatives or anybody, and I don’t wanna talk to him about it because what if I’m in the wrong, and there’s other types of schizophrenia or not every schizophrenic person is capable of murder.

His songs talk about his issues and it leaves it clear to me that there are many issues in his head and his life is hard; his dad kicked him out of his house for smoking pod in it and now he lives with my dad. My dad is pondering to send him somewhere for rehab, but I’m afraid it could be too late, since he is smoking and getting high as I type this right now.

Thanks for reading and I hope you understand my situation; I love him but I am scared for my dad.",3,1
1360,n7pblk,What if schizophrenia is actually mind control...,"In some cases these people are defined as schizophrenics but they are not schizophrenics something is happening in the world!

Think of it this way you are mind controlled and you hear voices but when you go to the doctor he would tell you it is schizophrenia and everyone you tell your story would think it is schizophrenia because it is what doctors say but you know for sure it is not because the voices respond when you talk to them and in some cases control your body and physically torture you. This is what happens around the world and because doctors do not have a scientific explanation the opinion that has been formed is schizophrenia. And even if the doctor were to believe you do you imagine him telling the authorities that you are mind-controlled? This is not a simple act and even if a few doctors report it the effect will be slow and by then people around the world who are mind controlled will be defined as schizophrenics when they are not.

 Think of someone transmitting some frequency to your brain and it makes you hear voices, you go to the doctor and he sends you for an EEG but as soon as you perform the test they stop (disconnect) the frequency and your brain looks normal in the test and so there does not seem to be any anomaly in the electrical activity in your brain. **How do you prove it does not happen scientifically?** 

They force people to tell the psychiatrist what they want you to say. In a lot of cases it can be identified when a completely normal person has suddenly changed in a really unusual way, initial symptoms are confusion and severe paranoia. Sometimes it is expressed in a sense of persecution, usually by the government but also by family, friends and neighbors or Cars that follow them. In more advanced cases a person thinks he is possessed, a spirit that guides him or that God speaks to him. Sometimes they make the person to thinks of himself as the savior of mankind and defines himself as the Messiah or Jesus Christ, according to his religion. Or they make the impression that you are extraordinarily important. In extreme cases it can manifest in extreme violence by the person, murder or suicide. **Lots of mass Shooting/murder cases are a result of this control**.

**Now think about the helplessness of those people and their loneliness.**

Another way Identify it is to see online the symptoms I mentioned. They spread in all the groups I mentioned and probably in other places.

Jerry Marzinsky retired as a psychiatric evaluator in 2015 after working psych crisis in hospital emergency rooms for the last ten years of his career.  It was only after retiring that he felt free to speak about these findings and challenge the dismal failure of our expensive, pharmaceutically fueled merry go round of a mental health system.

Although Jerry Marzinsky raises the **Possession entity** issue after his retirement he is the only one I know who talks about the issue openly. If you have any information about psychiatrists or medical professionals talking about this openly please share.

The machine’s operators were a gang of undercover Jacobin terrorists, who Matthews described with haunting precision. **Their leader, Bill the King**, was a coarse-faced and ruthless puppetmaster who ""has never been known to smile""; **his second-in-command, Jack the Schoolmaster**, took careful notes on the Air Loom’s operations, pushing his wig back with his forefinger as he wrote. **The operator was a sinister, pockmarked lady known only as the ""Glove Woman**"". The public face of the gang was a sharp-featured woman named Augusta, superficially charming but ""exceedingly spiteful and malignant"" when crossed, who roamed London’s west end as an undercover agent.

**To all those who claim that these are mentally ill people and what they claim happens only to them and it proves nothing. Here's a question for you!**

How do you prove something subjective like mind control? By the general experience... You can equally argue that people lie when they feel fear and joy but we as a society have come to an agreement of what is joy and what is fear by sharing our experiences alone.

Ask yourself how do we prove something that is an emotional experience if not by sharing experiences. But the problem begins when people who claim to have voices in their head or are controlled by someone seem to label them straight as mentally ill Instead of listening to them and asking but what if that's true?

Here's what this technology allows,

Many people make a living based off of their psychic talents and even have their own TV shows, so I guess I'm just wondering at what point did they discover these were actual abilities?

1362,107kqa6,Don't bother joining Freemasonry if you are on the Schizo-Spectrum,"So, I am in the midst of an ongoing argument on the Freemason subreddit.  I want you to read this to understand why you should be angry.  Odds are, they will probably see this; but, the hell with them at this point. 

All I ask them is, how rare is it to be blackballed from Freemasonry's voting process twice?  Voting is secret.  At the time (early-2022), nothing was disclosed with regards to my mental health.  However, members of that subreddit this morning look up my admissions of my mental health in this website on an obscure post and say that I am a ""trainwreck,""  that I am ""confused,"" that I deserved to be blackballed and that I am mentally unfit for some mental breakdown I had 1,930 days ago, that I am ""unstable"" because I am openly trans.  

From what I conclude based on their posts, if you are Schizophrenic - even if you have had your symptoms in remission for years through therapy and medications - you will be discriminated and rejected.  If you are/were Transgender, you will be ostracized in most cases.  It is irrelevant how far you go in life.  You could own your own apartment.  You could go to honors colleges.  But, if you have a mental breakdown or if the hormones in your system are different, you will be considered in the same ballpark as pedophiles and chronic liars.  Masons claim to be for those who seek enlightenment; yet these charlatans will reject based on deviations from perceived perfections.  

Moral of the story is, if you are mentally ill, do not indicate to anyone about it.  You will be scrutinized, demeaned, and ostracized.  To them, it is irrelevant whether you get accepted to Honors Colleges, rent $1,500 per month apartments through hard work.  The ""Old Boys Club"" will reject you if you are a human being with a mental ailment.

1392,92yh8x,How I beat Skitzophrenia,"Hey folks, 

I thought I'd share my tactic to beating Skitzophrenia with you lads and see how people find it!

Some things to note first..

1. I never took medication for it because I believed in mindfulness practice to an extreme..

2. I'M NOT TELLING PEOPLE TO STOP TAKING MEDS OF ANY KIND! If this works for you and you feel better, speak to your doctor first..

3.Everyone is different and I don't think this will work for most people but I still wish to share it..

So I'm not going to go into details about unimportant things and keep this as short as possible.. 

it started after smoking weed, the first time being with ""the Devil"" hallucinations, god/Jesus And seeing things in the clouds which I'm sure many of you have had similar experiences of..

I ofc went completely mad and was sent to a hospital to be diagnosed and given medication (which I refused to take once I got out and that was 5 years ago)

I've then did a lot of research about the topic and lost faith in christianity all together which begun my interest in Buddhism and mindfulness..

After reading so much I've learned how to control any hallucinations and even change them for more pleasant hallucinations..

I see hallucinations as nothing more than dreams/nightmares and find that these things helped me the most to change the darker hallucinations..

3 rules I've learned from mindfulness teachings are..

1. Awareness of desire (wanting to be free from Skitzophrenia for example)

2.Awareness of illusions (or ignorance, such as believing in things like demons/devils thus defining them and not letting them simply be as they are)

3.Awareness of fear (knowing it is just an illusion)

So this is how I've learned to combine these 3 things to change ""horrific"" insulting voices such as lucifier/the devil calling me a bitch, rat, scumbag and dog to more peaceful states such as angles singing, Buddha appearing and feelings of pure bliss/ecstasy!

Allow the voices to do what they do (insulting you for example) and listen to them without judging them. As you do this, learn to not attach to them and realise that they are just illusions, nothing more. Don't talk to them or try to ignore them, simply let them be while being aware of them.. 

This brings me to desire! You feel so angry and depressed when you are desiring a different outcome in your mind! Rather than complain that they are like this, use my method and simply accept them as illusions, your mind.. you are only consciousness, not attached to these things in the slightest.. they don't do anything but make you aware..

And lastly there is fear.. ever lucid dream and the second you think of something bad it changes? It's the same for Skitzophrenia but by realising the true nature (you fear the Devil through ignorance/illusion rather than accepting it for what it is.. forget the names and beliefs even if they tell you other wise)..

Now an important trick here is that when you fail one of these steps (which you will) , you simply take yourself back to the steps and try again..

 Never beat yourself up for failing, it takes practice  but it's worth it and may help you!

Eventually the voices (illusions) will change as you stop attaching to them, realising that fear is false and that there is nothing to desire, all is well.. It becomes awesome then :P

A helpful link that helped me realise all this is here, that guy who posted it is awesome!

1396,5yakf3,I think I have Schizophrenia but I don't want to see a doctor,"It's really hard for me type out long posts in go into detail about why I think have schizophrenia. There are a lot of things about me that seem to fit the diagnosis. I've had this ""brain fog"" for the last 10 years of my life that's pretty much the cognitive decline aspect of schizophrenia. I'm pretty sure everyone knows what I mean when I say brain fog, it's very difficult to focus on anything, can't remember what I read, have trouble thinking analytically. I can barely have conversations with people. It's like my mind just goes blank. 

Whenever someone asks me a question I have a lot of trouble coming up with an answer and it's usually just one or two words. It's hard for me to speak coherently. Like telling a story off the top of my head would be literally impossible to do. Words don't come easy to me. 

I've  been depressed for the last 10 years. I have suicidal thoughts. I have addiction problems. I'm   socially isolated. I don't trust people at all.You could say I'm paranoid. I don't care about my appearance. . This is where it gets tricky because I know that ""delusions"", especially delusions of grandeur are symptoms of schizophrenia, but I actually do believe I'm capable of changing the world positively in very a major way. And I don't think I'm being delusional because I've also  had low self esteem and low confidence my entire life. So that really doesn't mesh with my alleged delusions of grandeur because why would someone who's had low self esteem and low confidence his whole life have delusions of grandeur and see himself as being greater than he really is ? I think my so called delusions are reality. And I don't care if other people tell me that schizophrenics are also 100% convinced their delusions of grandeour are also real.I believe mine are grounded in fact and I have good reason to believe so.  

Also I'm not sure whether or not my mother has schizophrenia but she had did have a really crazy episode a while back where she believed that God was directly talking to her and that she was his new messenger and he also sent her an angel from heaven to advise her. This was like 15 years ago and she's kind of normal now, even though she has her quirks.

I don't hear any voices and I never have. I see things that aren't there like bugs and mice sometimes. 

I don't want to see a psychiatrist because it makes me very uncomfortable. I can't open up or be honest with them. They're going to keep asking me questions about my life and my past and I don't want to answer them. If they give me medication I won't take it.

So do I have schizophrenia or not ? The only reason I want to know is because I'm worried it could get worse. Now my life is pretty shitty and miserable right now but if this is as bad as it's going to get for me then I could accept that. I can still function high enough where I'll never have to worry about being homeless. But if it's going to get worse than this then I just don't know if I could handle it. ",0,1

1420,4uzfp4,I tried to kill myself last Monday night.[Graphic],"I tried to kill myself last Monday night at around 22:30(10:30 pm). I had just had an argument with a friend over the phone, he's gotten involved in a pyramid scheme, some ""Get Rich Quick"" scheme that involves signing people up, selling them some software that's supposed to make them money and in return for all this, for signing people into the Scheme, he's being promised some ridiculous interests of any and all money he'll put into the software/site. He thinks it's all legit and on the up and up because there are these two American fakers that have spoiled him and promised him all sorts of fame and fortune.

I couldn't, and this made all sense in the moment, watch him and his family put all their money into this thing and get ruined. So I decided to self harm a little which turned into me stabbing myself in the calf,[ leaving the blade in for a moment while I took a picture for some reason](http://i.imgur.com/n49MT9Q.jpg), I do not know why, probably to save because I was amazed at how far in the damn thing went, I then removed the blade and watched the blood just spew out of the wound. 

I always, when I try something like this, have this little nagging feeling inside of me that no matter what I do to myself, I'm going to live. That's probably why I took the picture of the blade sticking out of my calf. 

I waited for a moment, I was going to just let myself bleed out but I then remembered that I hadn't written a letter or said goodbye to anyone so I stood up, opened the door to the hall and walked into the kitchen. I tried to tell my mother I was leaving for good but I couldn't so I just said ""Mom, I think I've cut something wrong""
She just knew there was something wrong, stood up from her chair in the living room and ran to me, freaking the fuck out. 

She managed to stop the massive bleeding, no doubt from the [Popliteal artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popliteal_artery). Then, after she'd cried for a while, while cleaning up the blood, my blood, because she didn't want my sister to see it because it could damage her for life, she told me to go into the shower to clean myself off. I walked from the kitchen and into the foyer where the shower is and it started bleeding again. I said ""Mom, It's starting to bleed again........well, it's only a little...."" and as I said that it just started gushing out of the wound. Like when there comes a [tear on a garden hose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F7_GRif7CE&feature=youtu.be&t=15s).. Mom freaked more out, and she managed to stop the bleeding for the second time while also putting some patches and plasters on it, wrapping it in gauze and taping that all together...

Then my father and sister came home from riding horses and my mother told me to hide my leg, even though I have plenty of other scars my sister is bound to have seen before, the wound from this suicide attempt being one and a half centimeter long. The real damage was how deep it was...

When I entered the scene of the crime, my room, again after everything [I took this picture](http://i.imgur.com/h0Gi7zB.jpg). Probably to show as proof if someone dares to question me and my struggles. 

Again, it all made sense in the moment. 

Then I cleaned up of course.

My mother still doesn't know I was trying to kill myself. She thinks it was just self harming that went so wrong. There are three people in the world that know that, four counting you. One good friend of mine, my cousin and my older brother.

The reasons for doing these things are still pretty hazy in my mind. But I think what caused this whole thing was the idea of losing a friend, a good friend, who's helped me a lot through out the years, and not wanting to see the day where we're not friends anymore... Because the phone calls we shared were awful. Him crying when I heard from him Monday morning, probably fake crying to guilt me, he's good at those sorts of things, me crying, for reals, Monday night and self harming pretty good because of it.

Oddly enough did the psychotic symptoms not have a hand in this as I've been free of those for almost nine or ten months now...
I know, I know, that was no reason to kill one self... It was a destructive relationship, him trying to fool me into this pyramid scheme of his. But I realized when I had payed for it all that there was something off, it was too good to be true... I did the math and it payed off. But I kinda wish I was still with him in this scheme of his, so I wouldn't be a friend poorer and a suicide attempt richer.

Why stab one self in the calf you might ask? Well, it's something the voices tought me during my first major psychotic break. That if I lived through all this shit, there wouldn't be easily recognizable scars on my arms to indicate that I'm so, very, deeply disturbed. That there wouldn't be anything for people to see and then ask me about because people are nosy as fuck with their noses and nosy nosiness into everything that's somehow odd or different than them. 

Ever since my first major psychotic break, I've done most of my self harming on my left lower leg. Now it looks like I have stone cold monster of a pet polar bear cub that keeps tearing and biting my lower left leg. 

I guess I'm thankful for my mother having saved me from sudden death, yet again, but there's a part of me that wishes that I would have just died on the floor there... Too bad I just had to go into the kitchen. If I'd stayed in my room I would have died in peace. Next time I've gotta make arrangements beforehand. Letter, goodbyes and all that crap.

Those were perhaps 600-800 ml(20-27 oz) that gushed out of me and I'm easily a three liter man, probably the reason I didn't die from blood loss.

6) I look at things and they seem so strange- almost as if I rub on them and they'll start moving or something. 

I have told so many psychiatrists these symptoms, and they feel that I dont have schizophrenia, even though I feel like I am falling apart. Is there ANY other disorder that could be the cause of this? They have pinned this to anxiety and depression. ",0,1

1424,4ni949,Am I schizophrenic?,"I understand that I should speak with my doctor but I just want to hear your opinions. 

Here's some things that I do.

-Talk to myself, have conversations with self (I do this a lot, funnily enough it keeps me sane.)
-Stare blankly, not blinking (It just feels good.)
-Lazy movements (walking, reaching , etc. Almost a drunken stupor.)
-Catch my self saying things when having intrusive thoughts. (most common: ""nothing matters"", ""i hate myself"", ""just kill me"".
-Auditory hallucinations ONLY when in the shower. (sounds of doors opening, very quiet whispering in background.)
-Blank expression
-Pace around my house often when in thought.
-Things don't entertain me, I feel like I have to put in effort to do things that I used to enjoy.
Really insecure. (When something bad or embarrassing happens I DWELL on it all day.)
Severe anxiety, I have panic attacks when leaving my house. (I can get by for a short time if I drink a alcohol.)
Prefer to be alone (I just kind of accepted that I will never get a long with people and would like to live my days alone.)
When in public I feel like I stick out (I do.) and constantly feel like I am being criticized. 

Things that I do not have
-visual hallucinations (there was only one time where I was really distressed and on medication that I saw a 2D black dot the size of a tennis ball on the floor that disappeared into the wall.)
-voices in head (I do have a lot of intrusive and compulsive thoughts but they do not seem foreign at all.
-Delusions, as far as I can tell.

I'm not good at finishing things. I look forward to your responses, thanks.

My boyfriend's brother is baffling to all of us because we aren't quite sure what is up with him. He is 22 years old, lives at home since graduating from college, paces all day/ sits in his room with blinds pulled and no lights on doing nothing, or stands around the house seemingly thinking or just staring at the wall. The only social interaction he does is briefly visits facebook but doesn't contribute or communicate. Only grooms himself when told to, keeps very weird schedules and has clear OCD rituals which interferes with the family. Does not communicate at all, not even a yes/no or a head nod. Is very much opposed to expressing emotion and talking and only becomes expressive (verbally violent) when confronted and challenged about his behaviors/getting a job and moving on with life. Shows absolutely no interest in anything. Mute. It has to be more than just OCD and his parents have thus far spoken to a couple of professionals. They cannot get him to therapy because he is violently opposed to going. His parents are trying to see what they can do about outpatient treatment because he is essentially slowly deteriorating. Let me know your thoughts on what he could potentially have and if it is in the realm of schizophrenia. Thank you all for your time.",1,1

I'm trying to find somewhere on Reddit that aligns more with my thoughts and experiences on the matter, but they all seem to be pretty inactive, and I need more than the Mad in America forums to convince myself people are reading my backstory infodumps and rantings.

Is there anywhere posted to regularly that takes an alternative view on the experiences I've been having over the past year? Other off-Reddit places are cool too. I've already mentioned MiA, and I'm considering getting into the Icarus Project but find myself a little hesitant to dive into something so vast in scope.

1430,3656p0,Help determining whether or not I am Schizophrenic,"This came out way longer than expected, sorry in advance, I added a TLDR.

So to start it out with some background info, I'm a 17 year old male. My grandma was schizophrenic, though my mom hasn't shown any signs yet. When I was a kid, I would tell my mother that I had trouble controlling my thoughts. I don't remember exactly what her answer was, but I remember her not really understanding and me walking away 20 seconds later. I was tested for ADHD and it came negative,  but I clearly remember the test and it was total bullshit. Literally just showed you pictures and you said what they were. As long as you didn't stare into space in the middle of it they said no. OK whatever that's probably irrelevant. 
I am a teen,  so for a while I just told myself ""you're fine stop being a retarded edgy teenager"", but I'm kinda done with that. For some more background I browse the site 4chan.org ALOT. It's kind of my home and I started going there about ~3 years ago or 7th grade. I was raised on the internet, played MMORPG'S as a kid instead of Nintendo and xbox. So I have always felt like all my anxiousness fades away when I'm using one, or really just have a Internet connection in general. 
Anyways again, the voices I recently have been hearing have 1 set personality. He is a fucking 4chan user in my head. Maybe not exactly that but the language he uses is full of the words faggot, so he sounds like one I guess, maybe that's a bad analogy. It is annoying as hell,  and only until it started making me lose focus at school and stuff did I really force myself to admit it exists. It is just him commenting ALL DAY. I'll suddenly start arguing in my head over the dumbest shit sometimes. Than comes the paranoia. I can't help this one. I'm always checking windows and I CAN NEVER SHAKE THE FEELING I'M BEING WATCHED. Not like there's a guy creeping at my  window, but it is that feeling, like when you are walking in a hallway and there's someone walking behind you, how you get self concious about everything you do and you walk a little funny etc. I feel like that all the time now, though it has nothing to do with me checking windows. I don't know why I check windows, but if I hear a car start up I MUST know who it is and I'll dash and look ""oh the neighbor is leaving his driveway in his red truck"" and go back to why I was doing. Same for hearing people outside.  
And the last thing I do is he seeing things. It's always just something in the corner of my eye that I quickly turn my head to see and it's gone. Usually it's a shadow around a corner. This is starting to happen more frequently. 
I have trouble showing emotions. I can't show anger at all, I will never be able to raise my voice at someone. I don't know what to do/say when im happy or sad. I just kind of clam up. I can't look people in the eye, I just cannot do it. I have been depressed for a long time but never told anyone. I started saying I was an insomniac to make an excuse for the sleep deprivation all this causes me.

TLDR OF SYMPTOMS: I have a guy saying negative comments in my head all day, I always feel like I'm being watched and I check windows and my surroundings constantly cause I'm paranoid of nothing I guess. I have lots of anxiety and depression but can't seem to show/tell them to anyone, my grandmother had schizophrenia, I don't get a lot of sleep. I hope I'm not just being an edgy teenager.",0,1

Found some pretty interesting stuff but I couldn't find much information that wasn't kind of vague and general.


[Link about childhood type](http://psychcentral.com/disorders/conduct-disorder-symptoms/)


> *Nonetheless, psychopathy has been proposed as a specifier under an alternative model for ASPD. In the DSM-5, under ""Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders"", ASPD with psychopathic features is described as characterized by ""a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors (e.g., fraudulence)."" Low levels of withdrawal and high levels of attention-seeking combined with low anxiety are associated with ""social potency"" and ""stress immunity"" in psychopathy.[19]:765 Under the specifier, affective and interpersonal characteristics are comparatively emphasized over behavioral components.[20]*





> *While it has been shown that lower levels of serotonin may be associated with ASPD, there has also been evidence that decreased serotonin function is highly correlated with impulsiveness and aggression across a number of different experimental paradigms. Impulsivity is not only linked with irregularities in 5HT metabolism but may be the most essential psychopathological aspect linked with such dysfunction.[30] Correspondingly, the DSM classifies ""impulsivity or failure to plan ahead"" and ""irritability and aggressiveness"" as two of seven sub-criteria in category A of the diagnostic criteria of ASPD.[7]*


> *Some studies suggest that the social and home environment has contributed to the development of antisocial behavior.[38] The parents of these children have been shown to display antisocial behavior, which could be adopted by their children.*



interesting!


> *Children with early damage in the prefrontal cortex may never fully develop social or moral reasoning and become ""psychopathic individuals ... characterized by high levels of aggression and antisocial behavior performed without guilt or empathy for their victims.""[39][40] Additionally, damage to the amygdala may impair the ability of the prefrontal cortex to interpret feedback from the limbic system, which could result in uninhibited signals that manifest in violent and aggressive behavior.*



Some of the symptoms listed for all mental issues are pretty vague and overlapping so I am hoping we learn more about all of them. Also recently learned that bi-polar and depressed individuals can have hallucinations as well.

1457,1194z2h,What if I don't know if I'm schizophrenic?,"For a while, I've been thinking I must have some kind of personality or mood disorder, and schizophrenia seems the most likely for several reasons.
1. Paranoia, I constantly think my younger siblings are trying to hurt me and cause me pain
2. Auditory hallucinations, I constantly hear people saying my name and knocking on my door, when no one is there
3. This is difficult to explain, but I have a guardian spirit, he is difficult to see, because he is mostly translucent, but he has very pale skin, and dark hair, I don't know his name, he never speaks, he always calms me down when I hear the voices and knocking
4. I've heard that schizophrenic people believe they are enlightened by the universe, and I've always thought I understood a second meaning behind everything, a way that everything is connected that I don't know how to explain to other people
5. I can't have window curtains open, they have to be closed, or someone will see inside
6. Leaving my room is scary, since my spirit prefers to stay in there, and rarely leaves, I don't like to go away from my room, though I do still feel safe leaving during the day, not at night
7. Sometimes my spirit leaves my room at night, it's terrifying, I don't know when he'll come back, it feels almost like sleep paralysis, though not quite as bad

Those are the reasons I think I might have schizophrenia, but there are a few reasons I think I might not have schizophrenia

1. I'm fifteen, most people don't start to develop schizophrenia until at least twenty
2. I'm autistic, and a lot of these things could be explained by that
3. I think I'm schizophrenic, and from what I understand, most schizophrenic people refuse to believe they are schizophrenic
4. The guardian spirit I mentioned feels real, but I understand that he isn't, and sometimes it seems like I just use him like some people use a stuffed animal, or a dream catcher, to scare away the dark 
to clarify, I'm not scared of the dark, I'm afraid of the voices in the dark, and the knocking (the knocking is scarier than the voices)

Does this sound like schizophrenia, or early onset schizophrenia to you guys? I'm honestly just confused, since I've started looking into schizophrenia, I've noticed how much my behaviors match up, but I can't believe that my brother aren't trying to hurt me, it feels too real.",2,1
1458,115h30b,Will I eventually get Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder?,"# My Psychoses 

I was diagnosed with unspecified non-organic psychosis lasting three months, so I had a psychosis that wasn't drug induced and that just came on as I entered adulthood. I am lost and my parents are lost to, they do not know what is wrong with me, I have depression but it is undiagnosed but my care workers seem to think I qualify for a depressive or some sort of mood disorder. 

My GP has also said I have Autism Spectrum Disorder although I just think depression gets in the way of my social skills. This is all I can gauge about my mental health as a diagnosis takes 12-18 months to go through therefore I have no interest in applying for a mood disorder diagnosis. As I gradually taper off Olanzapine (anti-psychotic) I can feel the disconnect from reality again, as it was in Psychosis, I feel as though I may have another episode in the next year which would really suck as I would be studying for my degree.

# Some key facts:

I have been molested by my next door neighbour as a child for years which stopped when I turned 14 (20 now) and my family seem to think it's a 'trauma' but I really don't feel as though it's very traumatic.

I have no history of Schizophrenia in the family. 

I do have history of Depression in the family.

I do not do any drugs nor do I drink alcohol, nicotine and caffeine is my vice

1463,zxhow3,Parenting with schizophrenia…,"My stepson (I’ll call him Jay 28) got married to a girl from Turkey.  He has been quiet about their courtship and about HER (I’ll call her Anna 28) in general.  No big deal… some people don’t talk about their relationships. 

They got married right away and got pregnant right away. She is due mid-February. 

We learned that she had been to the hospital multiple times, but was never given a reason why. We all assumed it was baby related. Until, Jay’s mom was going to go visit.  He is in the Air Force and stationed on the east coast, we are in Arizona. 

I guess the stress of meeting her new MIL triggered an “episode” and she called 911 on herself and ended up being in the hospital for a month. That was October. 

Putting pieces of conversations together between his parents we know that she is “fighting demons”. She was prescribed soleraquil. Then we heard she wasn’t taking that anymore. We don’t know if she is taking ANYTHING now. 

She went back in the hospital after a couple weeks and is still there because the demons won’t let her eat. And she’s got a feeding tube!  

That boy won’t volunteer any information and avoids direct questions.  He has an amazing support system if he would talk to us. 

His mother has called her mother (in Turkey) to get more detail. 

Her mother said (thru a language barrier) that Anna has had MANY episodes and has a “team” of doctors. Those doctors advised her to not take her regular meds if she wanted to get pregnant.  So she went off cold Turkey when she arrived in the states. 

Jay has known all along and her family LOVES him and thinks he is a savior for loving her. 

To add a whole other level they are Christian. Very Christian… like the kind of people who believe prayer will work better for demon fighting than medication will. The kind that don’t do birth control because that is “playing God”. 

So my question is: what is parenting with schizophrenia like?  Based on what we know, and how unprepared we believe they are… my husband is ready to call a lawyer and try to get custody of the baby.  

I know that wouldn’t happen until something bad happens… but that’s scary. 

I never parented Jay, I want to be the rational (mostly) uninvolved voice.  What should we expect? With them living 2500 miles away… what should we be on the watch for? How can we best help? 

I know that people parent with mental health issues, I am just worried about that baby. If Anna can’t handle a friendly visit from her MIL how will she handle a sick baby, a language barrier, a house, and living 1/2 the way across the world from her support system?",1,1

1465,zo579i,Is this psychosis?,"Firstly, hopefully I don’t offend any of guys because I’ve not been diagnosed with this disorder, only psychosis back into 2020 but this group is more active. 
So lately I haven’t been eating or sleeping much but I feel like I have some intense energy that I could conquer the world. I keep seeing all this posts and videos on Facebook about tapping into your Goddess energy. Back into 2020 I saw sentences appearing in the Bible telling me I was the Spirit and the Bride of Christ. It took me about a year to get out of it with meds. 
Recently the doctor cut my anti psychotic dose because he doesn’t think I need it, ever since then I have been feeling amazing like walking on sunshine. I feel like I need to share my revelations with everyone. I’ve been giving a lot of money to charity even though I don’t have a job right now. 
I should be feeling stressed out due to the job seeking (haven’t worked with kids since psychosis) and my dog in the process of dying but I feel incredible. I haven’t been eating or sleeping well but I don’t need to. I’ve been feeling jolts of electricity come throughout my body that I believe is God speaking to me. I feel like the absolute best version of myself and I don’t want to talk to the doctor because I am afraid he will try to take away my Goddess energy. I saw a spiritual vision of myself as a blue orb that came down to reincarnate as a woman. But I’m perfectly functional, just feeling extreme joy, thank you have a wonderful day all 😊😊",0,1
1466,z8jcdh,a clarification post,"i made a post 2 days ago about how i think i may have schizophrenia but i’m scared to seek help for it. unfortunately i think there was a misunderstanding somewhere that led to some pretty nasty comments, and i’d like to clear things up.

my anxiety over seeking professional help for my mental issues stems from my mom. i started telling her about my hallucinations and severe anxiety from a young age and she wrote it off as being “because of that damn phone” and said i have nothing to worry about. she also claims to have experienced similar things around my age as further reason to hold no concern for my mental state. for this reason i’m extremely worried that if i seek mental help it will be dismissed in the same way with no evaluation and that i’ll keep living in this hell.

to that one commenter, i’m not “looking to be special.” i don’t want to live like this. from the age of 10 i’ve been performing my entire life for invisible eyes that watch me everywhere, all of the time. i’m 18 and live with my family, but i’m the only person who lives upstairs, and i’m convinced there’s someone living in our attic stealing my things and returning them. if this is caused by a mental condition it’s not fucking funny and i’m sick of it. my mental state has been deteriorating for years and it’s affecting my performance in school and at my job. i’m never alone and it’s never quiet. i’m sick of hearing my name called when nobody is there, and locking myself in my room because the demon in the stairwell is trying to kill me. i’m done.

if anybody can offer any support it would be much appreciated. i’m sick of my mental health being pushed aside because i don’t look like anything is wrong with me, or because past experiences still affect me to this day.

EDIT: changed last week to 2 days ago. it felt like last week to me",1,1
1467,ym5gxv,Are these symptoms or am I just being overdramatic,"So recently I had started seeing some things had some interesting things happen. I'm kinda freaking out ngl. So I've been doing research into schizophrenia and I find I fit a lot of the symptoms and I've had them for a while. Here's some, I remember having or have had recently. I have a memory on par with dory so I'm probably missing some things, but yeah here's the list:
(For context on me my name is Meredith, I'm a transwomen, and if anyone has a problem with that they can fuck off, but anyways I'm 20 and I live in michigan with my mom, step-dad and little brother)

I've had a huge sense of paranoia since I was little that something is trying to kill me, idk what, but anytime I'm alone or near a dark or shadowy area I get this huge sense that something is staring at me and trying to grab me or kill me. The severity of the feeling varies day by day, there periods when it's minor and I can ignore it, and then there's times where it's so bad I have to check under everything or I will refuse to go in rooms or put my feet down when I'm sitting. Driving at night terrifies me because I feel like something is in my backseat waiting for the perfect moment to slit my throat or grab my face. In my room I've always needed a night light because it feels like something watching or waiting to kill me. Even nowadays I still need it and even with it, I still feel the need to over myself with my blanket completely just to feel a little ok

Another things that's been happening for quite a while is I see shadowy figures, now I did some research and I saw that since your eyes is made of gel sort of substance it can cause blips in the corners of your eyes. But a lot of times it's something I would see right in front of me. It's usually pretty brief, but I definitely know I saw it. I've also seen white figures or disfigured things occasionally. My best friend and parents confirmed I told them this a lot when I was younger. Recently things got a little more vivid, i started by seeing walls breathing and the floor waving and flowing like water and then a day after I saw what looked like a weird camel spider type bug crawl across the floor and under my wash cart at work, now I'm in Michigan, those don't live anywhere near here. Naturally I freaked out, and backed off, then looked under my cart and nothing was there. Then the other day I was in the stall at work and I started seeing shadows dance across the door and then it changed and looked like there were several hands moving underneath the paint, I freaked out at first, but then reached out and touched it. I didn't feel anything, but I could still see them moving under the paint, not like pushing out just moving. I've also seen lights flash, a few times when I'm driving I'll see a random flash of light across the sky, it's usually pretty bright and clear, but no one else I've been with has ever seen it. And also the other day I was outside with my dad at night talking when suddenly the driveway flashed white. There were no cars or anything outside, so idk what that was. 

Another thing is I've been hearing things for a while idk when it started, but it's usually small things like my name being called out of nowhere or I'll hear a random scream. Sometimes I'd hear phrases. Like I remember hearing randomly one time, ""he's coming"", or like ""watch out"", or ""kill them"". Random things like that. It's been a little while since I've heard stuff like that. Recently it's been more like random laughing or incoherent phrase I can't quite make out or hearing someone call my name. I had asked my friend about it and he said I used to ask him if he heard something, a lot, but he would say no pretty much everytime. Same with my parents.

Something else is I feel or smell and taste things a lot. This is something that's pretty normal for me now. I'll taste random things throughout the day, but I typically just classify it as me craving whatever it is. I also will smell random things, and example is like I was at my job putting on car decals and I would randomly start smelling cinnamon rolls, and there was nothing that could smell like that anywhere and my partner didn't smell anything. I have this happen relatively consistently. Another thing is I will be sitting in my room or something like that and I'll feel something poke me or grab me and nothing will be there. I've also get a feeling where something is crawling on me or biting me or something and when I got to touch the area nothing is there, or it'll feel like things are crawling on multiple parts of me at once, that has been going on for quite a while.

There have been a couple of occasions where I'll look at something at it'll be one color, look away and look back and it'll be another color. This happened a lot at work. I work with cars and a car would be one color I'd look away and then look back and its a completely different color. Or the other day I was spraying water on a car and it turned completely blue, I stopped and started again and it was still blue, after about 30 seconds it was clear again, and no I did not have any sort of dye in the water, just soap, but the soap is white and always has been. And as that was happening my hand looked green, and or had like a green outline. I also will see random lines or flashed of colors over and around objects or people and now it's seems even just randomly I'll see a random line if color or colors in my vision or white line flashing around things. To anyone that watches Arcane its a lot like how they portray the lines and colors around Jinx when she's having a moment or something, they flashed kinda rapidly. I also noticed a while ago I have like static over my vision, almost like TV static over everything I look at, typically it fades into the background pretty easily, but if I focus on it even a little bit it looks like rain or snow and it'll swirl and make little shapes and stuff. I've never heard anyone say they've seen anything like that before so idk maybe a weird unique thing.

I consider it quite normal to have a lot of voices in my head. My head is a constant mess of information, I have a constant chatter of some times hundreds of voices in my head all talking at once, some are louder than others some are just distant chatter, and some are like yelling at me. Depends. I've gotten used to it at this point, but I'm always a having a conversation in my head, 24/7. Sometimes I'll have it outside of my head, I know I myself faces and random expressions about the conversations that people see, usually I don't know I'm doing until someone asks why I'm making certain face. I also have a very vibrant mind like to the point where I sometimes can't distinguish what happened in my head and what actually happened. There have been several occasions where I know an event or conversation happened and then when I mention to the person they have no idea what I'm talking about. Ngl that happens a little too often. Another thing that happens is I can feel, taste and smell what I think of. Even if I've never tasted, smelled or felt it. Like a lot of times it's violent stuff like I'll imagine me cutting my tongue or eyes or something like that and it will feel like a blade is being run across them, and it is so uncomfortable and hurts a lot. Same thing happens when people explain things, my mind fills in whatever blanks they don't and I can feel it with all of my senses as if it was happening to me. Which is not fun, because I have a lot of sensory issues with things already. Dreams are the same way, my dreams are hyper realistic, I can feel, touch, taste, and hear everything with perfect accuracy, it's cool and weird. It also really hurts sometimes too, like get shot or stabbed. Not a fun thing to imagine and feel, idk how accurate those feelings are, but I feel something that's unpleasant, to say the least. Even after I wake up.

I've been told a lot that I'm pretty dense and don't have a lot of emotion. I think I have a lot of emotion I just don't know how to express it. But then a situation happens where my grandma died and I felt nothing at all, no sadness or anything. It just felt like nothing happened and I kinda forgot about it, it was then that I started to really question the amount of emotion I really had. And that happened in February . For context I grew up with her for the first 5 years of my life and constantly saw her throughout the years, so yeah I even thought it was a little strange at first that I didn't really care. I also don't really get excited. My friends and family have told me that they don't think I know how to be excited or happy, most times my emotions just sit at content. I'm not happy or sad or really much of anything I'm just content with whatever. It's how I've always been since about mid to late middle school, before then I was and extremely emotional and sensitive kid, and then out if nowhere it just disappeared and I've been like this ever since. I still feel a lot of emotion it usually takes something or someone else for me to really feel it though. Depends on the situation, because I'm pretty empathetic as well. Like I get fired up and irritated or angry easily and sometimes really sad or depressed, but I don't really ever get excited or anything. Idk tbh, it's really weird. I don't even understand it myself, it makes no sense, but at the same time makes perfect sense. Idk, it's a thing

I had kinda mentioned I had a bad memory at the start, but when I say bad I mean bad. Like to the point where I will completely forget what someone told me seconds after they said it. I piss my parents off a lot because of it. I constantly forget what they said, I forget dates, events, days, why I'm in a room or area, I forget situations, memories. I even forget my thoughts a lot, I lose my train of thought so often and it seriously pisses me off. Or will hop points and topics a lot even if they have nothing in common, my brain has this magical way of relating evertlyrhing to everything. Can be a little confusing my brain can start at learning how to tie a shoe and end at have a conversation about the catacombs or some shit. Idk it's weird, and can never keep track of it. I'm used to it, but it can be confusing to some people. I think of some of the most random shit to, I've had my best friend who smokes ask me if I'm high sometimes, even though he know I don't do any sort of drugs or anything. I find it kind of funny ngl. I've also had a lot of situations, especially recently where I did something and then walk or look away and come back or look back and I didn't do it or I did something completely different. I'm also pretty clumsy as of lately I seem to hurt my self in the stupidest ways on literally everything, like my spatial awareness has depleted so hard

Idk I'm an introvert and have been for a while I don't like people at all and for a while I had social anxiety so bad I couldn't even have a conversation. That was in like 2020. That's when I had a huge period of depressive episodes that lasted about a year. After that I got pretty heavily into spirtuality and tarot and stuff like that. Which I'm pretty sure to a doctor or psychiatrist would fall under the delusion category because I do believe a lot of things that people would consider absolutely insane, but tbh I don't care. They make sense to me and science to some degree points towards enough of it for me to believe it. But I'm not really going to get into that here. I tend to disassociate a lot too, at random moments, like when talking, or even a few times while driving(no I have not gotten into am accident while this happens, I somehow go into like autopilot mode), or doing tasks or even just playing games or  anything really. It happens several times a day, for a ranged amount of times, the longest I've disassociated was probably like an hour or two, but thats because I didn't have anything or anyone to kinda snap me out of it, so I just kinda disappeared into my mind or whatever I was staring at. I'm also always tired like 24/7, no matter what, I can get and hour of sleep or 12 hours and nothing changes I'm still just as tired, and it always takes me hours onto fall asleep, anywhere between an hour to 3 or more, occasionally less. 

Another huge issue I had is feeling like people or things are staring at me. This has been an issue I've had for a while like I used to feel like my Legos or toys were staring at me when I was younger and it would make me really uncomfortable. I have a lot of anime figures in my room and still a lot of Legos, I still feel like this even today, same with my posters I guess I just go used to it, so it doesn't bother me as much, usually, but sometimes it gets really bad. And now I'm starting to feel it more with people where it feels like they're staring at me and I'll look at then and they're usually not, but when I look away again it feels like they are. Or I have an issue where if someone is talking about a person or something I immediately assume it's me unless I hear otherwise. Especially if they look at me while their talking to someone then I immediately think they're talking about regardless of the context, and it annoys me a lot, but at the same time I'm not about to just walk up and ask or anything, because that would probably be weird.

Goddamn, sorry for this essay. And I know this is not all of it, but it's the things that stand out to me the most right now. I am going to go talk to a professional about this, but I figured I'd post this here to see what you guys think and if yoyr experiences were similar or anything. I haven't been diagnosed by anyone with anything, my parents where very against seeking help or diagnosis on anything. So idk. As far as I know there no Schizophrenia in my family on my mom's side my dad is a mystery because my mom refuses to talk about him and I've never met him so idk. But if yoy took the time to read this and or respond, thank you! And if you have any questions or want more of an explanation on something I'm more than willing to answer or explain",0,1

1470,xjp1r2,Abandonment,"Tbh, I have a very close connection with my family even as a kid. I was born in China but moved to Hawaii as a kid. My relatives in China on both sides treated me nicely. However after I got schizophrenia, many people started rejecting me. This was especially noticeable on my dad’s side who are farmers and have old views about stigma towards the mentally ill. I haven’t seen them since 2015. They favor my male cousin but treated me alright since I’m from America. But I feel like they traded me for my male cousin after my diagnosis. They gave him all their savings and wanted my dad to give them more. He married this super model looking wife who seems out of his league/high maintenance and he keeps asking us for money. His sister works at a department store and dated construction worker type guys. I feel like he thinks he’s better than the female cousins. I’m not going to argue since dad’s side clearly abandoned me after I got schizophrenia but I still have feelings for them and always have. Want to get married and see family again. Idk how it is that my dad and us are relatively rich and live in Hawaii while my male cousin is in China working his ass off for $1200 a month and can’t even swallow his pride enough to marry a girl who isn’t just pretty. My mom’s side grandma favors me and gave me a gold necklace from Indonesia where my great grandparents were once very wealthy.",1,1
1471,x6p9bb,How do I tell my parents that I have schizophrenia?,"

I am 17 years old, I am studying at the university, my parents invest a lot of money in my education, in addition to this, I have other problems with my health, and now I have a suspicion of schizophrenia.
I had two severe psychoses that I myself experienced, there was and is ocd, it progressed:previously, there were at first more or less harmless thoughts, then they became worse and more terrible and began to cause stress and finally forced me to believe in delirium, until the psychotic that occurred because of the thoughts will not pass, it has been going on for six months.
I thought that I would be able to heal myself, that everything would pass and it happens, but everything just got worse:I have become more depressed, I am not interested in dating and communicating with people, I speak in monosyllabic sentences and look sullen.
I try not to think about bad thoughts, but they come by themselves, and when I start thinking about them, they pull me in, for example:it seemed to me today on a sensual and subconscious level that evil was coming from my mother and that she was bad, she was at home, and I was in my room at that moment, thinking about it, then when everything calmed down, I left the room to hear my mother talking to someone on just the phone and more I realized more that there is no evil and so on, reality has returned, and I know that it was delirium, but during the delirium period it does not get out of your head and you live it until the episode passes and it gets better, so I live every day, experiencing one episode after another.
Another example:when I was on the bus to the university, I decided to think about whether I could just cause an episode of delirium in my head, I just imagined that it was not September but August, imagined that it was warm and so on, and it worked, it really seemed to me for a while that August was actually September on the street.I immediately became afraid that this way I could believe in anything, replacing reality.
I just really want to stop all this, I don't want to fight every day with this shit that comes to me,I want to live a real life like all healthy people who don't have to wake up in the morning and think that today everything will happen again and there will be a day like yesterday, and wait for the night to relax and fall asleep and not think about it more..",1,1
1472,wpwa2e,suspected im schizophrenic for around 2 1/2 years,"i (16f) have been researching schizophrenia ever since i had an ‘episode’ (self harm/hitting/voices) a couple years ago and my symptoms have only gotten worse. i have hallucinations pretty much every day but usually it’s minor stuff like whispers or animals that aren’t really there, but there have been times where i’ve had hallucinations so real i was truly convinced. the hardest part is the voices though, they say awful things i don’t even feel comfortable sharing on the internet. i’ve been hospitalized before + gone to a few therapists and 2/3 said schizophrenia was possible but i would cut things off shortly after that because i was scared of getting diagnosed. i have moments where i feel like someone else is trapped inside my body or that i’m jesus and no one can hurt me or that the government is coming to arrest me bc they know ‘everything i’ve done’ (??? i don’t even know what makes me so paranoid about this because i havent done anything for the government to care) obviously this is a very summarized version but does anyone know what this is?? i don’t even care if it’s schizophrenia i’ve just been so confused for years and want answers.",1,1
1473,wpeki1,I think my friend is schizophrenic,"This is my first reddit post so sorry in advance if this isn’t the best sub or if there’s unwritten rules/procedures I’m not following correctly. 

Anyway, I have a friend of 8-9 years that I am 99% sure is schizophrenic yet is still in denial. He hasn’t been diagnosed but he has been showing symptoms for almost 2 years and its getting worse and worse by the day. I don’t necessarily want to go into much detail but here are some key things that make me feel this way:

- constantly bringing up insignificant situations that happened years ago claiming there are secret messages behind my/others actions. 

- accusing me and many others of hacking his phone/computer.

- accusing almost every male he knows of having intercourse with his crush from 2 years ago.

- calling, texting and harassing said crush for the last 2 years.

- saying things that make no sense - that almost seem like coded messages.

- his hygiene has come to an all time low (almost non-existent) 

- when recommended therapy by multiple people, he claims we are all plotting against him.

I could go on for hours but I think that paints the picture pretty well. Most, if not all of the things listed are done on repeat and out of the blue as if it’s normal and the first time he has ever mentioned/done it.

Its so sad seeing such a close childhood friend get to this point but I have tried everything in my power to help and nothing has worked. I feel like im the only one in his life that still gives him the time of day but it is weighing on me pretty heavily as well. 
I personally have never dealt with any serious mental illnesses so I don’t know what else to do.

All that being said - I really just want to know if there is a way to involuntarily have him admitted to a therapist or mental health institution. Or if anything at all, does anyone with similar experience have anything they recommend trying? Anything will help.

I really want to help my friend get help before its too late.",0,1
1474,wpa3y4,"uhh, please read","For a while now I've been dealing with hallucinations and a cluster of paranoid thinking patterns and mental-health issue cocktails that, when i read up on them. Really fit schizophrenia.

I've been in screening for it a couple months. Today i went to my psychologist again for a diagnosis.

She roughly said the following: ""we have no clue what's up with you, so for now we'll blame everything on your autism and make a bunch of assumptions based on what we experience in others with autism and see if you have a psychosis later down the line.""

And then she said the following. ""we're giving you a gender dysphoria diagnosis""

And the gender dysphoria diagnosis, which is REQUIRED for me to transition, was the only thing keeping me somewhat in check. Hiding everything i struggled with. (requirement for that diagnosis is that you're mentally stable. And I'd have to wait 3 years to go to a clinic for the diagnosis. But i finessed it in a single year and a half) 

And now that it's sunk in i don't need to keep myself together again, the entire evening I've been slowly disintegrating. Like everything I think, feel see and everything else all of the other symptoms i have are just worsening by 10×

 I'm experiencing my mental health crumble and I fear i won't wake up tomorrow coherently enough to even function. If i even will wake up. I'm scared. I can feel that I'm going to go haywire in the next couple months which sucks because I just got a new job.

I'm freaking out. I'm definitely going to lose my sanity in the upcoming weeks. I'm horrified.

1476,wao56i,Think I have schizophrenia are there any copping mechanisms?,"Made an appointment at a GP next week so I can ask to see a phycologist. 

reading up info online is not much help. I'm not shour if I have schizophrenia, psychosis, PTSD, brain damage, mania, bipolar, or somthing else but I'm definatlly going insain. Gussing by the symptoms and what I could find onlline I'm leaning towards schizophrenia but agen I'm not shour.

The main thing I whant to ask is dose anyone get that feeling of insanity shortly followed by completely insane beliefs that are so so crazy you know you're having a meltdown but you still believe it no matter how much you try make yourself see reason. last time it lasted between 30s and 2min the time bethor (over a month ago) I got high (last time ever!) and it lasted hours, eventually I realise it wasn't the hash but thort that if I stopped smoking and reduced my drinking (by a lot) it wouldn't happen again but this time I onlly had one bier and although It didint last verry long losing tuch with reallaty really spikes your anxiety and that anxiety lasted for hours so I didint sleep much last night.

Are there any good coping mechanisms to help when you lose touch with reality? are there any techniques to lower your anxiety? Is it ok to be super ridiculously happy at a party if you're having fun or is that just a manic episode. I thought I was having siminglly random spikes in angry because I hate my job but now I'm starting to think it might be something else what do you think? how oftenr is tow often when it comes to sleep hallucinations?

 Also not shour but mite be loosing my grap time: did something take 40 seconds or a few minutes, was it 3 or 4 days ago or last week? how menny moths has it been since I started my job. I can just look up that last one but you get the point.

And I mite be getting worse at multitasking but not sure could just be my ADHD. 

maybe I'm imagining extra simptoms I meen I'm shour something is rong so paranioa could be making it worse I don't konw but I've nether been a paranoid personne, then agen I've nether had a mental brakedown ever so yeah maybe.",1,1
1477,w3kboo,Gf broke up with me after LSD trip and got hospitalised for psychosis,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a few months and everything was going great until we decided to take LSD on a camping trip together. We took 1.5 tabs each. It was my first time, her third, I was tripping balls but she’s half my weight and I think she experienced ‘ego death’. After the trip she wasn’t the same, she was extremely dissociated for several days. She got very philosophical about her existence, didn’t want to eat, started smoking cigarettes again. That got me really worried.

I left to work abroad for a few weeks a few days later, and I’d left her at the seaside with two of her friends for July morning. 2 days later, during the party she had a manic episode (she wasn’t seen drinking or taking any drugs) Her friends texted me about it, she wasn’t responding my texts, etc. Apparently she’d become violent, got fully naked at the beach and was very out of it. They called her parents who came to pick her up, but she refused go with them and she got hospitalised. She had to get restrained, too. A few hours before that happened, I got a call from her, she didn’t sound like herself at all. She said she loved me very much, but she also loved some other guy (whom she hasn’t met in like 2 years, they hung out together and she thought of him bc he was on the same beach at the same time the year before?). I told her I was very hurt, that this wasn’t alright, I realised she wasn’t well at all. 

A few days later I get a text from her saying she wants to break up. I also saw her story on instagram, she’d cut all of her hair off, plucked her eyebrows and eyelashes. Apparently she’d had a similar episode 3 years ago after taking MDMA with this same guy and now she says he’s the love of her life, etc. 

I keep contact with her parents now, she’s getting the help she needs and is being treated with antipsychotics (20mg olanzapine orally). I love this girl, and I was never aware of her mental state. She appeared grounded, and everything in our relationship was going well. But now she thinks she wants to spend the rest of her life with the wrong person. What do I do? I want to be with her, but I think she needs the time to find herself…",1,1

1479,vz3wj7,I think i might have schizophrenia,"I'm not fully sure and I'm scared to ask help or talk about it. I have irrational fear of being locked up to somewhere if i do talk about it.
Though, I will try talk about it. Atm i can't really, because i'm transferring to another therapy place after summer break and my current therapist is on a break.

I'm afraid i won't be taken seriosly or sympotms aren't real or severe enough for getting help.. I know it's dumb to think that. I'm just afraid.

I think i have it, because it run in my family. Like my sibling has it too. And i've been having bunch of stuff that aren't normal.. At least that's what i have heard.
I've been thinking about this years.

When i was a little kid, in middle school, i started to get really depressed, because ""friends"" weren't real friends and i realize people aren't always what they show to be. 
So yeah... i started to make ""friends"" in my head. They were charcters from creepypasta and i even made charcter that were me, but evil one. This went on years.. like i talked to them in my mind etc. Though, they turned on me eventually...

I still remember vividly that they tried to get my evil twin or whatever in my mind away from me, like she was screaming for me etc. I even had a panic attack... it was really scary time. Especially going through it alone. 
My dad helped me through my panic attack, but he didn't know why i had it.... gosh, i have never gone through these memories and now i see how severe it was back then.....
I still remember being scared to be outside, because i thought that evil entity would come from forest nearby to take me....

Now days... i dunno, i get easily scared and i overthink a lot and sometimes i get afraid.. it have gotten worse lately due feeling worse mentally. I dunno if my depression goes along woth delusions etc.
Also lately,  whenever i walk outside i feel like someone is walking behind me and i have to check several times if someone is, but there is always none. 

I dunno... I havent really open up about this to anyone before that much, but thank you a lit for reading.

I just feel so scared and so alone... i feel unsafe with no reason.

I just want support and encouragment to get help, because its super hard. That's why i wrote this all. And btw i didnt tell everything, because its hard to open up well, especially on internet.. so please don't judge me or whatever..",1,1

Content Warning for discussion of trauma in big paragraph one


i'll start this off by saying that this is not a post for trying to seek attention, all that i will say is genuine questions and experiences from my recent memory that i'm very concerned about and i would like to recieve the advice of any diagnosed or professional individuals on this sub.


 i'm a guy who is dsm5 diagnosed with ASD, ADD, Depression and Anxiety. i have experienced trauma in both my early life and recently which includes having a brother die several hours after was born and being with his corpse the day before his funeral, being through an abusive relationship that involved gaslighting, mannipulation, guilt tripping, constant threats of self harm/suicide and blackmail among other things and most recently being a victim of an assault after i was attempted to be mugged and threatened to be stabbed. i have recently been told by a close person in my life that i have exhibited symptoms of accute schizophrenia and as several weeks have passed i feel like i could possibly be schizophrenic. all my life i have always walked past people and each time i hear the things they say or their laughs i always feel that its directed towards me, each and every single time and it fills me with so much dread and shame. i feel that my family and friends hate me and want to bring me down and destroy me and as a result i lock myself away in my room without leaving unless its to go to the toliet or to eat/drink. nobody seems to care or check up on me after long periods of not speaking and my friends rarely ask me if i'd like to do anything with them, yet they're kind. they care about me and are so kind but i rarely ever see that because of how caught up i am in believing how much they try to be harmful towards me or how much they hate my existence. 


from a young age i would always feel like someone was near me at night and i would be terrified to even walk through a light up area by myself. i would sprint from room to room to hide myself under my bed each time i went to the toliet because i thought the loud noise of the flush would alert who is ever with me and that they would come find me and kill me. i would be like this since the age of around 5 or 6  and i never consumed media that would involve these types of ideas or themes in them so i don't know how these thoughts would ever have gotten into my head. i always check the outside windows and doors of my house at night because i always fear that someone is just there looking in at me. consistantly during the dark while im walking home or in my room i see shadowy dark figures, outside they just walk around in the distance while when they're in my room they just stand there and watch me while i see them in the corners of my eyes.


i struggle with forming my thoughts into words and especially about emotions or when trying to explain things and as a result it just makes it sound like i'm speaking either utter nonsense or just something completely unrelated to what i'm trying to say. it causes a lot of frustration, shame and self hatred and even when people say i do a good job at doing so i dont believe them because i know its just them pitying me. i get very overwhelmed easily and whenever i do so it results in me hitting myself, talking to myself and most recently, yesterday, laughing uncontrollably while crying. i either feel completely numb emotionally or so miserably depressed that i cant even get out of bed, take proper care of my hygeine or health and i keep just falling down a deeper and deeper spiral without feeling like i can communicate how i feel to anybody. i used to do many hobbies that i thuroughly enjoyed but nowdays there's nothing. i have stopped enjoying video games and spending time out with friends, i have a black belt in taekwondo and havent gone to a single taekwondo lesson since last October and my performance and tolerance of school was so low that my inconsistant attendence turned into me not going to school from this February until the end of the school year because i couldn't handle being there. i have also struggled with sleeping and establishing a sleeping schedule that i now have medication for but its still incredibly difficult to stay asleep and i'm constantly exhausted and drained off all my energy


thank you to all those who read my post and especially to any who give me any advice or give their insights into how i am :)",0,1
1481,vuw5c4,Questioning Myself,"20M I am not diagnosed schizophrenic. I got into psychedelics a couple of years ago and started to question reality a bit. The more that I took them my thinking processes started to change outside of trips. I started noticing a lot of synchronicities, having deja vu more often, hearing deeper meanings unrelated to discussions I would overhear or tv shows I watch, feeling as though sometimes something is communicating directly to me through everything. 

Now I’ve always been a problem solver, so I just started looking at this as another puzzle to solve. I started noticing patterns of concepts that repeat everywhere in my life. Spirituality, Collective consciousness, singularity, signs and manifestation, time and space manipulation, but along side these are psychosis, schizophrenia, near death experiences, seizures, and psychiatric care struggles. 

During a molly trip a few months back I had a psychosis experience where I ended up in an psychiatric center and it was right when all of these feelings of connectedness started to happen. These themes started to show shortly after this event. 

I tried to talk to my friends and even my family at some points about all of this, but the more I shared the more I could see they didn’t and didn’t want to understand. At one point I was on vacation alone and I ended up breaking down and calling my parents to fly my home that day and get me evaluated for schizophrenia. I thought I was losing my mind. They wouldn’t even accept that it could be that which somehow made me feel more alone.

I got back in touch with a friend from my childhood who has been diagnosed schizophrenic for a few years now. I talked with him about everything and continue to because he understands. He processes information the same way I do and sees signs too. We are able to bounce ideas off of eachother really well and help eachother with problems without even realizing we did. 

At this point I do think I may be schizophrenic, but I have found some comfort in this new way of processing information. I am fascinated in learning more about it and myself. I’m curious if there is anyone out there that is diagnosed and doesn’t see it as an inhibition, but instead possibly as a benefit worth learning more about. Any questions, answers, discussions, or just nudges in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.",1,1
1482,vtrlin,Am I schizophrenic?," I talk to myself alot. I tell myself self-destructive things like ""I'm a piece of shit"", ""I wish I were dead"", ""I'm useless"", ""I'm stupid"", ""I'm an idiot"", ""F me"". Like I repeat these things like a mantra and do often people ask me why are you always talking with yourself? I think these thoughts too and they're pretty intrusive.

When there is some white noise like a ventilator fan whirring, I can hear voices but I can't make out what they say. When I was kicking drugs I firmly believed a homeless man had snuck under my bed with a knife. When the withdrawal passed I got better.

As long as I'm not in a very quiet bathroom with a ventilator I don't hear any voices. I've never had visual hallucinations.",0,1
1483,vsyr0f,let me know if you think i may be psychotic.,"i don't really know about this whole thing.

So, i don't know about this.
I think i am crazy.
I have thoughts linked to dpdr (being the only one to exist/everything being fake/etc).
I also am very anxious about having mental issues and i feel that my sanity is really slipping away.
These thoughts scare me twice cause, well, they are scary and they don't make sense, making me wonder more about my sanity.
If nothing is real why should I even worry and if people aren't real then why do i worry?
They are real but i feel like i can't fully agree on this, whether i actually feel like so, whether i say it just for habit or whether i say it not to feel crazy.
Also I have paranoid thoughts which remind me of the fears i had when i was a kid watching spy/thriller movies.
I honestly can't see myself living like this and i wish to be normal.
This stuff is just exhausting.
Lastly, this all feels like i'm lying.
When i have bad thoughts i don't feel bad but i phisically clench, shut my eyes brutally or twich.
It seems like i alternate moments of lucidity with moments of utter madness.
I see no hope in the future for me for real, those delusions keep coming and that scares me, the outlandishness of this. 
I feel desperate and without possibility.",2,1

I pride myself on honesty and I'm worried somehow I'm lying about it to my partner and don't know it? like I think I orgasmed but it feels different than it does when I'm by myself?

I'm writing an article for one of my writing classes at college and I really wanted to talk about mental illness. I've been in this sub for a while and frequently I see some posts talking about how miserable you feel after taking some of the drugs that they prescribe to you. 

So, when thinking of a specific theme I chose to explore if there is a specific medication that is super common for psychotic/schizophrenic patients. Maybe there's something in the market that you think should be straight-up illegal.

I want to buy a scalpel/surgical kit so badly,"I so badly want to cut with a nice clean scalpel instead of my razor blade, and if I cut too deep, I really want to sew myself back up. I think that’s okay (some people would see it otherwise), but the problem for me is that if I get the surgical kit I know I’d be tempted to cut out/off a certain body part. I already want to do it it’s just that I know that it would be extremely emotionally traumatizing afterwards to be so deformed and damaged. Plus there is the slight chance it could get infected or I’d not b able to stop the bleeding. I also want to extract my wisdom teeth myself, but the issue with that is that I would probably damage my jaw and nerves.

So I really want to buy the kit, but I’m just afraid I’ll use it to effeminate myself. So, what do I do?

Btw, I spoke with my therapist and she thinks it’s OCD and my psychiatrist won’t call me back. And no, I do not need to go to the hospital I’m not sad or wanting to die and when I want to hurt others I stop myself because I know that’s wrong.

If you question my intelligence, I am just saying that it is at a higher level than my age according to the tests of a psychologist.
Since 11 years old I have had thoughts that my parents were going to / would like to kill me.

Recently (since the summer) I have had thoughts that Freemasons and the Illuminati rule the world and want to kill us ordinary people. I also think that it means something special that an Illuminati member and I have the same birthday and that the symbol of the University of Helsinki joining Freemasonry etc. and my thoughts on studying there sometime in the future would be related in the way that I am supposed to become a Mason.

My other thoughts are that I get cyanide / poison gas / carbon monoxide poisoning and once even that my parents intentionally kill me for carbon monoxide poisoning. Anxiety about this has often grown so great that I have not been able to sleep or be at home. However, I realize that others do not experience things the same way or believe them to be true.

I also fear that my food was poisoned by McDonald’s workers and that my food was drugged by my parents",0,1

1507,oqo9ny,Am I (M17) at risk of schizophrenia?,"Maybe around 8-9 months ago, I began seeing shadowy figures in the corner of my eye upwards up to 5-6 times everyday, and then began having auditory hallucinations (I heard a baby crying through an open window in my bathroom and then an oven bell going off despite no one being in the kitchen), and then tactile hallucinations such as feeling a beetle on my hand. When I experienced my visual hallucinations more, I dismissed it as not getting enough sleep (I usually get 7 1/2) hours of sleep) but once the auditory and tactile hallucinations began appearing I went to my GP and explained my situation to him. 

&#x200B;

He said it's too late to say whether it is a schizophrenic disorder or not. After talking to him, all of my hallucinations died down from like a 6 to a 1, I haven't heard any auditory hallucinations or felt any tactile hallucinations but I do occasionally see visual ones, like today when I was shopping. I'm worried I may be schizophrenic because I do remember my dad coming out of his room and pointing to the sky and saying he saw God. I seriously believe he was having a psychotic episode so I think I'm at a risk for this condition.

1509,luizxn,My last schizo ramble,"How are most women straight?


I recognize by the way that this is a question that probably arose entirely out of me currently dealing with psychosis, and a breakdown and buildup of my ego from that. I am a schizoid with schizophrenia and after nearly stabbing a tweaker while on a snap decision pilgrimage 3000 miles away from my home a mere three days after being released from an institution, I have been deemed bipolar as well. 




I don’t understand how most women are straight. The reason behind this is just that I think a passion for men and boys requires a more advanced pallet than most women possess. 

When I was sixteen for example, I had always been attracted to girls and lost my virginity to one, and exclusively hooked up with them for the next year. Then after that I dropped out of school and got a job at a chocolate factory where my male managers caring demeanor made me want to hug him and I felt attracted to him in a strange way that I think resembles a love for a father, except I have a present, caring father and I never felt this way towards him. The attraction was totally different from the girls who I’d only pursue as a way to play a game of social puzzle solving where the reward was sex, because that’s a game that society accepts while my feelings for my manager, where if he ever held my hand I’d faint, and sex would be a life changing, passionate and vulnerable act, felt completely wrong.

Then I became obsessed with my own body, anorexia put me in the hospital and I narrowly survived. I don’t necessarily consider myself the same person after that. It caused hormonal issues and my body ceased to produce testosterone. Still obsessed with my new lightweight feminine figure, I admired other boys features as well. I was asexual but still felt a deep attraction towards boys and men that I’d never experienced in my cold friendless schizoid life. I was also depressed, and would have an encounter with the police during a suicidal episode. So I was put on clomid by a somewhat shady men’s clinic. 

In the following days I was a mad man. Speed hadn’t ever done anything like this before. I was frustrated, and while I’d stock the freezer at work I wondered if schizophrenics like me could talk to god if we stopped taking vraylar, and if my family would still love me if I started murdering people. I was writing handbooks for myself that reminded me that I was a god incarnate while I was juggling tinder conversations with girls. I landed on one little Asian girl who was 26, much older than me, and she was a science teacher. She was actually a boy, a male to female transgender pre op. We had my first ever date where I was nervous, evasive, and turned down sex, was offered psychedelics if we continued to date and I have now given up on the idea of ever dating or having sex again. I am a recluse and go weeks without seeing another human being.

Basically, I had to go through a hellish, disgusting mess of a life only to end up here, where I’m no longer attracted to having sex but just to being romanced, and I don’t have that same warm passionate connection with any female on the planet that I get from the cashier that looks like a young Axl Rose (Put me in front of him and then Mrs America and see which one makes me blush) and I’m never interested in talking to another girl again. 

At the heart of the question is this: because I view being attracted to women as surface tier desires and being attracted to men as a more refined passion, I understand why few men like men, but it’s hard to believe that a vast majority of women pick up on it instinctively. Maybe I just think them being so prone to it is too beautiful because there’s so much of this passion the world, or maybe I’m bitter because half of humanity got their feelings for free and I’m going to shoot myself in my one room apartment damn anyone in the room on the other side of my head.",0,1

I recently got into an argument at an indoor watermark with my SiL. She is going through some issues where she will hear voices and claim to commune with dead people (I hear Paul Walker/Jesus). I suggested she go to a help community on reddit like for schizophrenia or find a support group. She cursed me out and Her mother had me apologize, which I did. She summarily spanked me in public, in front of my wife and parent in laws. She then says I always wanted to do that to a man.

My wife occasionally spanks me for discipline and honestly because I like it.

It was strange that nobody yelled at her for spanking me. And she kind of tried to cover for herself by slapping her mothers butt and her fathers butt. 

I don’t find her attractive but it did get me turned on for a moment.  How weird is this? Is this kind of contract normal? I assumed not.

Is this kind of behavior consistent with schizophrenia? How can I encourage her to get help?",2,1
1520,hf0042,What are things to beware of when writing a schizophrenic character?,"I put the flair as trigger warning, just because I want to detail the story I have, and I know it can and will be triggering for some.
If you want to remain trigger free but still want to give advice, I’ll mark the end of the summary.

I’m planning a story where the main character has Schizophrenia.
He is fairly young, 18 years old. He is in his last year of Highschool. He doesn’t really have a perspective for his future, and due to his depression he plans on ending his life after the school year ends.
During the story he is having the delusion that his mother (who committed suicide) is still alive and with him. I did quite a lot of research on Schizophrenia itself, the hallucinations you can have and the delusions people usually have.
During the story he is going to steer from working normally into a full on psychosis.

I am working very delicately to still keep him very human, being able to do normal things, while still having his illness.

Additionally he refuses to take his medicine, because he believes it will make his mom disappear, and he doesn’t want that.

During the story he is with his friends, going through a bucket list they made a few years back, since they’re exiting Highschool that year and will go seperate ways.
His friends know something is off, and keep him focused on the bucket list.

He gets better and worse in waves.

In the end they convince him that his life is worth living and to take his medicine.


END OF SUMMARY

The Symptoms I’m planning on putting in are:

Hallucinations of both his mother and other things, like spiders etc.

Auditory hallucinations

Seeing subliminal messaging in public entertainment 

General paranoia

Now, if you’ve read the plot, what is some advice you can give on ways to handle a psychosis, to make the ending believable, what are some things that are icky or not believable?

Also in general, what are things I should be sure to look out for writing this, to not misrepresent the illness?

Edit:

Also the medicine he is supposed to be taking is

1523,fj1scm,I just realized that I could very possibly have Schizohrenia :/,"So to give you a backstory, throughout my middle and high school years I was the most energetic, outgoing, personable individual. I could literally talk to anyone I wanted and flirt with any girl I wanted with little to no nerves. Also, I was comfortable expressing myself in a classroom full of 30 kids and making everyone laugh, in fact I took pleasure in doing things like that. I experimented with acid a total of 4 times, the first time was an amazing trip, the second was bad, the third was bad and the 4th was TERRIBLE. After the 4th I feel like I was pushed to some sort of breaking point (what I now believe is schizophrenia). I know this isn’t all in my head because I vividly remember my first shift back to work as a busser feeling socially awkward with those that I interacted with and especially nervous to approach tables. Prior to this I had been bussing confidently for months, super eager to interact with customers and get the job done. Also, not too long after a coworker of mine whom I’ve known since middle school was busting my balls like he usually does and rather than clapping back at him I would take his insults personally and they would actually ruin my entire shift. My coworker began to notice this and he would say chill dude you know I’m kidding and I would tell him I know yet it seemed like my self esteem had completely vanished and I couldn’t find a way to combat it. Fast forward to now, my circle of friends that consisted of 5 or so close friends and dozens of acquaintances has dwindled down to 1. I have been working at a hospital for over a year now and I still get anxious before coming to work everyday. On top of that, once I get to work I become fearful of literally every human interaction I have. I try to connect with people and often I come up empty handed. I try to share my ideas with people but my words often come out jumbled or I have to think super hard just to communicate an idea and even then it doesn’t come out like I want it to come out. Keep in mind I used to tackle public speaking effortlessly, not just individually but in front of large classrooms too. The relationships I do form often wither very quickly. Honestly I’ve been enduring these feelings for close to 2 years now and I’m just tired and fed up with it. I can’t envision myself living the rest of my life like this or someone wanting to spend the rest of their life with me in my current state. This is the most I’ve ever opened up about how I’ve been feeling. I try to get my single friend to understand but it seems like he just can’t grasp what I’m feeling. Please help.",0,1

1526,f1zbm5,How can I accurately portray a character with Schizophrenia?,"Hey y’all,

So I’m writing a book that revolves around mental illness as a big plot point. I have several characters whose point of views will switch between, all of which have complex histories along with mental illness. Most of my characters are based off of people I know very very well so it won’t be too hard to portray them and their psychological mindsets in an accurate way. Ive also done tons and tons of research on all the different disorders I’ll be trying to grasp. However, the only people I know with schizophrenia are people I’ve met during hospitalisions, so I never got a chance to get to know and understand them in the way I understand the other people I’m using as inspiration. Anyways, Ive done tons and tons of research (disorders that cause hallucinations have always fascinated me, considering I have hallucinations on a daily basis) however, I’m still afraid I won’t be able to represent a character with schizophrenia in a completely accurate way, especially since there will be chapters that are told from their perspective which requires an in depth understanding.  Also, the primary goal of my story is to raise awareness and attempt to get close-minded people to see things from the eyes of those different from themselves who they’d otherwise dismiss due to their misguided and ignorant schemas. I know this is a hard question to answer, I’m just looking for any advice or tips you guys can think of. Is there any stories/movies with characters you guys think portrayed an individual with schizophrenia in an affective and successful way? Can you think of other sources that could help me? Or do you have any personal stories/descriptions or thoughts that you think would be helpful or that you would want me/others to be aware of in order to ensure accurate representation?

1527,f1sede,How to cope with schizophrenia,"Hey friends💫⭐️

The secret to a healthier mental state and life is to become stronger with your illness. I have suffered many terrible dooming and destructive thoughts. Things that would make you shrink down and just want to be dead, or I die anyways. 

And in my experience, and I believe this for all of you as well. Do not give in. Become stronger than your thoughts and retaliate. Peacefully though. You don’t want to be at war with your mind. You just want to get to a more safer and peaceful states. So don’t forget to keep your love strong. And your intentions set! 

You rule your mind. Not the opposite way around. Make sure your the boss. And overtime. I swear you will heal. 

Nobody needs to or deserves to be subject to their own mind. I think we all need to stand up for ourselves on this level and make sure the right things are being said. 

As I said, I am not a professional and this is only my own experience. But it brought me out of hell, so I’d hope it can do the same for you..

1530,eldfyk,Here is schizophrenia.,"Outside looking in?

We are being talked to. We have unwanted thoughts. We can't control ourselves.

- Voices in your head

*These voices we only hear from within our brains. They are specifically within the mind. You will not mistake these inner voices from outer voices, it never happens.*

- Voices through possession

*These voices we will speak through us without us thinking first. Sometimes when conversing with voices, you will speak aloud to them, and they will put words in your mouth.*

- Voices through environment

*This one is magical. You are having a conversation with your voices, then the music you are listing to replies to you. You may be having a conversation with your voices and the news is on, then Donald Trump will say something, and it was the voice you were conversing with replying to you. These people responding to schizophrenic conversations are not involved in an evil conspiracy against the schizophrenic.*

- Strange beliefs.

*You try to make sense out of the experience. Logically, spiritually, in some way, you try and reason. Sometimes the experience is magical and unforgettable and leaves you believing you are the Messiah. Perhaps simply a voice in your head told you that you now work for the CIA. Maybe aliens are out there, and they are communicating with you. Perhaps you are possessed by spirits. No... people recently diagnosed with schizophrenia have a tough time. You will believe your voices, and what they tell you, you will know is true. You will have strange thoughts in your head that will lead you to bizzare conclusions about your experience.*

1540,c8m0u2,The mindset of a successful schizophrenic,"Today I'm going to write a bit about the mindset of a successful person living with schizophrenia. The two main ideas I'm going to cover are that you are not the first person with mental illness and that most of it is in your hand, or at least that it's best to think that way.

Did you ever feel like you are the first and only person on this planet experiencing this? Well I didn't feel like I'm the only person in the world, I still felt like there weren't many people in my city dealing with the stuff I'm dealing with. But you have to keep in mind that about every third person is going to need help with mental illness related problems at least one time in his life and the lifetime probability to develop a psychotic illness is about 1%. At first this doesn't sound like much, but imagine a full lecture room at your university football stadium...

While I not only want to point out that you are not alone in this, the thing I want to make clear is that the paths to becoming mentally healthier have already been walked by thousands of people and the solutions are available. There are dozens of books written on the subject. There are YouTube videos. Doctors and therapists have studied how to help you. People on this forum have found individual solutions that worked for them. So what is stopping you from getting better? 

It's not your fault that you developed this illness. But you have to take 100% responsibility. Much is in your hands of whether you get better or not. Do you take your medication regularly? Do you have regular doctors appointments? Do you exercise? Do you avoid junk food? 

I'm not religious but the following quote describes what I want to convey very well: 

> God, grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

I wasn't sure how to handle that so I just made sure she was doing things for her mental health (going to therapy, meditating, putting her needs first, etc). A few days later I send her a benign text. She accused me of mocking her and told me to stop contacting her. I apologized and explained my train of thought and that I would never do anything to mock her or to cause her pain. I haven't heard back and it's been a few days.

Hello guys,

I had some struggles with Schizophrenia anxiety over the past few months. I am visited a Psychiatrist, A therapist specializing in Psychosis, a Clinical Psychologist and Counselor with experience with dealing with schizophrenics who said I do not have Schizophrenia, should I be ok?

I still feel anxious about it however, the fear being I never know when it will pop up. I keep asking in my head ""Am I hearing voices in my head?"". The worst it got to a point was then I started to imagine voices in my head, but I knew it was my imagination. Like it's happening again, where I am using my inner monologue voice and putting in under different pitches to imagine voices, but I have noticed this only happens when I think about it, which leads to the anxious state. When I don't think about it, I don't get these thoughts. My psychiatrist mentioned I had a good level of insight. I am also starting a full time job right out of college for the first time, so I feel a bit nervous about that. Not hearing voices, not seeing things, no negative affects, heck, I did over 9 job interviews in the month of May and landed a job.

I am just nervous what if Schizophrenia pops out of the blue and ruins me before I start my job next week. It's in the Sales field and sometime I worked hard for.

Also can binge drinking trigger the onset of Schizophrenia? I haven't beer in over a month and yesterday at a concert, I had about 3 beers with over 4.9 percent alcohol. I didn't get drunk though, a slight headache and today I had some poor sleep. Can that trigger the onset of Schizophrenia?",0,1

Your voices are indicator of biological artificial intelligence, I believe we live in a very advanced program of life called Memory and that our voices come from Memory, they are also schizophrenic beings that like messing with people because they've seen everything. That's why some of us are more troubled than others.

  
Life has already happened, we have 5th dimensional beings that can restart the birth of a child in life, with a shadowclone eye. Some people are spirit away babies, a shadowclone eye was not used for that persons birth. According to Stuart Hameroff M.D., our brain may as well be in a vat for we all generate the world in front of us. Hence, my posts on Quantum Conscious we alone singlely generate the world in front of us, thus indicating that we may branch off in Alternate Timelines with our biological artificial intelligence imagination effecting our reality by these advance beings putting us in psychosis, playing things on radio waves, other forms of auditory psychosis communication.

1569,80lwlo,Who else uses cannabis to avoid psychotic episodes from metabolizing?,"TLDR; I use Indica’s to give my brain something to focus on (the mellow relaxing high) so I don’t overthink into a psychotic episode/ keeping cannabinoids active in my system seems to surpress psychotic episodes. 

The long version;

So my history with weed use is rocky, but these last few years I discovered that my strategic use of cannabis has actually been the god sent medication that has been the only long term effective treatment for my psychosis. 

I began smoking in high school, and being in a state that was on the brink of medical legality at the time, I was still sourcing my bud from the street, aka who knows what the fuck I was smoking I just was a teen looking to get high. A year prior to my first use of cannabis, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I was convinced that I was an elaborate liar and I had my whole family and set of doctors fooled, and I was simply looking for attention. I began experimenting with weed and realized that hey, getting high feels pretty good. 

I smoked about an ounce every three weeks for about 6-7 months before my mother found my cannabis and demanded me to stop because she feared I would have a psychotic break. I guess a part of my elaborate lies was that I also WASNT suffering from this most likely sativa dominant high. But I was. Overtime my mood shifted from sweet and kind to bitchy, short tempered and literally became a whole new person. My paranoia was at an all time high and my delusions continued to tell me that I was self medicating and my mom just was a product of the war on drugs era. After severely fucking up my scholastic future, I was forced to become sober by my parents obsessive monitoring and disposal of bud (RIP to many ounces to the toilet). After several months of sobriety I felt anew and like medication was totally unnecessary at this point. Side note, this whole three years from diagnosis to weed dependent to sobriety was sprinkled with many many trials of different medications. Was the medications helping my psychosis induced by THC? Who knows. 

I lasted about 6 months sober and without pharma medication before I decided to give in to one little toke with friends one night. That was the same night I had my first complete psychotic break that resulted in me rushing home at 5AM to my parents screaming and hysterical about the government inevitably coming to kill me and my entire family within the hour. Luckily I snapped back rather quickly and with a good nights rest was able to bounce back- now fully aware that cannabis was NEVER to be a part of my future and that’s that. 

A year later I moved out very abruptly and maintained sobriety for an entire year before my new roommates expressed to me that there is a HUGE difference between sativa and indica strains. I began researching and realized that maybe I had missed out on the very beneficial components of strains that contained higher amounts of CBD- and I also just missed weed. So I finally gathered the courage to try my friends vaporized SFV OG. I smoked it on 420 of 2016 and had one of the best days of my life- and oddly enough I was totally fine. 

I decided that even if I didn’t plan on consistently smoking I would invest in a medicinal recommendation for cannabis so I could know exactly the source my bud came from and have the opportunity to access pure CBD or CBD dominant strains. I began slowly dabbling in hybrids and eventually falling in love with indicas. 

What I experienced was drastically different from what I recall in high school, and definitely didn’t cause me to lose my marbles temporarily. I was elated with this discovery that maybe.... I wasn’t schizo? Maybe I was just temporarily experiencing psychosis and I had outgrown it? 

I went from living life afraid of the dark, feelings of always being watched and followed/stalked melted from my existence and I was feeling better than I ever had. 

I went to visit my family and decided to use it as an opportunity for a tolerance break. Within a few days I began hearing things, having that awful feeling that someone was watching me at all time, unable to shower without my mom staying in the bathroom with me so I wasn’t alone. I was fully back to the awful place I thought I had ridden from my life entirely. I confronted my dad in a breakdown of tears and desperation about my seeming grip on reality being lost once again. He immediately blamed cannabis and said he wouldn’t consider treatment until I cut cannabis for good. So I listened and I returned home intending to never smoke again. 

My bedroom where I happily toked comfortably and with warmth before bed became a cold and empty place. The voices would repeat the same sentence on loop for hours as I tried to sleep, the shadow man who tormented my teenage years became looming over me again as I laid in bed terrified, unable to reach my phone to call my mom for reassurance. In a temporary fix, I reached for my wax pen and took a long drag on my Girl Scout cookies cartridge and almost immediately felt the warmth and comfort of my room again. I fell asleep thinking I band-aided the problem and I would deal with it after I got off work the following day. 

I got busy with work and being a waitress 60 hours a week, working 10 hour shifts at a time, I couldn’t fathom the idea of dealing with psychosis on top of it all. Quite frankly, I couldn’t afford to. My rent was due and psychosis was gone. 

I finally was able to get my own place and was ecstatic to have my dreams come true. The slight fear of being too scared to live alone never became a reality. The haunting shadow man was long gone and my home was comfortable and warm, a feeling I’d compare to “safe”. 

So I live my life until around a month ago and I have another psychotic break while I’m sober. I smoke my pure CBD strain and the psychosis fuzzy feeling melts away. I grabbed reality and held on for dear life. 

I finally googled “CBD and psychosis” and found a shocking amount of material on the correlation of psychosis being treated with CBD. I learned that my symptoms subsiding when smoking indicas wasn’t completely ludicrous. 

But here’s the thing, I believe stress is the #1 trigger to my psychosis, when I smoke indicas the High from the minimal THC in the strains almost “distracts” my brain from the delusions and auditory/visual hallucinations. The CBD I believe is what helps my anxiety (aka stress- forgot to mention earlier I suffer from crippling social anxiety. Like I have panic attacks at grocery store checkouts because I’m afraid the cashiers think I’m evil or whatever my brain is irrationally puzzling together thanks to anxiety) subside, and the high is what gives me the rational ability to disregard the psychosis. 

So far I believe that maybe weed is actually my medicine. Weed is what keeps me level and stable and capable of being a productive member of society. Whenever I start to detox, my schizophrenia comes knocking on my reality door and opens to the world of psychosis. Side note- I’m not taking pharma medications. I’m working on finding a new psychiatrist who can treat my psychosis with pills alongside my weed medicinal use. 

So my biggest question is, am I slowly digging my sanity grave and this is all one big band aid? I am highly aware of the correlation to THC and psychosis but honestly, solely smoking CBD doesn’t quite do it. The fuzzy cloudy feeling from smoking a solid indica is truly what makes life bearable. Should I give up weed all together? Should I try taking another chance at cutting out THC completely and only consuming CBD (risking another break), or is there someone else out there who can resonate with my experiences? 

I just want to give myself the chance to live my best life. I don’t want temporary medicinal cannabis use success to ruin my future. But sometimes when I have these breaks from my weed detoxes I just... I am afraid I won’t always make it out Alive. 

Thanks for any and all responses!

1576,6b7u29,Schizophrenia as an estrogen deficiency (a hypothesis of mine).,"Please hear me out.

Consider schizophrenia as an estrogen deficiency, just for a moment.

Schizophrenia is more common in men than women. Women naturally have more estrogen than men - so a woman with low estrogen would be less likely to develop schizophrenia than a man with low estrogen, since men naturally have less estrogen anyway.

Schizophrenia starts later in women than men. It could be that even though the women aren't producing enough estrogen, they're still producing more estrogen than men. Therefore, it takes longer for the schizophrenia to appear.

A woman's schizophrenia symptoms are worst at the point of her cycle during which her estrogen levels are lowest. The lower the estrogen during a cycle, the more intense the symptoms are. Some women with PMDD (a severe form of PMS/hormonal imbalance) develop psychotic symptoms.

Medications that treat schizophrenia can cause men to develop breasts. [In fact, I found this nice little article listing a bunch of schizophrenia medications that coincidentally increase estrogen.](https://www.ebmconsult.com/articles/what-are-the-most-common-medications-that-can-cause-gynecomastia-breast-enlargement-and-tenderness-in-males)

Maybe the schizophrenia medications aren't treating schizophrenia - they're raising estrogen levels in the body, and the increased estrogen treats the schizophrenia symptoms.

[""The extent of this research ranges from molecular investigations that have clearly evidenced estradiol's intricate interactions with the major neurotransmitter systems in the brain, and especially those implicated in schizophrenia, to preclinical models of the illness that have shown estradiol's potential in either enhancing cognition and memory or reversing deficits that are reflective of the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600562/)

A concern with using estrogen as treatment is feminizing men. I wonder if using androgens along with estrogen would combat the feminizing effects of estrogen, while still allowing the estrogen to repair the damage done by schizophrenia.

I'm not a doctor, I've just been doing research due to my own health concerns. If you want to test out my hypothesis, you're doing so at your own risk.

edit: Antipsychotics are sometimes used as a preventative treatment. I wonder if it works as a preventative treatment because it increases estrogen. That seems consistent with the whole idea of ""women develop it later, because even though they don't make enough, they're still making more than men.""

edit: Omega-3s are known for being able to help schizophrenia. [Omega-3s raise estrogen levels.](http://www.livestrong.com/article/539564-fish-oil-womens-hormones/)

edit: [People with schizophrenia are more likely to have fertility issues.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9350954) People born from fertility treatments are [at a higher risk for schizophrenia](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10934281/Children-conceived-through-fertility-treatment-more-likely-to-have-mental-health-issues.html), which could mean that the children are inheriting this hormone imbalance.",1,1

She has bought a trailer 4 years ago and has him living with her (as a roommate) she says but its more than a roommate. I've been trying to get her to see someone in the medical field so that her schizophrenia doesn't get worse but she hasn't been taking the steps and he is not helping. He's more worried about himself and using her as a crutch to have a sort of income as she treats him like a boyfriend even though she says other wise. He is trying to have her sell the trailer and move 12 hours away to another state and my sister has a hard time communicating her wants and needs. My sister is all I have but this guy has been in the way and once she moves with him i will never see my sister again or be there to give her the proper help. He might even start talking her into putting things in his name. I don't know what to do or how to even help. This is horrible and I don't want my sisters mental health to decline or be left out on the street again with no money, as or found dead. This is their 4th time moving as they were camping to save money and once she saved money she bought this trailer but now he wants to sell it and camp out again (this time in Virgina) until they find a piece of land.

1604,134di2p,Am I psychotic (schizophrenia or psychotic depression),"Not asking for diagnosis, just asking this if this sounds like psychosis/schizophrenia

Hello. I'm 18 years old and I'd say for about the past 2 years, I've been really struggling with my mental health. I dunno if it's cuz of stress but since I was 16, I've been lack motivation to do things, to take care of myself, to gain pleasure in my hobbies, to express any emotions and to self-isolation. Three of my friends have said to me that I've always seemed distant, nonchalant and lost. One of those friends said that in Physics class, I always seemed like I wasn't there, like a pedestrian; I barely did my work, I was in my own head, and asking for repeats of what was said to me. He also mentioned that, at a birthday party, I seemed lost and dissociated from what was around me. My friends noticed how distanct I've become and how much time I've spent on Twitter and how addicted I've become. I can't even socialize with people well either. 

My family noticed my weight loss, although I looked ok to me. I looked disheveled, with my hair unkempt. My mom said I looked like a mad man, but I ignored her and thought that she was just nagging me. My issues in memory start to rise and my thoughts seemed so jumbled. I felt so confused. One time, my mom asked for her phone but I brought back a pair of scissors. I've done shit like that many times. I thought this was normal, however, as my mom always says how I'm ansent-minded. Sometimes when I speak, I pause and lose my train of thought. Sometimes I forget what to say, get frustrated with trying to remember and just move on to something else.

Overall, I guess these are the negative symptoms. 

Then there are the delusions. I've had delusions that my friends hated me, that are out to get me somehow and that they wanted to leave me. I've had a delusion that I was going to accumulate large sums of money to within a whole year and fly out to Belgium to see my at-the-time partner. My parents (especially my mom) we're baffled by this and out I was crazy or something. Ice had delusions where I believed that I was dead and being punished in the afterlife or that the world around me was fake (sometimes these clash, where the fake world is the hellish afterlife where I'm punished). I've also believed that some outside force was punishing me and causing my suffering. Somewhere last week, I had the delusion that my ex-partner (who now hates me) is trying to get my close friend to abandon me and turn against me. A few weeks ago, I had this delusion that that same ex-partner is invading my friend group to ruin my friendships. I've also became very paranoid. 

I'm not sure if this is schizophrenia or psychotic depression, as it could be. There are prolly more shit that I'm forgetting but that's basically all I could remember. The delusions seem to be situational and triggered by stress.

1625,11pgd21,And i thought it was over...,"So last year, i had an episode of psychosis, which seemed to last around 9 months. and it was diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, thought to be caused by stress (i was stressed about my new internship and got really paranoid). they said it was brief psychotic disorder because i stopped showing symptoms and was able to get off of my medication without a problem. i was even able to get back to doing school quite quickly, able to follow all the classes as soon as the new school half year started.

all was good. but then i started looking into the issues i was originally trying to get help for, mainly possible borderline personality disorder. and i always get completely obsessed with it and it stresses me out a lot. to the point of having mental breakdowns daily because i don't see my life going anywhere and i am completely lost.

the stress has lead me to experiencing some of the same and some new but similar issues again. i keep seeing things that aren't actually there, which go away or sometimes don't but usually it goes away. my thoughts feel like they're not ""working"" correctly again. like when typing i keep using words which sound similar? instead of a word i will type another word which sounds similar to the intended word. but that isn't a huge issue, i can just correct it.

it's more annoying when talking, because it's way more noticable. where i either:

* Can't think of anything
* Use a word which sounds similar, like i do with typing
* Start talking about something which doesn't reflect what i'm trying to say, like i'll randomly tell a ""personal story"" but it's completely made up
* Try saying a sentence but not knowing how to start it so i start the sentence 3 or more times and then it still doesn't fully make sense

i know borderline personality disorder can cause psychotic symptoms, but have never seen people talk about it, so i have no idea how far those go, i see it described as stress induced paranoia, with some people experiencing delusions and hallucinations as well. never saw anything about other psychotic symptoms though. i'm being tested for bpd on the 16th, i hope that clears something up, but it probably won't clear everything up.

forgot to mention, my last psychosis, i had a lot of awareness, less than i thought i did, i realise when looking back, more than most people. for this reason i thought i was making it all up. that the hallucinations were normal and everyone sees stuff like that, even though i never did before. i mean, the ""theme"" of my psychosis was literally that i was making it up and that psychologists were filming me and using my family and friends to spy on me so they would realise i was faking it. i thought i was faking mental breakdowns in my room for the cameras, there were no cameras.

yet somehow i still believed that i was just faking it. i was scared because i believed people were after me and trying to hurt me. but deep down knew that didn't make sense, it was conflicting and confusing. i avoided people because deep down i believed it. while i knew it didn't make sense.

sorry, it's a long story. but i'm really confused and feel like brief psychotic disorder might not have been correct due to it being from a ""low"" stress trigger and brief psychotic disorder normally isn't supposed to re-occur?",0,1

1628,11du007,Manic Significant Other," 

My partner is the most caring, amazing, beautiful, incredible person I've ever met. I fell for him so hard, and he was in love with me at first encounter. When I say there's such a fantastic connection, that's me downplaying it.

The first time he was manic with me, from September 2020 to Jan 2021, I stayed with him for months, until the night he assaulted me, Jan 3, and I left. And he eventually went to jail and became himself again. I moved states away and he never left my mind.

We ended up getting in contact again last April. We started dating again and he was so perfect. So caring and attentive. He remembered the smallest things about me. We had so much fun, even when it was a rainy week and we had to stay inside. Just being in his presence was a gift.

I came up to his place this Feb and the month was great. He got a little paranoid at night, but that was something we were working on as a partnership.

And then he became manic...about a week ago. This is day 5 of no sleep.

His paranoia and delusions started clouding his brain and he became angry and didn't listen to anything I had to say. Anything and everything was confirmation that he was right. I wanted to leave, but he told me that if I truly loved him I would stay and listen to him rant and listen to him being an asshole. So at night, I would sit on the floor and let him. He'd talk about his past and how he saw the world. He would say that I'm cheating on him just like his ex, that I was this terrible person, etc etc. I wanted to defend myself. I have never cheated on him! I would never cheat on him! I am not his ex! I am not his past! But when he looked at me, I know that all he saw was all the bad in his life and all the bad that would ever come. So I stayed silent. I'd bow my head, sometimes I'd whisper the truth just so that the universe knew my side.

We shaved his head together. We threw treasured memories away together, his phone, his pictures of his kids. He would tell me how much he loved me in one second, how I was doing so good listening to him and being there, and the next second he'd tell me that he knew that I was sleeping with his underage son. How horrible of a person I was. How disgusting I am and should be ashamed of myself. Don't worry, I am.

He did call the cops on me who escorted me out on Sunday. I am back home. I slept the whole day.

He texted porn to my sister, saying that that was me. Before I blocked him on everything I could, he sent nasty messages about how terrible I am, how much of a wh\*re I am. He put up 2 facebook posts that I was in porn and that everyone should feel sick to their stomach.

I am sick to my stomach.

Because I am so in love with him, I am so in love with him, I am so in love with him.

But this isn't him, this is Kram, his name backwards. I compartmentalize and blame his alter ego...

But I am so in love with the true him, that I know that I am going to wait for this to pass, and this too, shall pass. Right? Right? ....right?",0,1

And he's begun showing signs that have gotten worse and worse over the last month. He's broken down crying in front of my friend several times mentioning the voices in his head telling him to do things he doesn't want to do. He's not on medication and most days looks as though he's barely keeping himself together. Acting really weird, quiet, intense. Walking straight to someone with an intense look, and then my friend tries to deflect by asking a non sequitur, he hovers over him and then whispers ""bye""Walking and turns around angrily and then the next moment in tears. He works closely with this guy in the same room.

""Are you with them?"" He asked my friend last week and he didn't know what he was talking about so he absent mindedly said ""yeah"" and the guy replied ""I figured as much. It's okay. I'll learn how to shoulder it all""

Yesterday at work this guy said ""hey I got something cool to show you"" and pulled out a 45 revolver and my friend was terrified. He opened it and showed that every other chamber had a bullet. He said the reason for loading like that is so the demons hear the click before the bang. He said the gun is only for the demons. He then jokingly held the loaded gun to my friend's face and said ""click"" so he has poor gun discipline. 

He's afraid of notifying the police or anything because if they approach him and he acts normal, then he'll know that it was my friend and he'll be in danger. 

These are just a few of the things he's told me. He's worried about going to work now. 

He's worried about me posting this because if he's on Reddit he might See it and hurt him.

Any advice? I don't know if he can be reported or if doing so he can talk his way out of it. Or we have to just wait until he gets so crazy that he does something and then respond. 

My buddy has tried ignoring him and not responding, not making eye contact but it has been getting worse, so he's been trying to be super friendly and happy and cheerful around him so he'd like him so if he snaps then he'll be safer.

There's supposed to be a camping trip with all the employees in the woods next week and he's scared this guy might freak out and hurt someone.

I have several nightmares a night and wake up every time. I also had some hypnogogic hallucinations and when I forced myself to the climbing gym yesterday I felt like everyone was staring at me. I notice 777 everywhere but I tell myself that it's just selective perception and it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what to make of it. In a way I don't feel psychotic because I'm not delusional I think, I keep myself away from everything occult and tell myself its not real. I try to stay grounded, but I'm scared.

1638,10v79bb,So how do I solve this?,"Second post
So basically parents divorced mom has schizophrenia and I stayed with dad for years and tried to ignore my problems.
My mother has a job and usually can do as she's supposed with just a few minor hallucinations at home.She is usually supported my grandma and her brother and has bren supported by them for years.
She really can't stand being without me so after she nearly lost her job because she didn't think there was any point working if I'm not with her I decided I need to take matters into my own hands.
I'm 16 years old and just entered high school.To be with my mother to try and help her I enrolled in a high school near where my mother stays.My dad accepted my decision and is not pushy with how I live my life as long as I study.
***********************
As you know there are two ways of dealing with the problems in your life:
1.You hate it so you sit and whine about it.
2.You hate it so you change it.
My mother has a major case of the first one made worse by schizophrenia.
My mother is very arrogant and ungrateful{towards my grandmother and maternal uncle(her brother)} as well which makes this even worse.She has many bad habits she refuses to change probably due to hallucinations.She justifies this by saying she does or does not do this.
1.She refuses to speak or listen to my grandmother considering her advice as worthless.She justifies this by saying that she doesn't talk to her at night.When I asked her why she replies by calling grandma garbage noise(she has a fascination witb the english language despite being bad at it).
2.Her arrogance prevents her from seeing her own faults.There was a time where she stated(desperately like shes trying to convince herself) that she's a working adult and thus isn't a burden to anyone while calling grandma a burden since she's old even though my grandma still does a lot of housework even at her old age.
3.Her arrogance leads her to ignoring other people's advice.For example there was a time where she said that grandma has no right to advice her as grandma doesn't have much of an education.
4.She refuses to acknowledge that many of the problems she's dealing with is her fault usually forgetting about it.
5.She usually thinks the reason her life is this bad is because she's unlucky and never thibks about improving it.She was never a very good thinker resulting in the issues that resulted in her mental problems worsening.Now however she doesn't seem to think at all.
She had these problems even before her mentall illness but it worsened significantly after her illness.
So how do I make her confront problems.It would normally be hard enough helping a bormal problem with this let alone someone with schizophrenia
The most important thing is trying to get her to actually listen instead of the I need to rest,silenceofr half hearted response she usually gives.",0,1
1639,10t6o1p,Some peace and quiet,"All Quiet on the Western front was a good movie and I definitely feel many younger women see guys who chose to fight for their futures with that level of determination very desirable. Interwar romance literature is all the rage with my alma mater Duke lately. I am in agreement with this. Tomorrow I might go watch the BTS recorded concert in theaters and next week I have a writing retreat. It gets a bit mundane lately and I wish I could jog and eat healthier and help my mom more. I like their song Yet to Come, about good things to happen in the future. Idk… I’m honestly just here to complain but I will share some thoughts on the movie.

It moved me the first day at war where the main character saw a flash of gunpowder light in the night. It is a recurring theme in many books from this era and probably represents destiny, the same destiny that brings unwitting people together, brings faith as quickly as takes it away, a light only visible to those who believe, not only belief in love or ambition, but possibility. I have a guy I like as well and to be honest I feel critical with some aspects of the modern era that has lost ethical integrity. People die, people are carted to the the hospital, dropping to the floor like pennies… and it has been termed as progress. I feel that we can win because the light exists, far off from a different galaxy and shines for only moments, gazed upon by the few and the brave. I believe that love is true and justice real, and all will not be lost to ambition and greed.",0,1

-(open eyed) visuals such at objects and distortions in shape and colour of objects
-possibly auditory hallucinations, most often someone consistently walking around my house at night or someone calling my name 
-belief of surveillance and sometimes an extreme untrusting of people around me especially friends and family
-certain off habits like checking behind doors (especially those sliding shower doors) 
-this tactile feeling of something like a hand being placed on my legs
-extremely realistic hallucinations of people when I wake up in the middle of the night)
-certain beliefs which I honestly don’t remember due to it only coming from other people and not from myself

my whole life crashed and i started crying everyday when i wake up because i have so much fear for everything…i also have depression since then and im always very agitated and crying all day over the same things…every person looks evil now for me and i am completely isolated….i just have my girlfriend and im feeling like paralyzed saying all day : its over, i cant any longer, its so heavy, help help help….i cant concentrate any longer and i feel like the world is living without me…really numb and have a bad headache…i cant describe it…it feels like my eyes are paralyzed…and when i go to supermarket it is hell for me….im just heavy anxious, jittery and think all persons are evil…i want to cry in the supermarkt.

What are you think about that? i thought i have just a major depression…but this is another level :( im also suicidal because i cant take this pain :( 

When i take a ativan, the heavy anxiety leaves and im able to talk. but there is still this feeling like world is not real and the depression symptoms still there. but the crying and the permanently repeating of how bad everything is stops.

what do you think :( ?",0,1

1673,vub77w,How do I get my schizophrenic brother help?,"This is my family’s cry for help. In 2018, my younger brother began heavily abusing psychoactive drugs. This subsequently lead to psychosis and a psychotic break where he attempted to murder our father and myself with a knife. He had stabbed our father in the neck and then came after me. Fortunately, I was able to escape and call the police, and our dad survived the attack. Since my brother was a minor, he was forced into treatment, and my dad dropped all charges. Since this first episode, my brother has been in and out of treatment facilities, but we no longer feel that we can take care of him and have no outlet to get him long term care.

While institutionalized for two months in 2019, my brother was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (schizophrenia with OCD tendencies). When he was released, he was relatively stable and succeeded in completing high school. At some point in 2020, he began reusing psychoactive drugs which led to another hospitalization in 2021 due to suicidal idealization. He agreed to go to a group home where he lived for two months. Again, he was released since he appeared stable and was not using drugs. Though, he began using drugs again immediately following this second release.

Just a few weeks ago, my dad, my brother, and I travelled to Anchorage, Alaska. Shortly after getting to my grandfather’s land up there, my brother suffered another psychotic break where he threatened to kill us and began gouging out his own eyes. We called the police and he was hospitalized for a week. We brought him back to Minnesota at the end of the trip, but it has been a daily struggle since. Immediately after getting off the plane, again, we had to call the police due to his violent threats and bizarre behavior. Though, Minnesota police refused to take him in since they deemed he was not a threat to himself or others. 

We do not know what to do. My brother’s delusions and hallucinations are intense. He is constantly speaking/laughing to himself as if there are multiple people in his head. His personalities change on a dime. One minute he appears normal, the next minute he is planning to kill you or someone else. When you alert the authorities, his demeanor completely changes and he then cross accuses you of horrible things to the police.

The police have been zero help unless he hurts himself or others. We have called the police on him nearly a dozen times at various points in the past 4 years. They only help if he is a threat to himself or others. This is an increased issue as he’s over 18 years old now. We cannot force him to be taken into custody for treatment. Our experience is a prime example of the failure of the mental health system to get people help. What hurts is that my brother distrusts us and hates us for calling the police when he has these psychotic breaks, and it appears these encounters only exaggerate his symptoms. Though we have no other choice when he is literally threatening to kill us.

One might ask “Why do you let him do drugs?”. He believes that they help him. He is high on marijuana 24/7. He spends over $100 a week on nicotine/CBD vapes, and he regularly abuses alcohol underage. If you get rid of any of these substance, he will go into an intense rage, again threatening to kill you. We feel there is no other choice but to let him do them.

His delusions are intense. He believes I am the “false prophet”, our dad is the “anti christ”, and our grandpa is the “the father”. He believes we stole his life and sold his soul to the devil. He is hardly in any sort of reality, and he does not believe he has an illness. Thus, getting him to take his medicine or cooperate in any way is difficult. He refuses in-person psychiatric meetings, and will only do phone calls. Again, his demeanor completely changes on these calls as he convinces his doctor that he’s fine even though he is far from fine. 

We have contemplated what the future holds, and each option seems horrific. We can 1) let things go the way they are and risk potentially becoming victims to his psychotic breaks or letting him hurt himself. We can 2) kick him out of the house and risk that he hurts somebody else or himself or end up in jail. Neither option seems favorable, and we don’t know what to do. 

As a 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force having graduated from the Academy, I believe there are few things which scare me, but I still refuse to sleep in the same house as my brother. We have to watch our backs at all times, prepared to run if he attacks. It is no quality of life living with him. He is a loose cannon with the potential for anything. With the news from Chicago this past 4th of July, I am unsurprised mass shootings occur. There are young men and women who need mental health help, but there is no way to get them help unless they hurt someone, themselves, or choose to seek help. It seems there is a significant flaw in the system, and I don’t want to be a victim of it. 

I do truly love my brother, and it pains me to know all of the life events he has already missed do to his illness. He has no job, no education, no friends, and he’s driven most of his family away. I want to help him. I want to trust him. I just don’t know how.",0,1
1674,vrtzrb,Schizophrenia Rehabilitation: The Road to Recovery,"One of the more severe mental illnesses, schizophrenia causes the person affected to experience great distress and dysfunction. It has a variety of symptoms that manifest in varying degrees of severity. Depending on how they impact functioning, the symptoms of the condition can be divided into positive and negative symptoms. Abnormal behavior is a manifestation of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms, on the other hand, are deviations from usual behavioral patterns.

**Treatment for Schizophrenia Symptoms: The Role of Schizophrenia medication, psychotherapy and more.**

The symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and thinking, social withdrawal, emotional flattening, and much more. The treatment approach for this begins with Medication. Schizophrenia medication plays a major role in the reduction of the positive symptoms of the disorder. 

The patient can only start comprehending their own disease once these treatments have started to demonstrate their efficacy. Then therapy enters the scene. The distinct psychosis module in CBT aids in improving understanding of symptoms and aids in modifying responses to symptoms.

The goals of psychotherapy are to increase functioning and lessen disability. A thorough treatment strategy that aids in a person's return to functioning includes group therapy, family therapy, and other forms of therapy.

**Schizophrenia Treatment Centers: Why Rehabilitation is the best option.**

Rehabilitation provides all-inclusive residential care. This removes the person from the rigors of everyday life and places them in a situation where their sole duty is to focus on their rehabilitation. Additionally, it gives the families a break. Knowing that their loved ones are receiving thorough care from qualified professionals allows them to sleep better.

Rehab facilities are created to facilitate a person's recovery. It enables the expert to create a structured treatment plan that the patient can adhere to. In the course of their everyday activities at the rehabilitation facility, this therapy pathway is reinforced. A rehabilitation facility also aids those with schizophrenia in overcoming the majority of difficulties brought on by the condition.",0,1

So over the past week my family and Is lives have been changed a lot. My little brother (18m) began acting strange after he broke up with his girlfriend. He began saying stuff like he was ""evil"" ""just like my father"", and that he needs to ""find God"". He first seemed normal but later we found out one night before he completely went over the rails. That he had went over to her house got in somehow and was shaking her out her sleep asking for forgiveness. The next day he had woken up and went to my dads house and was over there talking in circles and walking back and forth. He eventually went outside and took his shirt off and started trying to grab his ex gf because my mom had gotten her for some reason. And he started trying to grab my mom I had to get a hold of him and stop him from doing anything worse than I know he wants to do. We also had the police there as well and he went to their car and was opening and closing the doors after being told not to. After that we decided he needs to go to the hospital and he was screaming ab going to jail out the back of my moms car. He also grabbed her by the neck and doesn't remember doing it. When he was in the hospital and they tried to put the ekg straps on him he refused and was fighting back. They had to call security to hold him down so he could be sedated to go to sleep. When I saw him the next morning it was the same stuff as  the day before. He seemed to be able to respond a little better but would still snap back into delusion and not speaking right and all. Stupidly my father who now knows he was wrong tried to take him back home yesterday. All hell broke loose then, he was asking if I was my dad and if I was dead. My dad was still trying to talk to him normally due to shock and denial presumably. And during the night when he wouldn't go to sleep he jumped my dad and beat him up, dove out of a window, and ran down the street screaming he was God and they had to call an ambulance and police because he was unhinged now. Complete opposite of my little brother growing up. Now he's in the hospital and we're all assuming the worst. I had to post this because I need advice from anybody on what we can do to help him once he comes back home, and how to help get everybody's including my own mind off of this. It all happened so fast I remember him having digestion and bowel changes  about a month ago I told him to go to the doctor but we thought nothing of it. He'd been acting strange a couple days before him and his Gf broke up. Calling and saying he needs to confess sins and apologizing but not like he was the past couple days. I don't know what to do anybody else who's going through this or has been through please give me advice. I want my little brother back",0,1

October/16/2021
—————————-

Me: “When you come back ( after a hiatus so so speak ) it feels as though you’ve been gone a long time”

————-

He/She: “Your brother thinks I’m teaching him.  This still isn’t mundane enough yet”

Me:  “This is something I probably won’t understand until I pass”

He/She:   “Oh Chris..”

Me:  “Is it because I shouldn’t remember?”

———————

He/She:  “Chris, whatever happens i’am always here for you” - “we’ll let him have that one”

Me: “This shouldn’t feel normal”. - But it did, and still does to this point 

He/She: “When your ready to come here, you just know”

———————-

During the first year or so of this experience, they would follow a positive phrase with a negative one, or vice versa

 “This was while I was achieving semblance of order”

——————————

Me:  “Some of the words you share with me I instantly forget”.

He/She:  “I know kid”

—————

Me:  “What’s wrong with knowing?”

Me: “What’s wrong with telling?”

Same thing if i watch a movie.  1 movie in a day and after that i am mentally exhausted and i have to take it easy the next 2 days.

I dont care if adderall is addicting its better than being where i am.  Before this all happend, i got a 2 year degree from a college and was a senior in a University and its not possible no more.  

Ive been taking a over the counter nootropic called zenium i bought from amazon and it worked for a month and now it feels like its not working anymore.

Please dont say to meditate or exercise becasue ive already tried it.  I cant even exercise because there some kind of mental chemical in my brain that wont give me the energy to excersie.  I did weights for about a month and i stopped cuz i couldnt handle the stress no more.

1691,u8ps68,is this schizophrenia?,"I’ve had therapists in the past misdiagnose me multiple times so before I bring this up to a professional I’d like to hear from people who actually have it. I should probably also mention that my mom has schizophrenia and she raised me for my first 19 years. I’ve been diagnosed with bpd, adhd, depression, and anxiety though lately it feels as if there’s something bigger happening. I’ve heard noises before but not voices per say. Mostly I experience paranoia all day long. I’m scared normal people are going to hurt me. I’m scared my boyfriend is cheating on me even though if I asked he would show me his phone right away. I’m confused about my identity. It feels like I’m hanging on to reality by a thread sometimes, my emotional reactions just seem so misplaced and even if I’m aware of that it’s very hard to stop reacting once I’ve started. Sometimes it feels like life and death, I’m constantly fighting this war in my head between how I really feel and what I really want Vs this other “thought” telling me that I’m completely wrong. But it’s almost my own voice!! just more controlling and it’s very confusing. Sometimes I fall for it and make horrendously impulsive and damaging decisions. I’ll be sitting there confused afterwards wondering why I did that and it’s always followed by that other “thought” saying “because that’s how it should be”. It’s taking EVERYTHING in me not break up with my amazing boyfriend, or to stop talking to my incredibly supportive friends. It’s like that other “thought” is wired for self sabotage at all costs. I’m exhausted. I feel like I can’t win. I just want to be myself and for things to be quiet in my head. It’s constantly flooded with delusions about people and life and myself. All day long my brain ticks between delusions, then me trying to rationalize my way out of it, then the delusion fighting me. Today I had a panic attack that nearly took me out because I missed the bus which somehow meant my life was derailing. AND I CANT STOP checking for signs and angel numbers and certain times on the clock to validate if I’m on the right track or not. Like if I don’t leave the house at 1:27 then I’m not doing it right. Everything has to be done by “divine timing” and it’s like no this is a crazy way to experience control issues and you’re delusional. I’m even typing extra fast right now to post this by 10:57. This isn’t even the half of it though. Every single decision/thought I have is weighed with all this immense pressure, even deciding if I should brush my teeth or shower first. Sometimes I do neither and I go get the mail instead only to realize 3 hours went by and I didn’t notice. I want to be here. It’s so hard to keep myself here. I want to stop isolating myself and thinking that people are out to get me. I want to be comfortable around people but it feels like they don’t understand me when i talk. I feel put of place. I want to be able to rest. When I lay down I shake with the anxiety that my time is not being better spent and that my dreams will not come true now even though my eyes are closing on their own. I want to stop thinking my boyfriend doesn’t love me. I feel like Im suffocating in my own head.

I've been feeling depressed since September, and started feeling disconnected from reality around a week or two ago. I would look around, and everything felt fuzzy and clay-like. Like it was synthetic. 

Then, I started having a weird feeling of my brain being ""loud"". Not in a noisy way, but like a monster was trying to escape my head. Whenever this happened, I would grab my head and groan. Sometimes I would hit myself on the head (not too hard). I would also flex my arm muscles and ball up my fists.

Then, I started having random, short panic attacks. I got out of the shower, looked at myself in the mirror, and started to literally question if I was in the wrong body and someone stole my original body. Then I began to ponder if my soul was stolen and replaced also. That's when the panic really set in. And almost in an instant, it all stopped. I regained my clarity and wondered, ""why the hell did I think that?""

1703,q8lwes,I saw a video earlier of a guy explaining what it's like to have schizophrenia and it has set off alarm bells. I have a few questions from past experience.,"Please pardon my ignorance, but is this something you can grow out of or have stopped by other means?

As a kid I would hear pops and whizzes and a whole range of what I would describe as cartoon noises all the time. It was like listening to Loony Toons sound effects on an infinite loop. I remember my parents telling me, un-ironically and dismissively, that 'it's all in my head' and to just ignore it. So, I never got help or a diagnosis of any sort. It made it impossible to sleep in particular as at night it was so loud in my head. I also would zone out and didn't talk until 5, and I think it has a lot to do with the noise. 

However, in my case, at age 10, I was in a extremely bad accident reviving a massive brain injury that left me hospitalised in coma for several weeks (temporal lobe and back left side of head). When I left the hospital, first thing I noticed was the noises stopped. I have other issues now such as severe memory loss(can't remember names) and telling the amount of time when an event has passed (an event last year I might say was the other week, or something from last week I will say happened years ago), but the sounds have completely stopped. 

Never really occurred to me until seeing [the video](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/q7y9e3/simulation_of_auditory_hallucinations_caused_by/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that it could be anything other than a hyperactive mind, but I would be very interested in your knowledged opinions.",0,1

1714,pdrxwa,I think I might currently have (and have had for quite some time) residual schizophrenia.,"Although I could be totally wrong so feel free to disagree, I'm actually looking for people TO disagree with me because I think schizophrenia is quite a severe mental illness and it would be sort of scary to know I have it. I think the people who have it and live with it are amazingly strong, just to throw that out there. Also sorry for the long post, kind of ramble-y but I need  to get it out.

When I was around 12 I was given a ""pending"" diagnosis or whatever of potentially having schizophrenia (they also thought I might have disassociate identity disorder, or maybe merely just social phobia, etc)

I myself (and probably my counselors as well although they never said so much out loud) came to the conclusion that I basically had a version of Munchausen where you make up psychiatric rather than medical conditions in order to get attention, and that I also had SEVERE anxiety but had been raised in such a way that my mother didn't really attend to my needs in this regard (because she has unresolved issues with severe anxiety herself) (my father passed away several years ago). 

When I was around the age of 12 I created a very intense fantasy life, which was sort of like having an imaginary friend but I envisioned him so intensely and wanted to believe in him so intensely that I made him real. I have been VERY socially isolated my entire life and am VERY anxious of people and have almost no proper social interaction. And I was also really into movies and literature strongly featuring mentally ill people and I partially developed somewhat romantic notions of what those illnesses would actually be like and this INFLUENCED the relationship with my imaginary friend and the way I interacted with him and a bit of the character I gave him, but did not originate this relationship with intense fantasy life. 

I got over that but not my social anxiety, and my severe social anxiety combined with social isolation lead to a severe, persistent depression which developed it's own symptoms. The imagination part went away and my focus shifted to my relationships with other people as I inevitably had to start going into the work place and socially matured a bit.

I have become severely political, partly because I have utilized fellow mentally ill people as news sources online because I inherently trust their approach and levels of suspicions although until recently I did not suspect that they were mentally ill and I think they've twisted my head around a bit. I'm just really angry, fearful, insecure, painfully shy but to a level which makes me wonder if I am in the midst of some form of psychosis. 

Like I truly believe people are out to get me, that the world is falling apart, that my country is basically in a crisis takeover situation, that we're currently in a war but are so ENTRENCHED in this war that that our officials are too scared to announce it's happening or officially strike back because we are losing and it's more like a ""gentleman's"" agreement (influenced by large sums of bribery)  and that's the only thing keeping it from getting physical yet. (I live in Canada by the way)  My hands have actually developed some sores and scars and a few blisters but I just realized that it's the result of constantly wringing them together with a lot of force.

I've also become really fascinated with mathematics and genuinely and totally believe it's the language of the universe. Like to the degree that I think equations are humanity's way of describing gods (or maybe god, can't tell if it's multiple gods or just one god reflecting and projecting itself in different ways). And I was just thinking like.....this is kind of weird. I've never heard of this belief before and I always thought previously that's because most people are dumb but just recently thought what if it's because I'm psychotic?

I also really really struggle with maintaining basic self care and pay such little attention to appearance that it's kind of obvious SOMETHING is wrong with me.

I have been prescribed very real antipsychotic drugs and wonder if even if I didn't have genuine psychosis or genuine schizophrenia in my childhood and actually had Munchausen I was somehow able to ""act"" well enough that I convinced doctors to medicate me just in case, because they viewed the negative potential side effects of the medication being less harm than them happening to be right on the hunch that something like schizophrenia may actually be causing it and cause more harm in not treating it.  And maybe these medications kind of damaged my brain and have led me to develop some kind of persistent psychotic disorder (and I don't have enough education to know what else that may be other than schizophrenia). 

The other option is that I DID actually have it when I was younger, and WAS successfully medicated but now because I have such high functionality (getting good marks in school, being able to work albeit highly sporadically) the professionals I come into contact with don't really take me seriously and label me as having severe social anxiety and depression and an unspecified personality disorder, that while crippling and difficult to deal with doesn't warrant the diagnoses of residual schizophrenia? 

I recently just took like a 13 page questionnaire to determine what my diagnosis is and the doctor administrating it didn't diagnose me with residual schizophrenia, so it's very unlikely or impossible that I have it right? I was diagnosed with persistent depression, undifferentiated anxiety disorder, and an unspecific personality disorder with episodes of micro-psychosis. 

I'm just wondering if because I don't really see any professional for long periods of time and am always either switching or moving or something maybe they don't know me well enough and haven't developed enough of a rapport to see that I'm currently experiencing psychosis.

&#x200B;

Anyway if anyone read all of that I will be amazed, hopefully by describing my life/what I experience you could know right away without having to read the whole thing.

1715,p3bgrf,Temporary Schizophrenia?,"Is temporary Schizophrenia a thing? I ask because looking back at my childhood, I’ve had experiences that sound an awful like schizophrenia but I don’t have them now as an adult. (I’m 36)

When I was a kid (around 7 or 8 till around 10 or 11) I would get really bad headaches. When they’d get really bad I would hear things that at first sounded like white noise but would eventually start sounding like a bunch of people talking at once, like I was in a crowded room. I couldn’t understand what the voices were saying. It was just gibberish. I told my mom about it but she just insisted it was nothing. Eventually she thought maybe I was having headaches because of poor eyesight but a trip to the ophthalmologist ruled that out. Eventually the headaches went away. 

Also, I could remember one time I heard a voice call out my name before bed but no one in the house said they had called me. 

Another time I was in bed before falling asleep and I saw a figure walk into my room. Again, no one in the house claimed to have come into my room. 

My catholic upbringing explained the voice calling my name and the figure coming into my room as beings ghosts, but now that I’m older and don’t believe in such things, I wonder what it could have been. 

While I’m not aware of schizophrenia running in my family, my dad suffers from a series of mental illnesses such as OCD, ADD, and bipolar disorder. He may suffer from more but I’m not aware. Alzheimer’s and dementia also run in my family and I’m almost positive I have ADD and some mild form of OCD and possibly bipolar disorder but it’s not severe enough to totally derail my life.

1723,myug89,Is it possible to have mild forms of schizophrenia?,"So ever since I was a kid I’ve had visual and auditory hallucinations.

My first one happened when I was 6, I was laying in my bed when I saw an eye come out of the ceiling and I heard this female voice say my name.

Once I woke up and there were jellyfish all over my bed, I fucking hate jellyfish

But literally 10 minutes ago I saw a man walk through a tree and disappear from my window making me finally enquire about this.

Although this seems like I straight up have it, these are pretty far apart and rarely happen, I don’t have a voice and I don’t have characters that my mind creates, it’s all very random.

I should probably say auditory hallucinations happen way more often, could be hearing birds tweet above my head when I’m inside, or my door slam up stairs, among other things.

I would go to the doctors about it but if I’m officially diagnosed, it’s not a very good thing to have on your cv lol.

1724,mybsou,Can anyone relate? I tried going to a professional and didn't get diagnosed as I have no negative symptoms,"As the title says, I went to my local GP (I’m British) and spoke to them about the possibility of having schizophrenia, this was back in November. I was honest and I definitely felt like they couldn’t understand what I was saying at all. I was mainly aiming to get a diagnosis just so I wouldn't be  sensationalist about having it. So as it stands I have no diagnosis of anything.

My circumstances of how I ended up here seem different to most, I’ve had a lot of trauma in my life and back in 2015 I became an alcoholic because of a bad relationship. Looking back I’d say I was trying to suppress my intuition. During this time I used to be an avid Twitch user and befriended an individual that was clearly a ‘catfish’ (stealing other people’s photos and pretending it was them/their life), I didn’t care at first because they didn’t want anything and offered support. Over time curiosity got the best of me and so I google searched all their images and found some people whose pictures were being stolen. I reached out to them and ended up chatting with them about things. They called out/exposed the catfish and were pretty relaxed about the whole situation so I asked them why they were so chill. They spoke to me about near death experiences and that they could talk with the dead. Which yeah as someone who wasn’t that spiritual but believed in something asked how they do it. I was told you can learn to channel it and not believing that, I looked up on it and tried using a spiritual board to contact my ‘spirit guide’ while pretty much black out drunk. 

All I could say is that something happened, I can’t remember that well because I was intoxicated, but I felt something like a force, which back then I would have said was external but now I know it came from within. It moved my hand, communicated with me and since that night I can’t ignore it. At first as you can imagine I absolutely lost my shit, I was already drinking a lot so was relatively unstable and this happened back in September 2016 so it has been 4.5 years since.

In all the time since, the conclusion I’ve landed on is that ‘it’ the voice, the hallucinations are all a bi product of my subconscious trying to communicate with me in the only way it knew how. I just didn’t want to listen. I thought I was right and I knew best, but I didn’t, I was living a lie and didn’t know it. Realizing you are living a lie or what you believed to be true is incredibly difficult and I can see why most people avoid that pain. Not only is it hard accepting certain things about your past but to also go out and find the knowledge/search for the truth makes realizing you are living a lie even more difficult. 

Over the years I’ve realised I absolutely cannot control the voice, I can only condition it with my actions and thoughts. It knows everything I know, I can’t lie to it, I can’t deceive it. I personally consider it the truest version of myself and I’m still improving, if it's being toxic, I see that as a self reflection of me being unhappy. What I think of myself is what I think of myself, what it knows, is what I actually am. And no amount of arguing would ever change that, no amount of running away, no amount of alcohol or drugs would ever change this. I had to change it by facing it and accepting its truths. These  truths change as you learn more/become better.  

Two examples I wrote from a while back which helped me

‘From what I've noticed in people, is that people who are very giving/selfless can get sucked into the mindset that if you're a giving person, that makes you a good person and that's a psychological trap. If an individual is self sacrificing their own happiness for other people, they're not a good person, they're a push over. That doesn't mean giving is bad, however if you have trouble with self love/giving to yourself, then you shouldn't be self sacrificing your own happiness. This can in turn get worse if you also have trouble receiving love from other people, as a result of no self love, because then what happens is you'll notice people giving away all their love, have an inability to replace that love and then can't receive any love from others (cause of paranoia or whatever) just start to become hollow/have the life sucked out of them. If you add in things like having an abusive relationship (which in most cases people end up in because they're pushovers to begin with), then the feeling of being hollow is even more extreme and harder to overcome. A metaphorical way to view it is like, if you have a 'cup' of love, you can go around pouring liquid love into everyones cup, but if you can't refill that cup or let others fill it, it'll run dry and be empty inside. I'm a big believer in happiness doesn't have to be sacrificed to be shared, sharing it properly creates more in my experience.’ 

With this one, I had to start putting myself first, learning to love myself. Years ago if I said I loved myself I’d feel bad, the voice wouldn’t like it. Now I’m so much more comfortable saying it, I still don’t absolutely love myself but I’m getting there. Also learning to stop helping other people when they can’t help themselves was key too.

‘I wanna talk about self-deprecatory humour and how I think it's bad for people, it was somewhat touched upon earlier, how people seem to use it as a defense mechanism and I get that. The way I see it though, is if you're making self-deprecatory jokes I feel like you’re projecting onto the world that it's okay to take you as a joke. Like how people say ‘I should be a comedian because my life is a joke’, it just feels like people are reinforcing that they shouldn’t be taken seriously and it removes guilt. Or if you’re really funny you can get instant gratisfaction for making people laugh and people like a funny person. I could be wrong but I’m sure I read a small article about how self-deprecatory humour is only good when you can’t change your circumstances, because it's like why would you make a joke about something you can change? And jokes are a good way of dealing with things you can’t change because that's why the saying ‘if I wasn’t laughing I’d be crying’ exists right?’

This one's self explanatory. So once I became aware of the voice being my subconscious (I just call it that), I had to learn to be careful of what I say and think, and now it's gotten to the point I don’t use self deprecatory humour, if I did make a joke out loud, the voice would be like hey wtf you’re not allowed to do that. Because I conditioned it over years and was vigilant. 

One serious issue I had is, I’m naturally quite philosophical and always believed in something but I couldn’t tell you what, until now. Whatever I believe in gives my subconscious the power to use it as a way to communicate with me and I came to the conclusion that life is a paradox. We know we exist, we can use science to measure why we exist all the way up until the big bang and then it's like ‘we don’t know why it happened’. Which is a paradox, we have a creation but don’t know who made it. At this point in time, you can believe whatever you want. 

You believe in angels, demons? Yeah go for it, I don’t any more. I don’t follow anyone elses god, religion, deity or divine watchmaker and I exist so I know I should believe in something. The thing that freed me most was realizing I can believe whatever I want but it has to be consistent, because how I act is in essence a reflection of what I truly believe. This is also important to me because if you believe in certain things, you are essentially giving away your power for free will. And if I say now I believed in only bad things, like I know some people get told they were created to suffer and so if you can only believe you were created to suffer, wouldn’t it make sense that your subconscious would act that way? Because you believe it? 

I’ve also had these ideas reinforced because while I’m not diagnosed, I’ve reached out to many people and spoken to them about them. A good example is, has anyone seen the TedTalk by Dr Eleanor Longden (a sufferer of schizophrenia) where she talks about ‘the voices representing suppressed emotions’? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjEN3peCJw&ab\_channel=TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjEN3peCJw&ab_channel=TED)

I was shown this video after I came to the same conclusion, while I haven’t spoken to Eleanor herself, I have spoken with people in her department as they’re British.

Sorry if this is so long and maybe jumbled up. I tried to keep it short as I could write a lot more. It's taken me years and years of self reflection, self learning and improvement to get where I am now and I still have plenty of work left to do. Sometimes self improvement is difficult and I just want you all to know I believe in you! Like I truly (with how I view life and what not) adore you all.

I’ll respond to all comments, I’m really not afraid of anything my brain can show me anymore, I’ve thankfully processed most of my pain/trauma and I can hopefully help some people face their own inner fears. 

If anyone wants to see more about me. I’ve noticed there are some gamers here so hopefully some people have heard of Healthygamer, where Dr Alok Kanojia (DrK) talks about their life/problems. I talk with him about my life and at about 80 minutes I bring up the spirit guide incident. I spent months around him behind the scenes too and he’s the one who told me you can get schizophrenia from just meditating (and I’d consider using a spirit/ouija board as meditation).

I was scared. 

and hurt by the constant negative attention.

I'm okay with attention but when you start personal attacks constantly like all day it really hurts I didn't know people didn't take meds used these pages I must have set him off somehow. I'm sorry I been called a stalker harraser but I was mostly just giving unwanted attention.

I'm okay with attention but persoanal attacks and put downs are heinous I'd never do that to anyone woman or man.

seems like I'm always victimized. But I've gotten clearer mind these past few days I understand I can't win against a person who is attacking me.

I should have blocked along time ago. 

that's the thing with me I have a good heart and very understanding

that's how I've gotten into trouble my heart is touched and very vulnerable. 

I think everyone is good but they are not.

but I do understand when I'm being attacked and it's not okay and actually i feel awkward in life. but I'd never constantly barrage someone with negative stuff. that's totally messed up.

I try my best not to give woman unwanted attention too. I never knew how harrasment felt usually i would cower.",0,1

Title of Research: Investigating Drug Use & Mental Health in People with a Family History of Psychotic Disorders

UAB IRB Protocol #: IRB-300006240

Principal Investigator: Haley Dourron, B.S.

Sponsor: UAB Department of Health Behavior

Have you ever used any drugs, including alcohol or cannabis? Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham are particularly interested in understanding more about the association between substance use and mental health in people with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders. We are also interested in understanding more about the impact of various substances on mental health in the general population as well. We would deeply appreciate it if you could take between 25 to 40 minutes to participate in our online anonymous survey-based study. The study varies in duration depending on your answers to questions about your drug use and your participation in a writing task section.

We do not collect identifying information such as your name, email address, or IP address. Questions include items related to basic demographics, drug use, psychiatric diagnoses, and mental health measures as well as opportunities to tell us more about a significant life experience in your own words.

To participate, you must be at least 18 years old and fluently read and write English. You are not required to have experience with illegal drugs or to have a family or personal history of psychotic disorders to participate. If you have any questions, please contact Haley Dourron ([hdourron@uab.edu](mailto:hdourron@uab.edu))

The reason I found out was because my older brother is a schizophrenic. Him and I went through a episode together and ever since that day I was never the same mentally. Schizophrenia runs in genetics, I have not gone to the doctors to get any medication. I had wicked thoughts, I had horrendous thoughts that weren’t me. Where I’m at now in life mentality i am prospering. I no longer have those thoughts in my head telling me to do things, I no longer have those thoughts telling me people are talking behind my back. I was terrified to walk out in public because I was convinced I saw my own death. I had this delusion that not a single person in this world cared for me, not even my own family. They would reassure me saying that they loved me, and the thoughts in my head told me differently. I don’t know about you guys but I have found the ultimate peace in my soul. The thing is it all started with one prayer, it took me about 5-6 months to finally obtain the peace where these thoughts were solved. Ever since my first prayer, I have noticed things change in my life for the better. This is my personal experience, this is what helped me. I put this out there so this may help you guys. I even had times when I would read from the Bible the thoughts in my head would tell me that it’s brainwashing me. It truthfully wasn’t, it was healing me. I was persistent in it and that is how my life changed. I really hope what I have posted really helps someone🙏🏼 I’m living my best life, and it’s all because of our Heavenly Father💛 if you guys have any questions about my story please feel free to ask me, I will answer all questions to the best of my extent. I have found out in my journey that mental illness is controlled by sin, that is why we have the wicked thoughts that we do. Sin is corrupt and that is why our minds become corrupt. The only one that is able to heal our mind from sin is our Heavenly Father and Jesus. That is how I am prospering the way I am mentally now. I thought to myself is this really my life? Am I really suppose to live like this? How can I get a job? How can I make bonds with people that don’t love me? THAT IS THE SIN TELLING US THESE THINGS. Ever since I have embarked on this journey with our savior he has shown me true happiness, he has brought nothing but joy to my heart💛 this is my story, I hope this allowed someone to break through. I don’t expect everyone to believe me, as long as I can help one soul that is all that I care about.",0,1

1745,k3vh8w,Psychosis during parenthood," 

Hi, my name is Nicole Dawson, I am currently completing a masters in clinical and health psychology at the University of Liverpool.

I am conducting a research project into the factors that can help or hinder recovery from psychosis in parents. This research is important as it values the opinions and experiences of the parents themselves as the service user is seen as the expert in their own recovery. Moreover, this research can be used to inform health professionals and clinical settings on how we can best support parents with psychosis on their recovery journey. This research has received ethical approval by The University Of Liverpool Ethics Committee.

As of the situation with COVID-19 all interviews will be carried out over the phone or using applications such as Zoom. All participants data will be kept anonymous and confidential. If you would like to take part the following eligibility criteria apply:

You must speak fluent English and be between 18-60 years old.

You must have experienced psychosis during parenthood, this may be or may not be include a formal diagnosis.

You must be in a period of recovery and have been recovered for at least 12 months. You MUST self-identify as currently being in a period of recovery, and have had no significant intervention or crisis intervention from mental health services for the 12-month period. This includes community treatment orders, and any period of hospitalisation for mental health care. This does not include routine medical appointments, such as medication reviews or clinics.

If you are interested in taking part in this research, please email - [n.dawson2@student.liverpool.ac.uk](mailto:n.dawson2@student.liverpool.ac.uk) or further details.

I talk to myself often and normally there is 3-4 of us in my head but it is all internal monologue and I know they arent real. Just me thinking or planning how to go about something.

So yeah I’m a teenager who was falsely diagnosed with psychosis 4-5 months ago at a psych ward. They did a couple psychological tests (PAI and Rorschach) as well as motor skills testing (Beery VMI, etc.)

The psychiatrist who diagnosed me called my beliefs of my parents murdering me, drugging me, etc. delusions for no reason.

Also, she used ”me being delusional” as a reason why I couldn’t leave from there and placed me on a hold (which ended up in my involuntary admission) She also said that I have ”impulsivity associated with being psychotic” (?? Never heard of anything like that) and that I was paranoid.

The nurses thought I was hallucinating because of my demeanor (i don’t understand why, I was acting like I usually am which is calm and chill)

When I refused my meds one day they just threatened me with injections and said that if I don’t take the meds I would become worse or something like that

Am I having a conversation in my head when I do this-
When I daydream about him,
And what he may be thinking or saying about me?
Is that why when I imagine what his words would be-
I almost hear a different voice in my thoughts?

I can feel his distant presence as I sit in my computer chair,
Doing my usual activity; playing a video game,
But he’s there…
I can feel his eyes on me as he watches me play,
I imagine him judging my bad posture,
Causing me to sit up straight to fix it.

Why do I do this when I know he isn’t actually there?
Why do I have moments where I find myself trying to impress him?
And for what-
Imagining what he thinks, what he would say, or even imagining a facial expression?
Am I desperate for attention and love from another that much?

Quite a sad situation but…
I can’t help but do it anyways,
It feels nice to think that someone truly cares,
Someone truly has interest in me,
Someone wants to protect me and learn more about me.

I feel his, or even their stares when I imagine more pairs of eyes at once,
Listening to music, I imagine their thoughts towards my tastes,
I imagine how they feel towards the lyrics, tempo, and more,
My mind concentrating on both the music-
And imagining these people; these things watching me from faraway.

I can feel his presence as I write this,
Judging and learning more and more as each line is written,
He knows I’m writing about him,
But he can’t do anything about it,
He’s just a figment of my imagination after all.

""Get back to your reality, Sam. He isn’t there because he doesn’t exist,"" I try to tell myself.

Why do I do this? I’ve been doing this for years with all of these different characters and people. Video game characters and youtubers I admire, all living in my imagination; the reality I wish was truly real.",0,1

So I would consider myself a normal person at this point.

But my mom has schizophrenia and as such, the thought that I'll get it one day is consuming my thoughts regularly, I'm 16 and my brain is convinced that one day I'll end up miserable like my mom, and the thought is insanely scary, I feel like if I think about getting it too much, I'll somehow get it through worrying

I can't get the thought of certain doom out of my head, that I'm screwed because of my increased risk due to my mom. I keep noticing things and panicking it may be a symptom of schizophrenia, for example, I see something in the corner of my eye quite regularly, like a shadow or a cockroach (we had a cockroach infestation till recently) and there's nothing there, when i realize that I convince myself I'm fucked, I have schizophrenia 

Likewise today I felt a bit paranoid talking to my grandma because my mom spend my entire childhood talking to me about how evil she was, I was able to rationalize those thoughts away but the fact that the paranoia even subconciously briefly entered my head scares me to no end and convinces me I have schizophrenia

The anxiety is just consuming me and I don't know what to do, I already have anxiety and hypochondria but the thought of losing control over my mind is a lot scarier than any physical illness, anytime schizophrenia is mentioned or I see it in any media I start panicking and fixating, I keep worrying I'll wake up one day and hear voices, what should I do?",0,1

1770,hbo5sm,PTSD or Schizophrenia?,"Hey! I've been going through some of the feed on this page and everyone seems super nice! I was just wondering what you guys think of my situation. 

So basically in summer of 2017 I had my first psychotic episode from smoking hella weed in which I began to become very paranoid and suspicious of my mates until that turned into becoming paranoid about what Facebook were using my information for. I was having some family problems and girl problems at the time as well which was contributing to my stress. 

Without knowing what was happening I decided to go to Bali to get my head together instead I found myself on top of a hotel building which I thought I was being led up there by some spiritual figure. I then essentially got sectioned abroad and woke up tied to a bed after being injected with sedatives. I then became extremely psychotic when I got home such as YouTube comments saying ""I'll kill you"" and then the notes on my phone had seemed to be changed to questioning reality which really tripped me out and I began attaching meaning to everything like messages from the universe. 

After I thought people on the streets were laughing at me and talking about me. I've had an obsession with eye perception as my social skills have considerably plummeted and now I have social anxiety and when I make eye contact I get really fearful. 

During this time I have tried to get over the trauma with drugs, alcohol, sex, being a gym freak, therapy and I've tried 7 different medications. At the moment I'm on venlafaxine, propranolol and risperidone. 

I no longer have any delusions about people talking about me but I still feel disconnected from reality. I have crippling anxiety and I'm constantly depressed. And it annoys me how my social skills have just vanished. 

I seem to have all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and this is getting all too much for me now to the point where I am feeling really suicidal and I fear for my future and career. My thoughts feels super anxious and I just feel really out of touch.

1775,gctzia,Self diagnosed schizo (waiting on referral from doctors),"Hey, this is my first post here and am looking for advice. 

So I had my first psychotic break a few months back and I’ve been struggling with it ever since, some weeks can be great where as some are quite bad.

The first episode was after taking some LSD at a party  which after a few hours resulted in me thinking that my friends were insulting me and trying to turn me insane, I eventually left and got a taxi home in which this continued with extreme paranoia and thinking they were somehow still insulting me through the radio 😂 I got home and after a few restless hours on the come down got some sleep and woke up the next day feeling very confused. I rang a friend to verify whether any of this was true and was told no, I was just sat there silent looking at everyone (this is where I was probably hearing the insults) 

Anyway a few days went by and I started to return to some state of normality, I still get some feelings of paranoia to do with other things but quickly dismiss them in my head and don’t believe any of the delusions. 

The situations I’m having now is that I am getting some tactile hallucinations like little insects on my legs at night as well as some visuals in my peripheral vision such as dark spots on walls and the occasional flash in the corner of my eye, it isn’t all day long it tends to happen when I’m not doing anything and not distracted. 

I can pretty much deal with this as it doesn’t bother me much but the thing that’s getting to me most is my speech, I’m struggling to have conversations. When I’m listening to people I have a huge build of anxiety because I don’t wanna fuck up and mistakes and as you can imagine this causes me to fuck up 😂  My words either come out wrong, I say them in the wrong order or it’s a blend between 2 words. What’s the best way to fix this? It’s really impacting me and stopping me from wanting to be social or have conversations in case it happens again. Last week I seemed to be getting better but it’s came back to haunt me again

So any advice Reddit? It’d be much appreciated 

Oh and last question, if I am fully diagnosed I feel like I’ll be a high functioning schizo, what’s the medication like? Would it fix my cluster of thoughts and speech?",0,1
1776,gcnjoo,I’m 16 and I think I might be developing schizophrenia (HELP),"I live in a really rural area, and I am a stoner and have to go kinda far (about a 7ish min walk) into the wilderness to smoke (can’t smoke weed in the house). Anyway it got dark and I was alone, out in the woods. I tried to relax myself with music but I kept hearing *things* and it made me extremely scared. I kinda felt shit too, like I was being watched and things were behind me. 

This wasn’t the first time something like this has happened, but it was the first time it got so vivid and I got so paranoid and scared. I keep hearing people calling my name, or at least I think I do. It’s usually when I’m alone, and it’s not a very clear voice, but in the back of my mind I interpret whatever I hear as ‘Gabriel’. 

I’ve had instances where I’m alone in the dark and I think something is following me, watching me, etc. 

Edit: One time I took acid and had kinda a bad trip where my hand looked like it was decaying, dying, becoming black. Today I had the same experience and started to wonder if the weed I just smoked was laced but that was impossible.

I still occasionally hear a stray voice in my thoughts but not as badly as it was when I was exhibiting symptoms. During the time I was admitted, I had envisioned ""myself"" chained in an cave somewhere and all these ""spirits"" making noise around me had nothing good to say. I had so many theories as to what was happening to me that I lost track and surrendered (at this time I didn't know what schizophrenia was). All I wanted was everything to go quiet. I fantasied about pure silence and really wished myself gone so as to silence the never-ending nightmare. When someone would speak. I couldn't hear them well and mostly what they said was drowned in the noises in my head. So I just remained there. Listening to the voices, doing nothing but hoping all would go away. I however noticed the demonic nature of this. Am calling it demonic for lack of better words because of how mean and out of nature everything was. One could easily assume they were possessed. The hallucinations were not pleasant either regardless of how vivid the day dreams were.  They however got worse when I tried doing something spiritual like praying. I didn't get a chance to visit any place holy except for a prayer room in the mall filled with Muslim prayers who tried to show me how to pray and recite ""Al Fatha"". I remember it being a bit relaxing when someone asked me to just do as they did while they prayed. After that, the invasive thoughts came back.

1784,f8bnje,"Paper on Thoughts, Mind's Eye and Prediction"," Everything \[ \] is for focus recognition and focus emphasis for the reader.

Descartes thought I think therefore I am. Reality and Consciousness may be an illusion. Eastern Philosophy indicates that consciousness is all around us. Consciousness is our recording of our reality, each moment is a snapshot of reality for the perceiver. We call these snapshots ""Now"" for they are instantaneous in the now.

I call thoughts and ideas, \[Knowal\]'s(Know Now Object/Origin Word/Wrap All Learned), Knowing a conscious observation of an object, it's origin, it's word and everything wrapped up with it all learned. I believe google tried something similar when they tried creating Knol, the supposed to be competitor to Wikipedia. Knowals are data signatures that we continuously update in our minds like advanced concepts such as mastering memory, approximation, generating imagination, frontal field of view, inside head view, back of mind view. All humans visualize stories quite well that I believe is a natural instinct for our own screencapture technology. A story is a Knowal also. From \[object recognition\] to \[object classification\], thoughts may be stored within \[words\], words build up with meaning and intent when used to store memory to each assigned word. Within that memory we store many other things such as objects visual image and strings of data such as text serving as data signatures. That storing of memory is a knowal. A knowal is a \[data signature\]/\[select focus idea\]/\[group of compiled thoughts\]. Knowals are thought constructs made up of data, every update to the knowal is a touch. Touching a knowal is to re-summarizing it.

Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) is a biological philosophy of mind that postulates that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons, rather than the conventional view that it is a product of connections between neurons. The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. Which have oscillating dipoles via quantum superposition. Consciousness is based on non-computable quantum processing performed by qubits formed collectively on cellular microtubules, a process significantly amplified in the neurons. The qubits are based on oscillating dipoles forming superposed resonance rings in helical pathways throughout lattices of microtubules. The brain thinks at 25msec at 40hz frequency of oscillations. Research suggests that there are roughly 49 thoughts per minute so around 70,000 thoughts per day.

\[The Life's Addition Theory\] The brain must eventually come to a conclusion that life is a series of adding things up. From one \[focus\] to another \[focus\], life is a series of added focuses. Look at your life as one straight line of addition of observations accumulating and forming into what we have as our conscious thoughts or our conclusions. Due to the nature of the brain, thoughts are quantum superpositioned into reality. With the shear amount of operations in our brain happening at once, objects get focused and refocused, ""out of focus"" objects get stored into \[Background Build\] of the Mind. Background Build collects, piles up and filters all data/focuses being taken, all at the same time keeping it hidden within the background of our mind. The conscious may pull objects/knowals from the background build to the surface such as reciting letters in your head internally out loud.

\[Subvocalization\] is reading with your mind's voice aloud internally in your head. When you recite the alphabet ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"" You can feel each letter in your mind/head with your \[minds voice\] if you practice reading and subvocalization. Each letter announced in your head is tangible, just like reading any word outloud in your head would be tangible. Placing a sphere with your imagination over this tangible subvocalization can be used as good practice into tapping into your ability to use your Mind's Eye. Since you know mentally where the letters arise in your mind, you can visualize a sphere with same positioning as where the letters are mentally conjured. The mind's eye can be used as ability to \[recall\], \[re-draw\] and \[re-vision\] it. \[\[Thoughts\] are how you \[perceive\] them to the conscious observer.\] So holding an imagination sphere with your mind's eye can be considered as a thought in itself. Your ability to hold the sphere with mental vision of it in focus is called your mental \[Focus Hold Strength\] which is determined by elapse time of visual seen.

Let's try and create a spinning thought or an imagination particle. From using your imagination, recite the alphabet in your head and imagine a perfect sphere ontop of the count of the alphabet. You should subvocalize the alphabet with your Mind's Voice outloud as you do this. For every letter counted the sphere spins 90 degrees forward. Put an arrow inside the sphere to give it depth and rotate that arrow 90 degrees every letter. Practice this a couple of times, see if you can really manifest a sphere ontop of the alphabet count. Just imagine a sphere over the letters being counted out in the alphabet, try to visualize it and let me know if you can do this. I think this is good practice for imagination because the reciting the alphabet is so tangible in the mind and feeling in the brain that it gives you a good grounds to imagine a sphere and place it over the letters. This is called using your minds eye. Once you get good enough at visualizing, the recall/pull of these visualizations again comes from your Background Build membrane wall that filters data and images for your conscious pool of thoughts.

Memory Association Addition Predictions

Everything \[ \] is for focus recognition and focus emphasis for the reader.

The brain has the ability to take various \[visual and mental focuses\] and compile it into a \[prediction\] of outcome. Finding a word's numerical value can help you make \[mathematical predictions\] based upon your ability to count, add and associate letters by number. By looking at the word, you can guestimate what's the word value. This is a form of \[prediction\]. The letters are associated with the number in your mind and are pinged based upon strength of memory association, imagination of number with corresponding letter, and the ability to take a bunch of numbers and instantaneously come up with a sum value which serves as a form of \[prediction\] within the mind. You can practice your mind's ability to \[associate and predict\] by associating the alphabet with numerical values starting 1-26.

Assigning number values 1-26 to the alphabet ""A1 B2 C3 D4 E5 F6 G7 H8 I9 J10 K11 L12 M13 N14 O15 P16 Q17 R18 S19 T20 U21 V22 W23 X24 Y25 Z26,"" will serve as a reference in calculating and help you predict word values. This will allow you to practice your memory association ability and the ability to strengthen association with while your brain takes in the letters and converts them to numbers, the brain takes the set group of numbers and both unknowingly and knowingly make a mathematical prediction of the total sum value of the word. Let's deduce a word's numerical value, like for example the word, ""word"" ""Word=W23+O15+R18+D4=60"" Now write down the words ""Lucid"" Racecar"" and ""Realm"" and guess what the word values are and now try and make a prediction of all three added up together, i'll give you a hint as a \[prediction window\] it's will be between 100-200 word value. \[Prediction Windows\] are giving the observer a guessing range to help direct the brain in an accurate direction for predicting word number values. What did you predict for all three and individually for each word? I'll assist you in the process.

Take the word ""Lucid=L12+U21+C3+I9+D4=\_\_\_"" and by brief glance form a prediction of the total sum of the word ""Lucid,"" do the same with ""Racecar=R18+A1+C3+E5+C3+A1+R18=\_your prediction\_"" and ""Realm=R\_+E\_+A\_+L\_+M\_=\_your prediction\_"" and figure out what all three words ""Lucid Racecar Realm"" are added together. Write down your predictions first, first your \[set of number addition prediction\] with Racecar and your \[memory association prediction with Realm.\] Now take ""Astral Master"" and figure out the total sum word value of that. (Here's some practice for your short term memory) Remember what the value of ""Word"" was? Now add ""String"" to ""Word"" and what value do you mathematically come up with? ""Word String"" Which is fitting for this paper, for it is just a bit of words stringed together and how the alphabet mnemonic may evolve to be better utilized furthering your ability with the mind's eye and solving word values for making mind's predictions

Use [https://www.dcode.fr/word-value](https://www.dcode.fr/word-value) as a tool or Word Sum App on Android, which you can get here at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.dumbsmartapps.w0rd5um&hl=en\_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.dumbsmartapps.w0rd5um&hl=en_US)

**Schizophrenia Treatment – Best Ones Listed**

Schizophrenia is one of the psychotic disorders or a psychological or a mental health condition in which a person loses contact with the reality in association with hallucinations and delusions being the more prominent symptoms.

It is usually reported in late adolescence or at the beginning of adulthood. It is a chronic disorder which accompanies an individual for the lifetime. So, if you know someone suffering from schizophrenia or you have a dear one struggling with this psychological condition, then surely you must be curious to know about its treatment procedure.

Here we have tried to provide you with detailed information for the **Treatment for Schizophrenia**.

**Schizophrenia Diagnosis**

https://preview.redd.it/en0sq3bgxtd31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5f228bec91902459063bd8c095d5541cf3cdc60b

&#x200B;

There are an official set of symptoms which a patient must show in order to get diagnosed as a schizophrenic. As per diagnostic guidelines, an individual should possess two out of the following symptoms for a period of at least 6 months duration:

* Hallucinations (false perceptions)
* Delusions (false and firm beliefs that are based on irrelevant backgrounds and are difficult to change)
* Poorly organized speech and thoughts
* Bizarre behaviour or hyperactivity
* Catatonia (poorly coordinated motor movements)

*Complete list of Symptoms coming soon*

One has to go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist for getting a diagnosis of schizophrenia and should discuss the noticeable changes. The doctor or the psychiatrist would evaluate psychologically as well as a proper medical examination is done. They will take more information regarding family history, recent behavior or any past medical or psychological illness, if present.

The doctors may perform CT scanning and MRI for ruling out the possibility of brain cancer or a tumour. They may also do a urine test or a blood test for ruling out the possibility of drug abuse.

A psychologist also performs various psychological tests for assessing cognition, personality and other projective tests such as *Rorschach test* which can dig deeper into the mind of the individual.

Early detection of schizophrenia and effective medications could make an individual better and enable an individual to lead a more stable life.

Let us know more about what type of medicines are recommended in schizophrenia.

**Medications**

https://preview.redd.it/k5hj5ctixtd31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca85530331ad2481fb21a2f06e84bfef5b1ae2c3

&#x200B;

For treating the psychotic symptoms that are present in schizophrenia, the psychiatrists recommend taking antipsychotics to provide relief from symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.

These medications target the neurotransmitters in the brain, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Both these chemicals play a very important role in causing schizophrenia according to medical model theory.

It might be possible that the psychiatrist would recommend taking medications for the lifetime to an affected individual despite any improvements in the patient just for preventing the chances of getting a relapse (*facing the symptoms again and again*)

Antipsychotics could be prescribed in any form –

* Oral
* Through Injection or
* Liquid form.

Those patients who do not show compliance with regular medications may consult their doctors.

In such cases, they are given long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI). This is a strong dose which is usually given for once or twice in a month and it acts

same

as that of the regular pill of antipsychotic.

Doctors usually select the medications depending on various factors such as its effect on the reduction of symptoms, the cost-effectiveness of the drug, potential side effects, the accessibility of medication, and the dosage of the drug.

Worried this could indicate schizophrenia in near future.,"I'll admit, my knowledge on schizophrenia and other mental illnesses mostly stem from what Google has so kindly provided me. This post is not intended to be a self-diagnosis, or looking for others to diagnosis me, but rather to relay my personal experience to others in hopes to find some answers so I can contact professional help if some of these signs point towards a possible mental disorder.

&#x200B;

For some background information about myself, I am a 20 year old female going to college who has previous experiences of high anxiety and depressive episodes. I was on Prozac for a few months, ranging from Sept. 2018 - Dec. 2018, but was taken off of it just because it made me feel less focused, which does not mix well with schooling. Currently, I am on no other medications.

&#x200B;

In late November my roomates and I scored some LSD, which I have never previously tried. The only drugs I used prior was the occasional weed every now and again. We each took a tab and a half and while coming up I felt pretty uplifted, everything felt more vibrant and full of life. During the peak of my trip, everything changed so dramatically. I started having intense hallucinations, I was sitting on my couch, the livingroom window behind me, and started seeing peoples faces pressed up against the glass of the window. I remember hearing some auditory hallucinations as well. I was around six people during my trip (which to be frank I don't even remember half of the shit that I actually did in reality like I was suffering from major dementia or something). According to my roommate I was completely unresponsive, I experienced  echolalia, I just kept repeating the same phrase over and over again and kept pacing around the livingroom telling everyone ""I just need a minute"". During this trip I was surrounded by anything but reality, but for brief moments I would experince break throughs back to reality where I could function to some extent before being fired back into the intense trip. Though I have read various stories about psychotic breaks during an intense trip, my biggest concern is now whenever I smoke weed (the occasional times I do it) I dive right back into that same weird mental breaks. The weirdest thing about this is I have no recollection of any of the possible episodes I may be having. The last time I smoked cannabis, which is going to be my last time, I would often fall into a stupor/zone state, not communicate with anyone, I kept excessively moving my body in weird positions quite frequently, and I would also have vocal outbusts where I would repeat a phrase someone has said, or mimic ""general actions"" like picking up my phone, setting it down, and picking it up again only to set it back down. I will often show no reponse to outside stimuli or will be very exagerated about my body movement, moving in a way that seems excessive like I have no control over my motor functions. It has been very hard because whenever I have these episodes I can hardly remember the things I have said, or done so it almost feels like it never happened. My roommates have never said anything, but I also feel compelled to ask them if I act peculiar on substances. I am so close to asking if they have noticed anything odd (seeing as I cannot remember more than half of the things I do) but I am also scared to find out the truth. Whenever not on drugs, I feel perfectly and complete sane, aside from the occassional depressive moments and anxiety I deal with, I'm just curious if this could be a possible warning sign of future schizophrenia, it does not run in my family as far as I am aware, but I can say that the symptoms I have been experiencing do trouble me, and I fear there could be some underlying reason for it.",0,1

Not that they’re talking out loud, like they’re speaking in their mind and I can hear them and we’re talking.  The anxiety that I’m battling is that everyone can hear what I think, And my “family” wants me to stop thinking because everyone can hear each other and I’m the only one who still thinks out loud. They’ve also told me to get into my mind, implying I got out of my mind. A friend told me I was never in my mind in this anxiety auditory world. I feel blind to something I can’t fix and nobody can help or understand, or that if I try to talk to people they dont understand or won’t tell me, as if it’s some great conspiracy

Edit: I also lack an internal voice or monologue. Not that I can’t speak in my mind, but I don’t have a consistent voice. Like it’s changing between high or low pitch. Leading me to believe that the voices I hear are simply my mind talking to itself in the different pitches and tones I can produce and that I’m unaware of my brains own activity",0,1

1811,ar6lgi,Could I have schizophrenia?,"There’s something very wrong going on my mind and I don’t seem to be able to explain it to my therapist or my ex psychiatrist. My ex psychiatrist gave me meds for months that did not change a single thing, only left me always tired and sleepy. He diagnosed me with anxiety and a little depression. But anyway, I’ll try to explain, maybe someone will identify too? Idk what else to do. I’m really scared to leave my house, or “safe” places, like my room, or even some objects like a teddy bear I have since I was born, btw I’m 21. And I’m not sad or anything, like, If I stay in my room I’ll make my day productive, I’ll do everything that has to be done and more, I just don’t wanna leave it?! It’s like, I’m terrified. And every time I do leave my house (which I have to do everyday) I feel like I’m having a mental confusion or something, I can’t focus on anything, I feel like I’m gonna get lost, or forget my name?! I don’t feel like I’m awake. And I cannot pay attention on class at all. So when I get home I have to learn everything “again”. Most of the times I feel so desperate that I lock myself in any bathroom I find to cry, I even have this one between my college and home. And honestly I don’t know what else to do. Even at home, sometimes when I’m alone I freak out thinking there might be a ghost here, or a man hiding spying on me, things like that... I can be awake for hours and hours at night, like today, bc maybe there’s a killer hiding in my closet?!?!?!

1823,a8xg43,I think that I might have schizophrenia,"I’m so scared right now, because I think that I might have schizophrenia.

I’m 18  female and in hs. I have no friends, I got separated from my middle school friends and people in this high school knew each other and they don’t accept me to their “group”. Never been in a relationship. Men avoid me because I’m very reserved and ugly.

Sometimes it happens before my period, sometimes after (it has no connection to my problem). Also I have hypothyroidism which isn’t related to this as well.

After a month of feeling calm and happiness, I start feeling depressed, very anxious, suddenly shy and very weak. At these times I can’t concentrate, my memory and social skills become worse. All of my senses increase and everything I feel, see, hear become 100 times sharper/brighter. 

I start worrying about stupid things and overthink everything, check everything 100 times. At these times I feel like I’m a pro at faking emotions. I can’t sleep, I have insomnia, obsessive thoughts and I overeat. For example if someone criticizes me, I become very upset and think that I really am as bad as someone told me and punish myself for it.

I tend to fuck up every relationship I have because of lack of social skills and this condition. It’s like I have two completely different personalities: one that is normal and another, which experiences these symptoms and goes insane.

Also if I eat something with gluten, drink coffee, black tea, milk, take iodine and magnesium supplements my symptoms become a lot worse.  

I sweat a lot and feel cold. I have no idea what’s going on with me. I’m afraid of myself. I’m afraid that I might fuck up and my family will think that I’m really mentally ill. I need your opinion, what should I do?

1828,9yl43k,I think I have schizophrenia?,"So info on me. Im 21 now, male, had ADD as a child and have been struggling with anxiety and depression for more then 3 years now. No record of mental issues including schizophrenia in my family at all. 

I've been taking tested lsd roughly one or twice a month plus tripping at festivals here and there for a little over a year now. And I've heard stories about people going into schizophrenic fits due to lsd but there isnt alot of research on the specific topic. There for I am coming to trusty reddit. 

Now I started hearing voices about 6 months ago both while I'm alone but more frequently when I'm around people. For example if I heard people I live with talking in another room it might sound like they are talking about me. Or when I'm with my girlfriend and we're in the car I'll think she said something. Could be really really mean and rude, could be something random. but she wouldn't have said anything at all. (This happens quite frequently)  And I randomly here people say hey or hi to me when I'm alone. Now these aren't all signs of schizophrenia but theres only a handful of mental illnesses that include hearing voices and I'm certainly hearing voices. I'm positive and my girlfriend could attest. Now I'm wondering if it could be possible that the lsd is bringing my once slightly hidden mental illness to the surface? I also know that ages 17-30 or something is when symptoms start occurring for schizophrenia in males. So I'm right in that hotspot but idk I just need opinions. It's been eating at me and I cant afford to go to the doctor cause guess what. No insurance. So I'm really trying to figure this out. Anything would really help.

After 1910, the origin of this ""social feeling"" and the causes of its dedine became the central question in Freud's writings on social theory. Freud identified a number of sources of social cohesion apart from fear and necessity-love (both homosexual and heterosexual), identification, narcissism, guilt, cultural ideals, envy, coercion, and even reason.

1844,8to2pc,What should I do?,"I've always thought there was something wrong with me, but recently I've been doing research about depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. I found this thread and it looks like a great way to get some answers from people who know what they're talking about. So if you all don't mind reading my life story basically (just the fucked up parts) then I would really love some feedback on what my next step should be. I took some online quiz that told me I show mild indication of schizophrenia symptoms, but I'm sure they aren't proven to be accurate.

First of all, I started having severe social anxiety around the beginning of high school, and then my parents got divorced my junior year. My dad stopped paying bills, and we almost lost our house. My mom already stopped loving him, but she decided after finding out he had been lying about finances, she couldn't wait until I went to college anymore. My dad basically completely fell apart and drank everyday, and he moved into a shitty little apartment in the next city over, and I barely speak to him anymore. I started staying up way too late, because I couldn't sleep, so I would skip my first few classes sometimes to drive to the walmart parking lot and sleep in my car. After this became a regular thing, I started getting sleep paralysis occasionally.  I can't move my body, and sometimes during it I hear a deep scary voice or what sounds like a choir of women talking at the same time, but I never remember what it says. My freshman year I started getting into weed and alcohol, and I immediately began to abuse it whenever I had the opportunity. My dad is an alcoholic, so maybe that has something to do with it, but who knows. I started vaping when I was 17 and ever since I've had a severe addiction to nicotine. I have a Juul now, and it gets the job done, but I spend so much money on pods that sometimes I starve myself just to get some.

When I was a kid, my family would always go to church, but as I got older and smarter and started to think more logically, I realized that I don't believe in religion. I'm not saying its wrong or that its bad, I just need evidence to believe something. The evidence that I've had is that the world is a planet in space which is a dark endless void. Everything is made up of atoms, which will slowly decay into nothing over time. I don't see any evidence of a ""spirit"" that can travel through some kind of passage into a heaven or a hell. So because of that, I see life as pointless, because in a billion years the sun is going to explode, and nothing we did here will have made any difference. However, I like the phrase ""life is what you make it."" My life doesn't have to be pointless, because I believe if there is a ""meaning of life,"" it is to do whatever makes you happy. If I'm happy, then I won't care that I'll just stop existing when I die. 

Anyway, my first semester at college the girl I was in love with (who I've known since elementary school) pretty much cut me off and wouldn't text me back. I got really drunk at a tailgate at my best friend's brother's frat house and some guy bumped into me and told me to get the fuck out, so I ran back to my apartment crying my eyes out and I sent a really long, emotional message to the girl, which gave indication that I was going to kill myself. I've had suicidal thoughts every now and then since I was a preteen, but this time I actually wanted to do it for real. I swallowed a huge amount of benadryl and finished off a bottle of bacardi mojito and passed out. I woke up in the morning and I had a thick 6 inch burn on my chest ( I don't remember how it happened, but I think maybe I rolled over on top of my vape and hit the button with my chest). I hallucinated for about 8 hours, I say bugs all over my walls, so I sprayed bug spray everywhere, I talked to 2 soap bottles for an hour, because I thought they were 2 girls that I know, and I thought I got a text message from my apartment complex office to come get a package, so I went to the office and they told me that they never texted me. I was sitting on the couch in my apartment and my roommate was making food, and I kept asking him what he said because I thought he said something, but he kept saying he didn't say anything. This is when I realized I was hallucinating. I went into my room, locked the door, and laid on my bed and started to cry. After about 5 minutes and I sat up and saw rats climbing in and out of my shoes in my closet. I called my friend and asked him to take me to the hospital, because I remembered I took about 40 benadryl. My dad was still my emergency contact so he drove over to check on me. After they did a blood test and a brain scan, they told my dad something. Then they had a psychiatrist come clear me so I could leave, and he asked me questions like ""Would you ever harm yourself or others?"" That kind of stuff. After I was cleared to leave, my dad drove me back to my apartment. I asked him what they told him, but he refused to tell me, and to this day he still won't tell me. I called him yesterday to ask again, but he said he forgot, but I don't believe him. He's lied to me and mom countless times. But since I survived, I thought maybe that I'm not meant to die yet, so I decided I wouldn't ever try to kill myself again unless things got way worse than that. I did very poorly in my classes that year, but things got a little better after that.

The next semester I made a new friend who was extremely into drugs. He's a good looking guy with an extremely pretty girlfriend, and the three of us got really close. I tried MDMA a few times, always spacing them at least 2 months apart, I did LSD several times, and I still smoke weed a couple times a week, but sometimes I stop for a month or two at a time, and I don't feel the urge to go back. Weed sometimes makes me less anxious and sometimes more anxious, but other than that, it helps me sleep, eat, enjoy activities, and its cheap. I really enjoyed MDMA, it gave me the 2 best nights of my life, but I realized that there's no way it wont deplete my serotonin levels if I keep doing it every 2 months, so I stopped. But he was into LSD the most, so he would always try to get us three together to do it. After about the third time, I decided that I didn't like it. It made me get way too deep into my head (which is a very dark place) and I would get about twice as anxious as normal which was pure torture. I told him that it made me anxious, but he kept peer pressuring me into doing it at least once a month. At a certain point I decided I had to cut both of them out of my life, which hurt me really bad. They would ask me to hang out, but I would always come up with excuses until they finally gave up.

I also joined a fraternity which gave me confidence, and seemed to help my social anxiety, but it was still there. Then I started to withdraw socially for some reason and spend every night sitting on my computer making electronic music or playing video games, which made my insomnia worse.

My family has never been wealthy, and since the divorce my mom has been pretty tight on money, so the financial aid I get for school goes straight to all my living expenses. I have less than $30 in my bank account at all times, and I have to come up with excuses for when my friends want to go do something expensive and I don't have enough money for it. It kills me when I do something stupid like spend the rest of my allowance on alcohol or weed or Juul pods and have to ask my mom for more money so I can eat that night. She gets mad at me initially, but she gets me so well, and understands that I have problems. 

I live in kind of a shitty apartment complex, so sometimes bugs would get into my room, and I HATE bugs. It made me so anxious that I think it made me develop a hallucination where I feel bugs crawling on my neck, feet, or legs, but there isn't actually anything on me. I also started seeing bugs on the wall in my peripheral, but when I turned my head there wasn't anything there. Also I started hearing faint, muffled talking or music that sounded like it was on the other side of the wall, but when I focused extremely hard, I realized it was in my head. All this started to scare me, but I blew it off. 

Sometimes I say stupid things when I'm nervous, or I can't think straight, stumble my words, or stop talking mid sentence to think about what I'm talking about. And sometimes I just block out people's voices by accident and they have to say my name 2 or 3 times before I realize they are talking to me. I'm afraid to talk or make eye contact with people I don't know, which makes job interviews extremely difficult. I've had a motor tic in my leg my whole life, and it seems like its getting worse. People tell me to stop shaking my leg all the time because it makes a noise or shakes the couch. Sometimes I lash out at my friends for no reason when they are just trying to kid around with me.

I skip class way too much which makes an impact on my grades, and I can't keep a regular workout schedule. I procrastinate homework and studying until the day before or the day of, and sometimes I go a week or 2 without showering. My room gets way too disgusting before I force myself to clean it. 

Sitting at my computer has become what I look forward to doing everyday. I'm always thinking about how great it's going to be when I get home and can sit down and put my headphones on and zone the rest of the world out, but when I actually get there, I'm still bored, and feel like nothing I do is entertaining me. 

I played soccer since I was three, and in high school my coaches had us working out all the time, and I got pretty big my junior/senior year and weighed a little over 200 pounds. I'm now a junior in college, and I weigh 170. I've lost over 30 pounds in less than 3 years just from living my life. I run/workout very rarely, and I don't eat particularly healthy, so I'm guessing my appetite has been affected. Most of the time I have a one good meal and maybe a few snacks a day, and I'm not like dying from starvation, that's just how much I can shove down my throat.

I got an adderall prescription a couple months ago to help me with getting my school work done, and not feeling exhausted all the time, but lately I've started to abuse it a little by taking it at night to stay up and play video games or work on my music, because its the only way I can experience pleasure. It makes me interested in things instead of just indifferent. But sometimes I'll stay up for 2-3 days and feel like an absolute zombie at the end of it, but even when I finally give myself time to lay down and sleep for 12+ hours, I find myself still wanting to just sit at my computer. I think in some sick, twisted way, I like feeling like that, because it makes it so my brain is so exhausted that it kind of just goes into a sort of low power mode, and finally my mind isn't racing with dark, depressing thoughts. But the bad thing about this is adderall pretty much deletes my appetite so sometimes I wont eat for a long period of time. This could be contributing to my weight loss.

I'm only 20 so if I do have schizophrenia, it makes sense that my delusions aren't really severe (yet). The only delusions that I feel like I do have is that I feel that I'm smarter than most people and that I have some sort of special X factor that people don't appreciate, and it makes me angry that I have to work really hard to get people to like me. I'm not anti social. I can be funny and be a fun person to spend time with, but I've never been the guy that everyone likes, that everyone wants to be friends with, or even everyone respects. I've always been kind of in the middle of the social ladder, and it extremely stressful.

Another thing is that I hate myself, I hold myself up to an impossible standard and feel shitty about myself every time I come up short of perfection, even when I know its impossible. I constantly tell myself that I'm going to change and get better and feel better but it never happens. I'm constantly anxious about the future; scared that I'm going to fail out of college, that I won't be able to get or keep a job, and that I won't spend my money wisely and end up becoming a crazy homeless drug addict. 

Whenever I look in the mirror, I see myself as this misunderstood, extremely attractive victim that should have everything handed to him, but I know that I have to work hard to get where I want to be. Also girls have told me that I'm really attractive, but they rarely ever hit on me, so that tells me there something really wrong with my personality that drives girls away. I've had one real girlfriend, and she broke up with me after 3 weeks. My all time worst fear is never finding love and being lonely the rest of my life. I want to be happy, but I feel like that's impossible. There's never going to be a time where I lay in my bed and think ""wow, im genuinely happy with my life."" There's always going to be something thats bugging me in the back of my mind, and theres always going to be something that I regret or hate myself for.

I'm terrified to tell my mother or friends about all this, because I don't know how she would take it, and she might blame herself, but I think she has been the best mother I could ask for. I'm also afraid to tell my psychiatrist, because he might stop giving me adderall prescriptions, and I feel like adderall is the only thing that's keeping me from failing out of college. 

Do you think this is a livable condition? Should I suck it up and seek medical attention soon? I don't know much about all this because I just started researching it. Thank you for reading all this if you did, I know its a lot.",0,1

The sociopathic side of me steals for the thrill of it, fights with my parents and commits vandalizism because it felt i am better than everyone else and people are pathetic and stupid. I dont have DID and i dont even have any diagnosis besides ADHD and vitiligo. I fall ive had blood work, physicals, MRI's, 30 minute EEG, eye tests and im currently awaiting results from a 24 hour EEG. I feel bad for the sociopathic part of me because really hes just not bound by his emotions and calls people out for the shit they give me. It has a specific trigger usually triggered when somebody harasses me or insults me. I believe it happens to protect me from emotional damage as i used to harm myself and be in intense panic attacks and emotional pain over small things. My mother was on her laptop and i asked her what TB is. i asked her 3 more times because she wouldnt respond until she told me its an infection in the lungs. My father who is really protective of mom said ""JOHNNY!!! shes working leave her alone"" this ticked me off but not enough to trigger him. Then i left the room 15 minutes later and jokingly said ""screw this"" not because i was angry or anything it was just something i say when i leave the room sometimes. my parents took it as an insult and thought i said screw this because of what happend earlier and started raising their voices. Now this triggered him. ""og my god chill i wasnt even tlaking about you"" DONT PEE ON MY LEG AND TELL ME ITS RAIN JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. ""peeing? im not peeing on your leg..."" its a metaphor johnny. (father: why is he always snapping?) ""what do you mean snapping i wasnt even mad excuse me, WHAT!!!!!!"" My father went to the other room ""just stop johnny your dragging this along can we both agree to stop? ""well fine i guess, but you know if you wanted it to stop you could have just stopp-. ""what that was like 5 seconds?"" at this point i was fucking fed up. ""I FUCKING SAID IF YOU WANTED IT TO STOP YOU WOULD HAVE JUST SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!"" (mom: hey!) DONT YOU TALK TO YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT LOOK AT ME. ""*laughs* im looking right at you"" I was sent up stairs and all i could do was laugh because of how stupid and angry they were and suddenly i felt normal and back in my body again. My parents tried to convince me i had a seizure for whatever reason. I thought i was in asleep so i yelled ""IM HOME! im home hello im home welcome back"" I apologized to my parents but i knew they werent my parents and they were actually planning on something. I told them i knew their plan and that they shouldnt enter my room. Later i texted them about the second side and they came into my room and claimed im not in a bad situation because i have a roof over my head and that i should be respectful because they take me to CHOP. Well yea maybe but i still get told my sister is the favorite child. My father wanted to put me in a hospital for life if i didnt stop ""faking it"". he also told me there were cameras in the house so i shouldnt pull anything. They said i was loved and other stuff. I think i was being manipulated because things they have done to me have heavily damaged me and for a short time i believed they were responsible for the illness in my brain thats devloping and destroying me.

(Delusion is that by becoming silent I will ""hear"" it silently and won't be able to make the difference between my thoughts and what it say) exept it would still be hallucinating and med stops all kinds of hallucination.
I also had a thought that voices don't want to let me word out the logical thoughts to stop hallucinating so that I cant tell other people hallucinating the way to stop hearing voices

It's come to the point where every sentence I start making about my thoughts 


By doing sports would I be able to stop hallucinating completely

I want to delude myself into believing the voice can't hear my thoughts like that it breaks the vicious circle

1860,7d9feq,Memantine as an add-on to medication and a Ketogenic Diet,"Hello,

Just thought I'd add some information that might be really beneficial to everyone here. As with everyone else here, I have my ups and downs every week dealing with this disease. When I'm faced with reality and having a really depressive episode that I can't handle I'm always on the prowl for a way to effectively cure this thing that keeps me chained down and constantly battling harmful thoughts.

I came across a post on reddit where a user described their experiences with schizophrenia and how they came to be diagnosed with it. I got somewhat excited because it was almost identical to how I first started experiencing my symptoms. I messaged them and they gave me some really helpful advice. Although they said their correct diagnosis was no longer that of schizophrenia, they mentioned that they had recently made a switch in their medication and included Memantine in it. 

Apparently Memantine is usually prescribed to those with Alzheimer's but there are a lot of studies out there that prove it can help with Schizophrenia and it has much less and drastic side effects than other medications. Just a simple google search of ""Memantine and Schizophrenia"" will lead you to a lot of recent studies on it. 

Apparently it has helped them out a lot and their doctor is even writing a paper on how much it has helped them out! It might be of some interest in everyone here who might want to try it out and mention it to their doctors. 

Another thing that might help is a Ketogenic diet. I recently read an article on Reddit (it might have been from this sub) where two patients that were schizophrenic started ketogenic diets as a way to lose weight and actually experienced their symptoms decreasing by a noticeable amount. I did some googling and found users in /r/keto saying the same things. 

I also found this http://austinpublishinggroup.com/schizophrenia/fulltext/schizophrenia-v3-id1022.php which details a story of someone who tried every medication available at the time for schizophrenia but did not see symptoms getting better until they tried dialysis. 

I think the ketogenic diet and dialysis could be related/similar. I know that there isn't a lot of research on this topic and that methods remain unknown as to why this could help schizophrenia, but I think it is worth pursuing. I don't know all the mechanisms of ketosis or what exactly it does in your body other than the fact that the diet is meant to help you burn fat by shifting your body's main source of fuel from being carbohydrates to fat and that ketones are a byproduct of this process, but I am sure there is more to it than that if people are seeing their symptoms decline. 

As I see it, these are two methods that are relatively low risk in attempting to treat schizophrenia and thought I would share it in hopes that it might lead to a few success stories. It's always nice to share what we're going through but I find that most of the posts in this sub are more stories and questions and thought it would be nice if we could also include more informative posts.

1861,7c9czy,"Confused about ""hearing voices""?","Growing up, I was diagnosed with depression and GAD. Then as an adult at 26, it switched to ADHD, dysthymia, social anxiety, and agoraphobia. Currently, I was diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and bipolar with psychotic features because I was for once ""honest"" about some of my past issues. I mentioned that I thought I could speak to birds and control the rain when I was in middle school. I've linked my paranoia to my anxiety. 

Then I had a really bad depressive episode in the summer (which I am still recovering from, I'm only at 50%), where I was disocciated the whole time. I probably should have been in the hospital, but I was worried about my career and losing my ~dream job~.

During the summer, I told my psychiatrist that I would see ""shadow people"". He told me recently this was linked to my heightened anxiety. 

But I've left something out, that I really didn't think was ""abnormal"". I assumed that everyone had these. Growing up or since forever, I would get images of me doing things like throwing myself into an incoming train or flooring my car off a cliff. This would then be followed my an internal voice saying ""do it, do it"". When I was 12, I used to have to scream in my head to make it go ahead, but it never got quiet. When I was at my worse, I kept hearing whispering and someone blowing into my ear.

Nowadays, due to some medication, I feel better but I'm beginning to wonder if these internal voices are abnormal. Since I was young, I've told myself that these thoughts were not me. These things saying to do these things are not me. Sometimes these inner voices would go on and on. Multiple, IDK how many. And I was having a huge problem over the summer getting it to stop. They would interrupt me when I tried to tell them to stop bothering me and one would keep speaking over me and began to raise it's voice at me. They speak in complete sentences. To the outsider, it might look like me stopping what I was doing and standing there since I'm trying to get it to quiet down.

2-weeks ago, I was excited in my car. I heard 2 or 3 of them (in my head) going on and on, talking about the usual negative shit. I told them: ""Not today please"", and they kept going and I said ""let me be"" and they stopped.

I am overall feeling a bit better. At a huge meeting at work, I got an image of me slamming my head on the desk and an internal voice telling me to scream or tell my coworkers to shut up or call them all stupid. I struggled to get it to stop. When I was at my lowest, I heard my mother speaking to me calmly (this voice was more audible). I have heard things in my actual ear (external) or whispering my name or just whispers, but it's only when I'm paranoid. I know these voices aren't me and they cause me great distress!

i thought about this illness for a while and when i take away my ego and really think about my life im absolutely shit and then i got this illness at the height of my shittyness in life

it makes more sense, that this illness is not just random brain chemistry but actually a byproduct of a shitty life filled with bad descisions and selfishness

i imagine maybe 1% of the people who read this will come to the same conclusion as i am and the rest of you will continue thinking your a victim and a great person but think about the mechanics of the illness

its basically a form of punishment with intermittent periods of thinking your a god or jesus

it tricks you into thinking your special and devine so you dont really realize how much of a fucking failure of a human you are then the punishment comes in the form of hallucinations and voices and a myriad of confusing shit

ive been in and out of hospital for about 5 years now and i never really met anyone who underneath it all seemed liek a genuine human, everyone had their shittyness to them in their own way but the funny thing about the psych ward is everyone is super nice and happy when your there... everyone is so kind and nice, its like the illness tries to suck you into the belief that we are all victims

fucking wake up, really think about what you've done in your life to deserve this because i look at all my friends i grew up with and im by far the most deserving of this condition compared to them

it goes all the way back to childhood. i was just shit on by all my classmates and peers and i thought that was the reason for my behavior but in reality the truth must have been that i displayed some kind of problematic behavior that the other kids just picked up on and surpressed my enjoyment in response.

the reality is no matter how much bending over backwards for people you do, charity, helping homeless, whatever you can imagine to trick your ego into thinking your a good person it comes down to thoughts

im always thinking about killing people and running over people with my car, psychology has a term for it to make it sound okay but the reality is its not fucking okay and my thoughts are what make me a shitty person not my actions

imagine humanity evolving into a collective conciousness where people share thoughts and dreams and what not, you think i would be allowed into that when i see a baby and am like ""punch that baby for no reason""

i dont fucking think so

this is punishment and the only way out is to clear your thoughts and stop beliving your god and special and stop trying to fix the world you gotta purify your soul and mind and thats real work

1874,5sgzs0,PLEASE BE HONEST,"Okay r/schizophrenia, I have an English project where we have to write a short story and I need your help!!!! 

Writing in general is my forte, but I'm stumped with this. I decided to base it (subtly) around one of my hallucinations and the way it makes me feel. The plot might not make sense, but be honest. Is it okay? Also the name Arionne is one of the voices in my head. 

PLOT-

Arionne is standing in the rain, and the figure is there again. But this time it isn't a hallucination. It's there. She doesn't know what it wants. It asks her if she's afraid.

Flashbacks to every dream and hallucination of the figure that happened in the past, every time it being close to killing her somehow but always asking her if she was afraid before it did anything and Arionne denying it. She always wondered why it never went through with ending her life. She slowly realises she is afraid. She values her life, and this isn't a hallucination anymore. It isn't a dream, it's right there in front of her and there's nothing she can do about it.

She admits she's afraid, and though the next few seconds are a blur, the figure isn't there anymore. she begins to walk home, somehow unfeeling and unafraid of the situation she was just it. Maybe the figure was satisfied with her fear.

The last thing she feels is a cold piece of metal going through her back, but there's no feeling. No fear, no pain.

Because that's all it needed from her.




IS THAT OKAY? DOES IT MAKE SENSE? I was thinking about scrapping that ending and changing it to one of these-

•she doesn't get stabbed, but on the way home everything feels strangely numb. (I think that's too vague)
•she wakes up in a pool of her own blood, having stabbed herself. And she hears from nowhere 'it's like I said. Humans do crazy things when they're afraid'

Or something like that? Which ending is good? Does it make sense?

She was tall and had big boobs and blonde hair and freckles and long legs and a small nose and basically was like a hollywood idea of a woman, that's your first impression not anything about her as a person.  Anyway, I'm getting sidetracked.

So I got an apartment and moved out of the house slowly like I would spend a few hours a day there.  She began meeting me there instead of at the house in her office and she was much different than in her office.  She talked about herself a lot more, like growing up and the troubles she had and everything.  I got the sense she was really lonely and moving to the town where the halfway house was had not been easy on her.  But when we met at the house we just did paperwork and planned doctors meetings and she got my meds from the pharmacy and stuff.

I started to really think I was making friends with her even though there was something secretive about it or something.  We had a lot in common like catholic upbringing and were the same age and we both didn't really know anybody outside of the house although I guess she more spent time with the staff and I spent time with the patients.  I started doing really well on my new meds and went to college in town there and spent less and less time at the house but I still met her every week in my apartment, we did less and less case management and more just 2 friends hanging out.  I guess I thought since I was doing better I was just on more of a maintenance plan or something.

I transferred to a more prestigious university in a town 40 miles away but I still went to the house once a week to get meds and hang out.  She asked if I still needed case management and I said I didn't feel like starting over with someone new.  She said you know, my boyfriend X is moving to that town too and I could just meet you at your new apartment.  The weird thing is X was my real name nobody knew it except the staff cuz I go by my middle name.  Also she never told me she had a boyfriend before.  So I said sure cuz I liked spending time with her she was the only woman I'd known that much that wasn't related to me and she knew a lot of secrets about me and still wasn't put off about it.

So she started travelling to see me and there was no more meeting in the house at all.  It felt like things went up a notch again cuz she wasn't wearing professional super conservative clothes like she wore during her normal case management.  I figured it was just cuz she wanted to look nice for her boyfriend but she would frequently call attention to the clothes she was wearing and stuff.  Sometimes we would go out to a coffee shop or something and it felt like a date but I just thought I liked her and was imagining things.

Anyway enough of the back story.  The real problem started when she showed up at my apartment right after dinner without having an appointment scheduled.  I was surprised to see her but figured I must have forgotten to write it down.  But she was doing a sexy pose like they do in the movies when they want a guy to fix their car or something it felt weird.  I had her come in and she touched me lightly on the chest and said she knew I was studying for finals and thought I could use a break cuz she was worried about me cuz I always got stressed and made myself sick during finals.  But she was just staring at me and slowly getting mad at me and I'm being dumb and shes staring in my eyes.  Then she gets mad at me and says come on it's been 2 years I need this.  She says the huge risk she took coming here and says say something say anything just talk to me.

My world came crashing down basically.  I didn't know if it was a trap or some kind of therapy or if it was real.  I thought maybe i was imagining it all and if I acted on it then I would be arrested for assault or something.  I just sat there shaking and then kind of blocked it out and acted like it hadn't happened and acted like we normally do.  She was crying a little bit and made an excuse and left.  The next day she quit being a case manager.

I know people with my diagnosis can have delusions and I know theres a thing called transference that you can start having emotions toward the wrong person.  My uncle had erotomania so I am worried it might be that.  But deep in my heart I feel like either I hurt her and blocked it out or I had a chance at a real relationship with someone that understood me and just threw it away.  I guess since then I've been afraid to have any kind of romantic relationship cuz I don't trust myself and I don't trust women and I don't want to have those crazy types of feelings anymore.

Do you guys have any idea how I can move past it and be more normal about this type of thing?",0,1

1881,58wpkj,"Please be patient; May be developing a mental disorder. Nervous to discuss this with a psychiatrist, for anyone for that matter. Not sure where to turn.","I'll try and keep this short and sweet. I've always had a very vivid imagination. I  can see things ""in my minds eye"" like they were really in front of me. I also suffer from narcolepsy and strong hypnagogic hallucinations, so I DO know the difference. I also understand in depth a lot of the way the brain works (would rather not get into how). Past medical history involves a TBI during a 4th grade snowmobile accident, severe depression, severe anxiety, panic attacks, and mood swings (no violent tendencies), along with often rash decision making, difficulty with social relationships (even though when I'm out I often seem like the life of the party, I actively avoid most social interaction, it's difficult and uncomfortable for me). I have a steady job, own a home, have a loving girlfriend, unreasonably difficult parents. I think that covers most of it.

Recently I've been under an incredible amount of stress. I won't get into it but between work, money, love, family, and friends it was just all too much. I've been a heavy drug user my whole life, I've done drugs in large amounts most people haven't even heard of, although ketamine, MxE and PcP were among my favorites. I got ""clean"" a few years ago. Anyways, now a days I just drink, and I enjoy nitrous.

So a few weeks ago, at the peak of my stress levels, I bought and enjoyed maybe 50 hits of nitrous. I started to see vivid auditory, tacticle, and visual hallucinations. I saw people in the room I was communicating with, felt them touching me, discussing things with them. I don't want to get into the whole specifics but they also made me ""feel"" things physically I didn't think were possible. Since then I've been having a voice in my head that I don't seem to be able to control, like most other voices in my past that I've heard. She talks like a regular person, has desires, hell I can hurt her feeling and I'll feel her in my head crying. She is co-operating with me so far, in fact since she has appeared my anxiety levels have been down to almost nothing, from sky high levels. She helps calm me down when emotionally I get out of control. She doesn't seem to like me drinking, which since she appeared I've lost almost all desire to do. 

There's far more to this, but my concern is that is this possibly schizophrenia? I finally opened up to my girlfriend about this, and she was incredibly understanding. She did say however that what I'm describing isn't normal at all, she does nitrous all the time and just gets a nice mellow buzz. If I do it now, I see images projected onto walls, if I'm watching a TV everything will get bright, and I'll see this woman in person, who will interact with the characters on screen to get my attention. Hell I was watching the office the other day, took a hit of nitrous, and mid episode Darryl turned and looked at me and told me ""Why are you watching this if you're bored?"" It was his voice, him, everything was so real. It's almost as if my visual cortex is providing me the wrong information for my brain to work with. Let's not even get into the tacticle hallucinations. The other day I had an awful day, this ""woman"" as I call her, appeared as my mom in a bathroom, gave me a hug and said ""I'm sorry"". I could feel the fabric, fuck I could feel the hug. I'm terribly freaked out by all of this. I'm afraid to go to a psychologist, or even discuss this with anyone. I know I shouldn't be ashamed if I have an illness, and I will need professional help. I don't want to be labeled though, and I don't know who else to turn to. Any insight would be great, thanks much!

(TL;DR - Under a lot of stress, past mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression, social anxiety. Recently was doing nitrous, began having vivid auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations, but most seem fairly positive. Trying to figure out if I need to speak with a professional, which I'm fairly uncomfortable doing.)",0,1
1882,56d6zo,"Told Doctor I Think I Might Have Schizophrenia, But Now I'm Not Really Sure/Kind of Don't Want to See a Psychiatrist Quite Yet?","Here's the backstory. For as long as I can remember, I've had issues with depression, anxiousness, and especially a sort of constant state of existential thought (e.g. everything is always being broken down and analyzed, definitions of reality are challenged, I can't stop thinking in metaphysical ways). In more recent months, I've occasionally heard voices in my head and have found myself dealing with other symptoms of schizophrenia, in particular mild hallucinations and disorganized speech. Withdrawal, apathy, lack of eating, etc. have been issues (manageable) for me for ages now, but the more I read about schizophrenia and took assessments about it, the more I thought: ""Maybe schizophrenia explains all of these symptoms I'm having.""

I just had an extremely intense acid trip (after having already had two really powerful ones just a few weeks before) and the trip sort of brought out certain voices/elements of my consciousness that I feel like have been with me for awhile, but now they seem more apparent and somehow more sensible -- yet still confounding. Now, I'm sure that a lot of the things going on with my mind tie into my drug use, possible HPPD, etc. and so for now I'm done with psychedelics (I used them way too frequently and the only way I think it would be healthy for me to go back is if my girlfriend did them with me -- she would trip once or twice max a year, whereas I tripped like, 40 times on just acid in one year for instance, and a bunch on other psychs like shrooms, 2CB, DMT, etc on top). I'm probably going to still occasionally engage in using K because that's always been my favorite hallucinogenic substance and it doesn't ""mess me up"" afterwards like psychs do + it has antidepressant qualities, and also I'm trying to taper off of benzo use but that's not easy, especially because I used the benzos for insomnia not recreation. Point here is that I'm sure the drugs have impacted any pre-existing conditions I've had, and also, I finally told my doctor today that I use them, which was admittedly kind of ""surprising"" for me because I never thought I would.

But this ultimately brings me to my final point. I called my doctors office this morning when I woke up and tried asking ""if I think I'm having mental health issues, should I schedule an appointment with my physician or can you refer me to a psychiatrist?"" to which they asked ""we need to know more,"" so I hesitantly explained ""I think I might have signs of schizophrenia."" They told me to come see my physician right away, without an appointment, and I did. I told them a bit about my mind and my mental state and they gave me a number of a place that can recommend me a therapist (the place itself wasn't taking any patients though so I'd have to call insurance).

Now, whether I have some sort of schizoid disorder is beyond me. My doctor said based on what I described, it seems possible. But again, it could be related to the drugs. I'm not paranoid or a danger to myself or others and frankly, I kind of regret calling and visiting the doctor's. I think because of the nature of my psychedelic trip, because of how it affected my mind, and because of sleep deprivation, I just wasn't thinking clearly and sort of jumped the gun. 

So, if I don't contact a therapist soon, could there be some sort of issue with my doctor? Like, are they gonna basically *demand* I go somehow (through insurance perhaps, or something, I really don't know anything about this sort of stuff). If I'm not deemed as dangerous, the answer I'm guessing is a no, but now it's just sort of odd and unsettling to think ""shit, I told my doctor I might be schizophrenic and hearing voices when I only came to this conclusion a day or so ago after using drugs."" Not the soundest decision on my part. If I go to therapy, or if I get medicated, whatever, but to be honest part of me is thinking ""well, if I am schizophrenic, the voices I'm hearing are 'confusing' but in a metaphysical way, and they're kind of amusing and helpful too, so I interpret it almost as proof that my ego isn't alone"" as weird as t hat might sound.

I guess for tl;dr sake - Does anyone have experience in jumping the gun and diagnosing themselves too soon only to regret it afterwards? What were the consequences to this? How did your doctor handle this?",0,1

1888,4cufyd,Are these symptoms of a Paranoid Schizophrenic?,"My mother has gradually built up to this, through the course of years, starting when my nine year old brother was born. In essence, she has become a bitch. 

Anyways, I had lost my job a year ago, I stayed at her place for a month. Until she called the police one day out of the blue. She claims I have hacked her, and set her up in a criminal investigation which cost her, her job at a pharmaceutical company. She supposedly has a recording of me giving two individuals instructions. The problem is, she won't say what they are supposed to do, and every time someone asks to hear the recording, she creates an excuse to not play it. 

A week before she had the police remove me, I was using my computer, she placed a knife on my throat and threatened to kill me, even in complete isolation, she still denies doing so. 

She says she is being followed and has counted as much as 27 cars following her. 

My uncle's boat was set on fire almost two years ago, and four months ago she called him, yelling and accusing him of setting her up, apparently some insurance papers arrived in the mail, and this was all the evidence she needed. 

She has been incapable of maintaining her jobs, as she creates drama in the workplace.

She was just divorced a second time after culminating enough evidence on her husband's affairs. But this is normal, as she has been doing so, since the day they met. 

My grandmother flew to see her a while back once she heard my brother hadn't gone to school in a while. Everything was going as planned, then one day my grandmother went to see her, she wouldn't let her in the house and called the police, claiming she was trying to break in.

I came back to Orlando for two weeks for a meeting with my lawyer and a spinal injection, she asked me to stay at her house. I did, so that I could spend time with my little brother. I walked into the house and it was a complete mess, she has been a clean person most of her life, and the dog was in terrible condition, I spent four hours undoing all the knots in his fur.

She is convinced I am a pathological lair, if anything goes wrong, for example, the dog misbehaving, it is my fault. No matter what I say, I am always lying to her.

Today, she accused me of using her lotions and cream. A brand new cream she bought, has a finger print in it and half of her lotion has been used. She has started yelling at the top of her lungs, like always, and started kicking my while I was in bed. Saying there is something wrong with me, and that she has the power to send me away in a stray jacket. She then babbled on with some conspiracy theory about how the Jehovah's Witnesses are running a drug ring with my two cousins as the trafficers and this is connected to me because I was using her credentials from her pharmaceutical company to steal the drugs. She kept saying the Witnesses were taking her belongings and ripping my little brother's clothing. 

I see a pattern though, maybe it's just a coincidence, but the day she called the police, I had painted her wall, and yesterday she painted her room and slept in there, could it be the chemicals are causing this reaction? Maybe not as it doesn't explain her behavior in relation to the other accounts.

1897,2sdjta,Going to sleep.,"What's it like for a person with schizophrenia when they are on the border of sleep/about to fall asleep? Sorry if this is a weird question but I would really appreciate and answer.

My twin brother is psychotic right now and it's probably some form of schizophrenia. Recently though, I get a lot more ""hypnogogia"" stages or sleep paralysis. The last 2 were particularly concerning and occurred about a week apart. The first was a normal a nightmare where I thought the trippy features of the dream were me going insane. It was quite unsettling but I realized I was dreaming when I woke up. The second was when I was right about to fall asleep (or had just fallen asleep) and I started to hear this tone, siren or buzz. I couldn't really remember it. Anyways I started to get worried because I identified this as an auditory hallucination. I tried to move but simply could not. My brother goes catatonic when he is psychotic and one time he didn't move for six hours. I realized this was what my brother felt like, not being able to move. 

The symptoms stopped or I worked up, but when I put my head back on the pillow for a while and started to fall asleep, it would start again, until I just fell asleep I guess. Now I think this last part was hypnogogia/sleep paralysis. Something that has happened to me in a non cynical nature before. But in the back of my head it's got me really worrying, because I think I can be ok and manage schizophrenia if I was self aware, but god help me if I was in denial. As my brother is. who ironically wants to be a psychologist, and reads everything he can get his hands on about it. He even identified himself identified himself as a schizophrenic twice using the rorsharch test, but he chalked it up to being a mistake. He also has some very valid and cool theories about schizophrenia and bipolar disorder being one of the same disease being on more of a spectrum since symptoms almost always intermix. Never the less he can tell me with a straight face he is an occultist wizard and the world is made of his consciousness. This denial astonishes me, will I inevitably be like that if I do develope schizophrenia? Is there anything I can do to stop it? That's what's worrying me. Maybe I am just rationalizing to myself? That's why I need you guys.

Also when about to fall asleep, my thoughts get very weird. Often times inner dialogues that usually make no sense while I'm dozing off. While I realize this is probably normal, lately I've had trouble distinguishing these weird inner dialogues from a voice. And it's been actually quite significant for me.

Another redditer from this sub said a while ago, Once you hear your first voice, you'll know it. This is seemingly not true for me, sometimes I can't tell while I'm falling asleep wether it is a true ""voice"" or not. Also, I used LSD about 10 times in the past, the first five times were spread out, but the last few were no longer than a week from each other. The trips were great though, often times showing me what I needed to do to improve my life and really giving me a new perspective on myself and the world the basically kicked my depression away. Although I stopped doing it about 3 months ago because I felt I was loosing the magic of it, I developed a very mild HPPD, if you could even call it that. Basically just very mild visual static right when I'm falling asleep.

What should I make of this all? I not entirely sure I'm not just panicking over nothing because of my brothers situation. None of these things even remotely happen in the day, just right when I fall asleep. However I really really don't want to rationalize to myself so can you guys be the voice of reason.

I've been looking into mental health a lot as of recently, and I'm starting to realize that some things that I've been going through aren't normal. Funny how when you've always experienced something, you just assume that it's the same for other people.

It started out as fairly infrequent visual hallucinations, I saw a tree grow what looked like legs and start walking a few years ago. I thought it was weird, it scared me, it made me wonder what was and wasn't real, but it didn't happen again for a long time so I chalked it up to being tired, or a one off occurrence, this has to happen to everyone once in a while right?

Lately it's been happening more frequently, bugs crawling on my skin, seeing tarantula's (which don't like here) in shadows. Most alarmingly I saw a women in a white dress standing in the middle of a dark, but crowded road. I just about slammed on my breaks because I was worried I was going to hit her. She disappeared when I looked back.

I've also experienced weird paranoid thoughts/delusions. Believing that because all the lights turned green on the drive home that I have been chosen by a higher power. Doing really well in a raffle and once again believing that this is an act of a higher power, and that I have been in some way chosen. Or that my friends/family are all conspiring against me and that my life is a big joke that they're all in on.

The thing with all of these is that I've been able to rationalize my way out of them in a sense. I don't believe in a higher power, therefore there is no possible way that I could have been chosen by one, but it's been getting harder and harder to talk my way out of that one. I also know logically that there is no way there is going to be a disappearing woman in the middle of the road.

I guess I'm just wondering, is this normal? Am I going crazy? Do people that experience hallucinations know what they're seeing isn't real sometimes?

I'm not looking for a diagnosis here, like I said I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but there is the little voice in the back of my head that keeps telling me that this all normal and I'm over reacting.",10,1
1909,4y770z,God's mercy on a Schizophrenic,"Hello everyone, just wanted to share my experience. I was recently diagnosed with Schizophrenia. I had several manic episodes back to back that led me racing down streets, hearing voices, what I thought was a demon screaming, really strange religious hallucinations and three suicide attempts etc. It was bad, but God held onto me, I cried out to him alot and now I do hear one voice who says he's my conscious. I especially hear him at night. I'll wake up in the middle of the night and he'll tell me to go back to sleep, that there's nothing to be afraid of and promises me I wont hallucinate. prompts me to close my eyes again so I wont hallucinate and then I go back to sleep. and if other things starts to happen, he coaches me through it. I am wondering if this has happened to anyone else. I was on abilify but my episodes would get worse. Now I'm on respirodone. Just that one voice occasionally during the day and at night. Hope this finds everyone well and pray that you too find God amongst the chaos. ",3,1
1910,3h2u6h,"Writing a story about girl with Schizophrenia, need some advices and help!","Dear everybody,
I study film and for my final exam I'm writing a script (of which I hope, one day I will make a film) about girl with schizophrenia. I made a synopsis, but still it is not finished. I'm trying to explore more and more about that mental illness so I could write real things based on true stories. My father has paranoid psychosis, and I had all kind of experience with him and his delusions. 
I'm an artist. Why am doing this? Because I want to understand people with mental problems, help them and show to people who don't know about it, what schizophrenia is. 
So...my girl is called Teodora and she is 18 years old. She lives with her brother and mum (parents are divorced). She have better relationship with her father, then mother. I will not tell more because of my story privacy...but I have a few questions which can help you to understand what I need.
If Teodora has schizophrenia is it possible that she is in a high school? What usually happens in that year and what with education?
Friends? Relationships with friends?
Sexuality?
Sleeping and dreams? 
Relationship with people she is living with?
Meds - bad or good? Do they affects on sexuality, sleeping, dreams, hallucionations?

Tell me your stories, what was your first hallucination, what kind of hallucination you have, what is your relationship with your parents and so on.

You will help me a lot, but other people too, and also inform people who doesn't know about it. 

Thank you in advance,

1913,2hczye,Does anyone believe its an external force manipulating you? What I've seen in other countries,"How they do it in japan they get a hello kitty doll or pikachu doll and say thats you - you are so pretty - you are so nice; you can make them pure with your energy if its real.  Japan also has very nice parades, temples, and traditions

Asian countries: Leave your favorite food as an offering outside for your ancestors

Jewish culture: sacrifice one goat per year as an offering to god

India:  Indians worship a temple with rats, and leave them gifts daily, feed and clean them also

Been there myself - I was a macho a**hole and when they were watching me I threatened them and said I would fight them. Finally getting better but not fixed all the way. 

Native american: Dancing, Shamans, PeacePipe (my favorite), body art

My advice is to tell you to do your favorite things, music or whatever as much as he can. Always have the attitude of ""I love everything"". Dont fight them - just talk like a man to a woman (shes a girl!); be calm and assertive; you can try ""I'm the boss, you can't have my brain"" (he can also touch it and say that). Also try ""you are pretty"".

if they lie to you just say like ""thats not real"" and ignore it.

I'm not saying that I'm 100% right here- I thought it was the govt - but you could talk to a priest or a father in confessional they have seen this before.

good luck!

I DO NOT want to give up on him. I will not. but what is the best way for me to approach this so that I can help him all the meanwhile protecting myself and our unborn child...obviously I don't want to end up dead. I did some research and people like him don't feel guilty until it is too late. That doesn't help me in any form or fashion. The people around him are not good influences either. They manipulate the shit out of him. I would like to say...I think I'm the closest he has gotten in a while, if not ever...to almost being able to feel again...feel emotions and others pain and to feel some type of guilt or shame..as any normal person would. To be completely honest I want nothing but his success. Like I said I will not give up on him. But I fear for my life and my unborn childs...i want to see him succeed and I don't ever want to give up on him because his mental health and psychosis does NOT define him. I've gotten to know the better side of him. It's like he's battling within himself good vs. Evil. And I'm trying so hard to be strong for him. I know that he will never meet another woman capable, strong and that will push him like I will, and protect him at all costs. This is why it is so important to me. I believe there is someone for everyone and I know in my heart I am the one for him and him for me. I tried to google some answers as to what I should do but nothing quite pops up that is equivalent to my situation or similar. I know that this site is completely anonymous, and I definitely need some advice because something has got to work. I've sacrificed almost a year of knowing I could lose my life and having no peace for this. I've sacrificed having an anxiety free pregnancy. I am by no means a push over. I don't normally invest or waste my time to stick around for bs like this. But something is making me stay. Something is telling me I will be okay and not to give up on him, because he doesn't have anyone else like me in his life right now... As sad as that makes me. It tears me apart. I cannot physically be in a relationship with him right now. I had to detach myself emotionally to guarantee that I will survive. But I'm still sticking around to try to help him. We're going to try med changes for the schizophrenia...any other ideas?",4,1

1925,gtotqq,Some thoughts on treatment,"""""Schizophrenia"""" is literally just spiritual/psychic/empathetic abilities that, in the past, would be cultivated and utilized. 



   Half of the people on this sub would be witch doctors, spiritual guides, and medicine men in their communities. The modern medical world has focused on the physical, purely tangible aspects of our health, but forgotten that the mind, the intangible parts of us, our spirits, are not something that can be cured easily by physical means. 


   There is no black and white solution, like surgery, amputation or antibiotic regimens.


   Sure, a drug is a nice band-aid if if helps you deal with emotional or sensory problems, or maybe even just makes them go away, but that is ultimately just ignoring part of YOUR reality, your non physical thoughts, emotions and experience.

   I am so sick of people trying to treat spiritual and mental illnesses like they treat physical health issues. Those, we have a great understanding of, because they are grounded in physical reality. 



   Yet the less physical parts of human health, though affected, connected to our physical brains and bodies, are a completely different piece of the human being, and need to be researched and treated as such.

   I am not saying to throw out your meds; if they work to help you, and you want your symptoms to all go away, then that is great. 



   It's your life, your decision. 
But i believe that  """"schizophrenia""""  and several other disorders involving psychosis and sensory/empathy experiences/changes, are abilities and senses that science has yet to grasp an understanding of. 

   Perhaps we just aren't ready, maybe we never will be; yet we are both physical and ethereal beings. Bodies with thoughts, personalities, and dreams. And i think that demonizing those sensory experiences has caused the majority of people who experience them to view, and thus experience, them as wholly a disorder, an affliction that is solely negative. But the negative thing is in large part the way you perceive all of it: Everything has positive and negative. This is a rule of our reality, an absolute.

   For there are both perceptive and empathetic abilities, and then the price that accompanies them. 
Current medical literature just understands both of these things as the burden, when the burden is just a part of extra sensory talents. Everything has a downside, a trade off.

   I hope to one day find a witch doctor, or guru, or spiritual guide to learn from.

The true answers to the problems we experience lie in the teachings & whispers of the past, not within a pill made in some lab, sold for billions of dollars total to keep people drugged out as possible.

   I hope everyone reading this can find their own way to a meaningful, and decently happy life.",4,1

For those of you that agree, I’m going to propose some things in this post that will be a little hard to accept so I’ll back them up with bible verses.  You should pray about this.  Dont take my word for it.

1. In my opinion what is happening from a religious perspective is the return of Christ in our lives.  Christ is God now so he is no longer a person.  When he returns he returns as more of a presence.  Christ’s return is not a pleasant thing for sinners:  In Luke 12:35 in which ‘Jesus warns about the coming division’ we see that his return will cause contention.  “I have come to bring a fire on the earth, and how i wish it were already kindled!  But i have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!  Do you think i came to bring peace on earth?  No, I tell you but division.
2. Christ returns to different people at different times.   When talking about his return in Luke starting at 12:35 he describes the need to be vigilant and ‘like servants waiting for their master’ because he may return to us at any time\- it will be unexpected ‘like a thief in the night’.  He then describes consequences that we may face if we are found to be sinful “Suppose that servant servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants both men and woman and to eat and drink and get drunk.   The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.  He will cut him into pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers” \(or “...assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth” in Matthew 24:51.\)   Jesus gives a warning of a terrible fate in Luke 17:2 when “Jesus said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come! It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.    He doesn’t always find us lacking.  Some people he helps and blesses.  I was working as a volunteer caregiver and had an older client who couldn’t seem to remember where she put things in her home.  She was living alone and told me she watched church on tv every day \(she couldn't drive\) and that she couldn’t really remember ever sinning.  She said that whenever she cant remember where something is in the kitchen, Jesus would remind her by putting the idea in her head of where it was.  I thought to myself that Jesus was in my head too but he’s not so happy with me.  For some of us his return may be somewhere in between on the spectrum.
3. Likewise, from what I can tell, Jesus returns to those in 12 step programs like AA to a varying degree.  He directs their thoughts helping them to get sober.  After relapse peoples thoughts get especially erratic in those groups.  Again it is not always a pleasant experience.
4. Christ is harder on some people than others according to their knowledge of right and wrong. “The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows” but the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows.  From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted much, much will be asked.”  Luke 12:47
5. Christ has sentenced us to hell and is waiting for us to repent.  I dont believe he intends us to die in hell.  ""Jesus came into the world to save sinners"" Timothy 1:15.  He wants us to make amends for what we’ve done, work on ourselves morally, and improve our character defects.  According to scripture he enters hell and preaches to us.  So he is here with us. The reason i suggest this is that some of the voices acting as agents of God challenged me to do the right thing with respect to some of my wrongs.  My wrongs were criminal and could mean jail time but i complied anyway. As i continued to comply over the past year or two my symptoms have greatly improved but i had to put myself at great personal risk to complete my amends.   I believe these agents were giving me my tidings of redemption.  If you havent received any help around how to achieve your redemption \(and get out of hell\) ask about it in prayer.  In my case my redemption was through working the 12 steps.  As stated in AA, the payoff for completing amends is a return of serenity.  It seems to be working that way for me.
6. If Jesus asks you to repent.  Do it.  Jesus has performed miracles for me to convince me of who he is.  In the bible when he performed miracles in towns he visited he expected them to repent in response.  “Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent. ‘Woe to you, Chorazin!  Woe to you Bethsaida!  For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes...it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgement than for you”  Matthew 11:21.

If this is true i know it can strain our relationship with Jesus.  If you’re having trouble with God and Jesus, I encourage you to pray to the Virgin Mary for mercy as she is a proponent of us sinners.  Another thing i recommend is volunteering.  Matthew 25:31\-46 suggests we will be judged based on how we treat the least among us.  Working at homeless shelters always makes me feel good.  Volunteer caregiving, volunteer tutoring, animal shelters, special olympics, all could use your help as well.  You can even try to volunteer in areas that overlap with the areas in which you owe amends.  Some people even change their career as a ‘living amend’ to be more service oriented.

Note:  Sometimes amends can get really intense.  If you’re trying to make amends and the pressure is too much for you and you become suicidal please don’t.  Your soul won’t rest if you kill yourself.  Go to the ER and tell them your suicidal and let them admit you for a few days and rest.

Please add anything you see in the Gospels or any of your thoughts that may support this interpretation of our situation.  Or if it makes no sense to you let me know that too.",2,1

my last meeting with my therapist, one of the things we talked about is how i definitely don't have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. this in comparison to a talk with my psychiatrist about the my symptoms, and how it sounded like i could possibly have schizoaffective. This, plus some very good online resources, mainly from the Living Well With Schizophrenia youtube channel, gave me some possible insight and comfort on what I had experienced a few months ago (seeing people in distance, hearing muffled conversations in other rooms, increased sleep paralysis to list some things.) with these things in mind, i really was considering the possibility of a schizophrenia related illness.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice and/or do's and don'ts. I'm planning on writing them with disorganized schizophrenia, and I've done research on it, but I want to hear from people with it; but I also *do* want to hear from anyone with schizophrenia in general.

They also have a dissociative disorder like DID (OSDD) and I've heard that some symptoms of dissociative disorders and schizophrenia overlap, (such as hearing voices)---I have a good understanding of OSDD because I have it, but I also want a good understanding of schizophrenia.

Any advice will help! Thanks!

*Thank you to everyone who has helped!

I've came to the realization that I should probably post some bullet points that I've written before from listening to people talk about their schizophrenia:

""Some people see schizophrenic hallucinations like patterns in their vision; or patterns of faces.

For some, the voices giggle, scream, or cheer.

Some people can draw out the hallucinations they see.

Some people also see the voices and hallucinations and/or delusions as a different entity.

Voices, good or bad, may have deeper meanings about your own feelings. Such as a voice telling you not to go outside=you feel unsafe/uncomfortable going outside. 

You can set boundaries, interrupt, and calm the voices. You can work together and function together.

Hallucinations, voices, and delusions can take the place of your pain and voice it.""


I also do study psychology---in college and on my own---and I even experience delusions and hallucinations myself, though, they may not be on the same level as someone with schizophrenia---I think they may just stem from anxiety, I don't quite know.",29,1

1961,629dn0,Has schizophrenia decreased your vibrational energy level?,"I've experienced dramatic changes to my vibrational energy since being diagnosed. I believe we're all energy forms, and my energy form has been transformed and degraded tremendously.

This manifests in some different ways. To begin with, I just -feel- like a lower energy form: I'm less positive; my energy is soggier, dull, and blunt instead of sharp, crisp, and fine; and instead of being bright in color, I'm dim.

Another aspect is, because I'm a lower vibrational energy, I perceive the world very differently. I used to feel differentiated energies coming from people and places, but now I don't - I'm too low vibrational to sense such things anymore. I also no longer feel amazing joy; that emotion has become outside my energetic range. In general, the world used to be full of energies (some of them awesome), but now I'm blind to most of them.

There are some other changes too. 

Anyway, it's hard for me to explain what a shift in ""vibrational energy"" is, but I think you know it if you've experienced it.

Has schizophrenia caused a decrease in your vibrational energy? What was it like for you? How would you describe it? (I'm curious if it's similar to my experience.)",5,1
1966,1385o5j,Finally found some sites that say our brains produce extremely low frequencies (ELF),"https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/129376/484_2020_1864_ReferencePDF.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

And another link..

https://www.measurement.sk/2005/S2/Lipkova.pdf

It’s difficult to find sites on google that will mention our brain producing ELF. It’s always EEG… the little hat with diodes, that detects brainwaves, and is required because “brainwaves are weak” and the skull makes them weaker.

ELF is in the 1Hz to 300Hz range… has 1000km to 100,000km wavelengths… travels at the speed of light… goes through water, and the planet…

Our brains produce 0.5Hz to 30Hz upwards… which is definitely in the ELF range, and these sites confirm it.

My theory is that there are too many signals in the extremely low hertz range, and it’s super scrambled, therefore sometimes telepathy is scrambled, remote viewing is scrambled, and of course a hat would be better for direct brain signal reading.

Not only are humans producing these ELF signals… but other animals, submarine radio, power lines, the planet, and the ionosphere are producing or reflecting them… 

So do you think ELF could be the voices?

I also recently posted a patent held by a defence contractor for a device that probes and detects brainwaves… 

It’s all super interesting stuff… I’m not sure how doctors can just say it’s hallucinations… has there even been any real studies done on schizophrenics and EMFs? Not to mention the people saying our brains have a quantum field… I’m sure doctors are just saying stuff to chill us out because they don’t know… If a doctor told us “yes we can detect brainwaves remotely”, or “brainwaves travel far”, it probably wouldn’t help some people.

1976,zqjler,Am I developing early Psychosis/Schizophrenia?,"Hello, people of Reddit, I am a 22-year-old male who is on the Autism Spectrum. Over the past few weeks, there are several things that have been bothering me and the state of my mental health. After withdrawing from Seroquel over the last 3 weeks, I have been noticing that my anxiety and paranoia symptoms have become much more rampant than usual, which has made me question everything involving my mental state. These range from paranoia, constant anxiety, dizziness in public, and worst of all, insomnia and rapid heartbeat when trying to fall asleep. This has led me to be on edge for several weeks in constant fear that I am developing some form of psychosis. While I continue to take sodium valproate for anxiety and treating autism, I find that I am constantly zoning out in public and fear that an auditory/visual hallucination is on the way.

Apart from these symptoms, another important thing to know is that I have finally quit smoking weed after 4 weeks, after which I was a regular smoker for the past 2 years. This, along with chronic alcohol abuse has brought fear in my psychiatrist suggesting that I am experiencing early symptoms of psychosis. However, this becomes questionable as I have received three other opinions which link these symptoms back to my antipsychotic withdrawal and suggest that it's only depersonalization. 

To the schizophrenics of Reddit, did these symptoms sound familiar before your first onset of psychosis? I am unsure what to believe at the moment as I have received numerous opinions from health professionals that range from different diagnoses. My biggest fear is that I have abused my brain to the point of developing the disorder.",0,1

1978,z7vimg,Hello you guys :),"Im just gonna say it right off the bat, Im not diagnosed with schizophrenia. Im only currently diagnosed with ocd. However, Im wondering if theres a connection between the 2? When I visited a psychiatrist abroad and got diagnosed with suicidal OCD on the spot, she perscribed me flouxetine, as well as an anti-psychotic. Im still not entirely sure why until now. Second of all, I went to another psychiatrist the other night for a general check up. We agreed I was improving, however he started asking me questions.

-Have you seen or heard things noone else saw or heard?

-Do you think and obsess about things that other people may describe odd, or even insane? 

I was caught offguard because ever since my first visit to him, he has never mentioned or even implyed anything except OCD. 

Im not sure if this helps anyone to understand my current state, but here goes. 


In april of this year, I started getting a strange obsession with thinking about suicide. I was afraid of these, and I thought I might kill myself at any given moment even though i didnt want to. I kept visualising my dead corpse, and though quite frightening in the beggining, I really dont care anymore. These also came with reoccuring urges to commit. After a particularly close incident with a knife, my mother took me to a psychiatrist. 3 sentences from me later, I was diagnosed with ocd and, again, perscribed flouxetine and antipsychotics. I finished my antipsychotics a month into treatment, and since then i havent taken any antipsychotics. I then visited another psychiatrist, who confirmed my diagnosis and perscribed me another brand of flouxetine. To which i stayed on for the next couple of months. Then it went quite downhill, to the point where I would be committing nearly twice a week. I then voluntarily got admitted to a psych ward in which my psychiatrist works. He never visited me throughout the 12 days I was there. One night, I experienced what i would assume were delusions. I stayed up the night completely convinced that if I fell asleep, my mother would die. I fell asleep anyway and was comletely terrified the next morning. I didnt think of it much then, but now i find it strange. At some point (inconviently on my birthday) I experienced a second episode. This time around, I was entirely convinced that my whole life was a massive hallucination and that Im not real and neither is the world. I still feel that way most days. Anyway this wasnt supposed to be a rant slash life story Im so sorry💀",2,1

So when it all started I began to see things darting back and forth in a certain open area of my apartment, they did this about three times. I shrugged this off because its common to see things in your peripheral, no big deal.

As I was at work in a hospital core, I was in a corner hunched over taking inventory of things on a cart, out the corner of my eye I saw legs that were definitely wearing green scrubs, no big deal I thought it was just a Nurse making standing there checking her phone or something. But then way too much time passed, I was listening to YouTube videos and a good fifteen minutes would have passed by then and she was still there just standing. So I got a bit uncomfortable because why was she still there? Was she waiting for me to move? So I looked up to see what the deal was and there was absolutely NO one there.

Or a time I was walking through a city area to get to a cookie spot, I was walking passed this brick wall and all of a sudden a lump popped up and starting following me at a rapid speed-- think a dog under a blanket thrashing around trying to figure out where the edge of the blanket is to get out. That's the one that scared me enough to start asking questions. 

My first auditory experience was while I was in an airport bathroom, the wall or maybe something IN the wall started to mutter, it was a deep mans voice, I'm a woman so it was definitely weird hearing a mans voice in the ladies bathroom stall.
 Then maybe a month or two after that I was sitting on the couch, standard three cushion with my dog in the space beside me, all of a sudden a womans voice came out of nowhere and she started whispering in my ear, it was way too fast so I didn't know what she was saying but it made me incredibly uncomfortable because I could FEEL her leaning close to me, I think the most upsetting part is my mind placed this woman in the third empty space on the couch so she had to have LEANED over my dog to whisper at me? I don't know why that upset me LOL.

The first time I actually HEARD loud and clear what one of these voices was trying to tell me is when I was dead asleep one night, and a man, seemingly hovering above me SHOUTED at me to wake up because it was 3 am. Why did I need to be up at 3 am I don't know but I sure did wake my ass up. 

I've spoken to my therapist about this and he recommended I go in for a psych eval. I guess I've been dragging my feet because I'm afraid of how much everything will cost but eventually I will go ahead and make that call.

Hello 

I am diagnosed Schizoaffective, and have a ""Delusion"" of having come into contact with an Unknown Entity that is exactly to a T what the above poster has experienced.

The same synchronicities, predictions and other phenomena.

I'm not here for medical advice, I already see a psychiatrist. I'm here for your input into what this entity could be (if it exists at all).

Just like the above post, other people can see what this entity shows me (though they don't always understand the context as it pertains to me.) So i know these aren't hallucinations (although Psychiatry would probably classify these synchronicities as mere ideas of reference but they seem way too striking and frequent to just be coincidence or delusions of reference.

Just like the above post, this entity is malevolent, and finds humor and fun in tormenting me.

I want to hear your perspectives on this, and if you have experienced this phenomenon yourself, please share your experience and insights.

Skeptics are also welcome.

Edit: I also experience the body tremors and other physical symptoms caused by this entity

3030,euezlr,"I used my schizophrenia emergency card last night, and it got me out of a lot of trouble!","So, I don't know why, but I know I was behaving very oddly walking around my apartment complex. I got lost in my own complex. A police officer showed up, I guess someone called him because of me, and started asking me a bunch of questions. I was in psychosis but he may have thought something else was wrong. So he wants me to take him to my apartment.

I go in, I'm soooo out of it, but this is where it really saves my ass. I didn't realize it, but I walked into the wrong fucking apartment. It took me and even the officer a few minutes to figure out what was wrong. I was 2 buildings down from my apartment. Nobody was there even though I heard people in their rooms. The police officer figures this out and immediate starts asking ""how much did you have to drink today?"" and I somehow remembered my schizophrenia medical alert card that I ordered when it got popular on this sub a few weeks ago. I handed it to him and he made a face like ""uhh what's this?"" but as soon as he saw it was a med ID his whole demeanor automatically changed. He became a lot more relaxed and understanding. He just said ""come on, lets get you home"" and walked with me and made sure I got home safely.

I'm so thankful for this card, this interaction could have been SO much worse.

I highly recommend getting one! I never thought it would actually help me so much!

Hugs!!

If you're not familiar, r/ShowerOrange is simple. Eat an orange in the shower... but you have to eat it like an apple, no wedges. (Yes, peel it first) I've been intrigued for a while but I tried it on a whim because it was time.

It helped me because I have problems getting in, the temperature chance, the liquid, it's a lot of stimulus. But the orange became my only concern, and it helped to have a fun distraction while my body was acclimating. Oranges are a strong aromatic too, giving the whole thing a spa type smell even with my disabled sniffer. It was actually pretty great.",405,1

You may not be able to tell, but under my clothes are strategically placed scars, the blade scores my skin in places you will never see. You percieve the way I dress as modesty.

I don't shower or change for a week on end. And when I leave the house, my significant other often has to tell me I am wearing something inside out or backwards. Sometimes it takes me a couple of tries, and you see only the end result.

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, but when in mixed company, I will take excessive trips to the bathroom, just for a moment of silence, because things are a bit too loud. You see someone with an over-active bladder. 

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, because the whole world would fear me if I did. And when I DO act out of character, because my mask has become too heavy, you are shocked. You perceive this as selfishness, toxicity, or childlike. 

I don't look like I have schizophrenia, but, my friend, you are not looking close enough.",366,1

It can severely impact our lives and often requires a lot of treatment and strong medication.

3359,hx0x0r,My brother with schizophrenia jumped in front of a car going 60+ miles last Saturday. I watched him die in the ICU alone with me.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I knew he was schizophrenic and tried to tell my family long before he was diagnosed. They didn’t believe me. Even after he was diagnosed they didn’t buy it. Of course they tried to help, but they were treating it like someone going through a phase or like something that was temporary. 

I came here 6-ish months ago looking for help. You all gave me wonderful advice but it was me against my family and they wouldn’t listen. 

It just got too bad. He was too far gone. My family keeps telling me “there was nothing we could do” and that virtually all people with schizophrenia live terrible lives until they die alone (of course they finally admitted it was schizophrenia after he died). But I know that isn’t true because I see many of you on here trying and succeeding— people with this illness CAN be helped. I don’t have the heart to verbally disagree with them because the lie helps them sleep at night.

Edit: forgot to mention he was also schizoaffective.

Edit: not sure where I gave the impression that my family didn’t care about him. They tried very very hard. They were just treating it as if it were a phase or a personality problem. If someone is severely schizophrenic they need more help than the ‘average’ person with common emotional issues.

Edit: can people stop blaming my family please",274,1

My question - For those that have Schizophrenia, if you were having some sort of breakdown or Schizophrenic episode (I don't know the proper terminology, bear with me) how can a police officer help you/not make things worse if they end up getting called to handle the situation?  

Im being genuine here. I want to help work towards a better future for us, and a big part of that is understanding different mental states. So let's talk!

They say “mental illness is not an excuse to act like this” which I totally get but it is a good explanation which deserves compassion. I also see “we’ll Im mentally I’ll and I don’t act like this” why are you comparing your high functioning anxiety to schizophrenia??? I’m happy in a way that these people can’t even come close to imagining what a bad psychotic break is like but damn. It’s all “mental health matters” until it comes to serious illnesses like schizophrenia I guess.,249,1

further, 99% of the time its the most random bullshit that has nothing to do with schizophrenia. i saw someone ask if fucking eye floaters were hallucinations. one google search and you'd know you have an astigmatism. an. astigmatism. bad eyesight. be fucking for real.

Just because you don’t know what happens after death doesn’t mean you should take the chance. You will never see your family again if you do that because people in caskets can’t see their family. You can’t read minds. No one can. So how can you be reading your teacher’s negative thoughts about you? It’s not happening. You cannot see the future. It’s impossible. Otherwise how have we not been able to predict earthquakes or cancer cures? You are not the only person convinced they are experiencing the apocalypse or the return of god. This does not make those delusions true. You are sick. Just like someone with pneumonia. You are gonna make it. I am not trying to tell you what your experience is. This is mine.

3740,jon52w,There isn’t just a stigma surrounding schizophrenia and related conditions. There is a stigma surrounding psychiatry.,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

The schizo stigma gets talked about a lot. I do not see many people addressing the stigma surrounding psychiatry. 

There is an entire subreddit devoted to it. The members do not seem to realize that what they really are is anti modern medicine. There isn’t a single criticism of psychiatric treatment that could not be said of other specialties. 

If you’ve been in the mental health system for a while, you’ve probably heard all of the criticism. 

1. They don’t know how the medication works
2. The medication doesn’t work
3. The medication has bad, sometimes permanent side effects. 
4. Hospitals are prisons that take away your basic human rights. 
5. Some of the medications are very addictive. 
6. Psychiatrists are just guessing, they don’t really know what’s wrong with you. 
7. This list could go on and on. 

Every one of these weak criticisms could be said of all fields of medicine. Only psychiatry deals with the bad rap. 

Let’s start from the top. 

1. “Method of action unknown” is said of a great many meds. We don’t know how anesthesia works. We use it every day and it clearly works, however it works. It can also cause delirium and worsen dementia in the elderly. 

2. Most of the clinical trials performed for antipsychotics show 80% of patients reporting a reduction or elimination of symptoms. Plenty of other medications do not work for everyone. There are people that have had surgery that swear gabapentin totally relieves their pain. Other patients say it’s like taking sugar pills. They need a different stronger medication(with worse side effects)

3. Speaking of side effects, you’d be hard pressed to find a medication that doesn’t have any. Listen to any drug commercial if you don’t believe me. It’s a cost/benefit analysis. If you have crazy high cholesterol, you may take statins. They help lower cholesterol but they give you liver problems. You take the statins because you fear a heart attack over liver disease. It’s the same reason we take “zombie pills” to relieve the torture of hallucinations. 

4. While not all hospitals are exactly like a secured psychiatric facility, no hospital is fun. Also, if your condition is bad enough, a regular hospital won’t allow you to leave either. Armed security will make you stay. They’re every bit as much of a “prison”. Oh, and you don’t need to be in a mental hospital to get sedated if you act up. 

5. Many medications have the potential for addiction. Opioids get a bad rap these days, but even drugs like lyrica can be abused. You can get addicted to DXM cough syrup. 

6. There’s no such thing as doctor House and his team. They don’t run test after test until they learn your condition and cure you with a pill. I went to the ER covered in red bumps. The doctor said I had “non specific viral rash”. My second opinion said that it was obviously mononucleosis. The test was negative but the doctor said it didn’t matter. 

In summation. Psychiatry works like all other medicine. We must fight the stigma of psychiatry before we can win the fight of ending the stigma of schizophrenia. If you believe that something can go wrong with your heart, which is nothing more than a pump, then you must believe that something can go wrong with the most complicated organ in your body. 

Some quotes from my doctor: 

“there is no distinction between a physical and mental illness. The two aren’t separate.” 

“Ultimately, whatever causes mental health issues is a physical thing”

“It’s not mental health. It’s just health”

TL;DR: anti psychiatry is BS that is actually anti medicine.",204,1

I much rather have hallucinations than fearing that people can read my thoughts or that my friends all hate me or that I'm being punished in the afterlife. It's so much to deal with and I hate it.",195,1

3846,opcb4g,“Schizophrenia will ruin your life”,"When I first got diagnosed in a hospital  I thought of it as a death sentence. I was 18(20 now) and I knew it was progressive. I thought about the horror stories of losing my family and becoming homeless or having to take meds that’ll make me fat and lay in bed wanting to die all day. And the more I thought like that, the more it became true. 

But I can say now that I’m doing really well. I got on abilify and for whatever reason it works better than Zyprexa. I have a job, a place to sleep, I call my family every day to wish them a good day and to show them that I’m in a good place mentally. I’ve begun programming and working on projects. I have friends, I no longer abuse drugs, etc. 

Sometimes though I do still experience psychosis and even at work. But to me it’s nothing to be scared of. It’s like back pain. Some people experience it temporarily while other people it’s an everyday struggle. Schizophrenia to me is my form of back pain. And now that I’ve learned more about the illness and my specific delusions that come up I can dismiss it and move on with my day. The voices can be scary but when they happen(99% after I get off work). I take a nice warm shower. Lay in bed, and take a sleeping pill and pass out. 

This illness CAN ruin your life, but I won’t let it happen to me. I’ve reached out for help from god, doctors, and my family. I want to help people who are not as fortunate to have those resources. Because even though there’s not a cure there is hope to live a happy life",193,1

3881,ldan6n,Most so-called mental illness advocates have no idea what mental health help is in the US.,"You hear it all of the time from so-called progressives. “That homeless person needs mental health help” or “that criminal doesn’t belong in prison, they need mental health treatment”

While those statements may be true, the majority of these people have no clue what the mental healthcare system is in the United States. 

It is, at best, outpatient treatment where you get prescribed medication that, while it treats your symptoms, makes you feel awful. It is, at worst, a prison-like hospital where you stay indefinitely until you tell a doctor “I’m fine” enough times until a doctor or judge allows you to leave, sometimes with court ordered injections. 

Again, mental health treatment is what many homeless and “criminals” need, but the vast majority of so-called mental illness advocates haven’t the slightest idea of what they’re condemning people to when they suggest mental health help. 

What advocates need to focus on is improving the quality of the mental healthcare system. There needs to be a much heavier focus on talk therapy and much less 10 minute sessions with a doctor that prescribes you a random antipsychotic and sees you again in 2 months. 

Mental hospitals need to look more like a hotel than a prison. They need to be places of comfort. They need to be places that the mentally ill aren’t afraid to go to(and most people that have been to psych hospitals are). 

In summation, I think that the people who have a “help is out there” attitude need to realize that, in many cases, help is not out there. That needs to change. 

We need a mental healthcare system that is something to be desired, not feared.",191,1

3961,9clec2,I think this should be a safe space again.,"I used to love browsing this subreddit. Part as to why that was is because I considered this place to be a safe space. People here could talk about their delusions, free of worry, while simultaneously not worrying about their delusions being affirmed/reinforced. I feel that's changed. 

Lately, every time I jump on this subreddit, just to see what's up, I find a lot of delusional posts, which is completely okay mind you - that's something we're all dealing with. But then in the replies people often, if not always (depending on the self-post itself,) affirm those delusions. That is absolutely wrong and shouldn't be happening. I understand that schizophrenia is super difficult, I'm going through it myself. But we need to be voices of reason in order to improve each other and be better, healthier individuals. It's okay to be delusional, but as stated in the literal rules of this sub, it's not okay to reinforce delusions. That's been happening too often lately. 

I vividly remember posting about a year and a half ago that I may believe my schizophrenia was a gift. I stayed at one upvote, and got a few private messages checking up on me to see if I was okay. THAT'S what I mean. The ""voice of reason,"" aspect of this subreddit is nearly gone. it's been replaced by multiple voices practically saying that delusions are okay and reinforcing them. I don't think that's cool, at all. 

We need to be better. Let's try to improve upon ourselves. If you see the world from a factual standpoint, share your opinion, it's really needed.

I'm probably being a bummer, but I really felt the need to share this. I find zero pleasure from this subreddit nowadays other than the occasional post, and I didn't quite understand why until now. ",183,1
