2,149pkfl,What are your telltale signs you’re going into a (hypo)manic episode?,I noticed today that I kept randomly laughing at stuff that isn’t that funny and that I’ve been singing and dancing more and more as the day progresses.

3,149odnt,How do you cope when you go from manic to depressed overnight?,I have been manic for two weeks and then yesterday I just fell off which isn't too surprising as I always get depressed after I've been manic.

I feel generally blah and apathetic and I don't want to do anything.  I know I should practice opposite action but I just have zero energy.  Any coping mechanisms?,15,0
4,1497cwy,Quit my job last week during an episode. Regretting it now.,"School teacher. Love my class, but I have a couple who have ‘the most extreme behaviour I have ever seen in 20 years’ according to my current acting principal. 

Took a week off for my mental health because I felt a manic state coming on after a particularly stressful week. At the beginning of the week I honestly felt like I never wanted to go back because I was mentally stuck and I let my (acting) principal know this. The last thing I needed to do was be forced to make a decision.

Against any sort of protocol (the union is now furious with him) my principal forced me to make a decision in the middle of my unpaid leave, that I took for mental health reasons, off school campus, in my the middle of a manic episode.

Really regretting my decision. Love my students and have been crying all week because they don’t want me to leave. I have a desk full of cards from them. They just announced my resignation to all the other staff, parents and students at the school and I don’t want to leave. I have no fucking idea what to do now.

Edit: talking to the union would be a good option but I’ve only been working for 6 months and am not part of the union yet.",137,0

6,149iwv3,How did you learn to accept your diagnosis?,"Because I feel like I cannot and I’ve been researching extensively and obsessing to find any other reason that could explain my behavior and comin up dry…

I’m going through my last 12 years of life (I’m 29) and realizing that my “infinite energy” isn’t really my baseline mood because i inevitably crash… my version mania or hypomania ticks literally every single box (completely wreckless behavior, traveling all over the world never stopping, oversharing, prostitution, excessive drug and alcohol use, spending sprees on stuff for my sister, talking over people, hyper sexuality, feeling euphoric etc etc…) besides hallucination and hospitalization, even though I can check all of these boxes without a doubt in my mind I’m still convinced I’m making this all up and I’m losing sleep over this diagnosis. 

I’m rummaging all corners of the internet to see what other people’s experiences with mania is because I’m just the type of person that cannot take anything at face value, and since there is no difinitive test for bipolar disorder my nerves are just shot looking for answers. They tell me I have bipolar 2 but I feel way more mania than depression and it feels like it’s been constant since I started my antidepressant 4 years ago (lessening since I quit drinking and drugs) Thank you in advance.

Edit: I was diagnosed officially (for the 4th time) with Bipolar 2, PTSD and PMDD last Wednesday and have been kind of feeling weird about it since then",20,0

I was told that being zapped of your energy is actually a very typical symptom of bipolar and sometimes it can mimic sleep disorders.

The worst part about it is I only started feeling this way after my mom got diagnosed with a terminal disease. Before this I would say I was someone that had excellent energy and pizzazz. And now I feel like I'm permanently stuck in the exhausted mode. It makes life so hard!

17,149ry8z,First time posting-here we go,"Hi there-so, I don't really know where to begin or what to say, but I'll just start off with my diagnoses; type 2 bipolar disorder/ptsd/adhd/anxiety/asperger's and a couple of others, but am unsure if I'm wanting to share those (for now, at least). 

Long story short-I'd left an abusive situation a little over a year ago from a controlling narcissist who didn't believe treatment would help and immediately blocked them, to entering the healthiest relationship I've ever had in my life (a month and a half after that) with my supportive boyfriend who was my best friend a couple of years before. As well as extremely supportive family/close friends.

On top of the medications I've been taking (only for a few months), I consume Delta 9 THC which has helped me calm down from hypomania. This doesn't work for everyone and I'm definitely not saying to consume it if you're not comfortable-but this is just how it works for me. 

&#x200B;

Also-I want to throw this out there and see if there's any similarities with anyone else, but my boyfriend AND my best friend have told me these when I've been entering hypomania;

\- twitchy hands (when standing still)

\- fidgeting in place / erratic behavior 

\- pacing the same path (without change in pattern or speed) 

\- incredibly fast heart-rate (my boyfriend was holding me and said that it felt like my heart was racing out of my chest)

I want to hear success stories from people who came off their meds and have been stable, but I also want to hear from people who didn't have such a good time coming off their meds. Are we really doomed for a life of taking medication?

20,149i8qb,Feeling hopeless due to no job prospects,Hey all. I’ve been trying to feel better since I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 but it’s really hard to without a job and income. I quit a really good job at the beginning of my manic episode and haven’t been able to find one since. I have a college degree and can’t even find a retail job to hire me. I worked a serving job for like a week but it took more of a toll on my mental health and I felt degraded. This has caused me to be very depressed and suicidal. I only get interviews but no job offers. I’m halfway through the month and rent will be due soon. The only reason I’ve been able to get by is because of my mom and boyfriend. I feel like a financial burden to everyone. I’m in debt and the bills keep piling. I’ve been on serequol and abilify. Those haven’t worked. I just got switched to lamitical but I’m tired of not feeling ok. I’m tired of being broke. The cost of living is too high. I can’t afford anything.

I enjoy my booze a litte too much. I've gotten locked up to a hospital bed against my will. Been delusional, paranoid, angry. 

But I hide it so well most of the time. I deny it all too often. I fake it just so I can have a somewhat regular life. I trick myself into believing it's not real.

I use Daylio too and have the habit of writing down whatever I am thinking for the day since I have trouble remembering specifics from day to day. This time when I came down from mania I know I had my usual urge to run away but when I looked back at my journal entries I had fully developed plans for leaving to stay at my grandparents old place (now abandoned) and how to get a flight to the netherlands and get to japan from there. This really worried me, and I tried to convey this to my husband. He just kind of brushed it off. He’s the one who usually keeps an eye on me during those episodes.

32,149flim,Mania has been getting embarrassing,"Gotta vent but my brain is in tangent mode so sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’ve been fluctuating in a hypomanic-manic state for a couple of months now but I’ve been able to mostly keep things ok until the last month. I’ve definitely been fueling it and I know that but I’m just so afraid of the crash and I want to prolong that coming as long as I can. Drinking has been a big part of the fueling. I do embarrassing shit all the time when I’m in these episodes but last night I was told about something I had done and I feel nauseous over it. I’ve been seeing this guy, who I’m not even sure I should be seeing. He’s a regular at the bar I work at and I don’t ever go out with coworkers or customers like I don’t like to fuck with my money but here we are I decided to go out with him anyways this time. We’ve hung out a handful of times over the last couple weeks and the second time, I went to his place, we drank and had sex and I slept there then went home, just like the first time. But in the morning everything just felt off and I just didn’t feel super comfortable pursuing this and I kind of just decided to be apathetic about it and only go back over if he really pushed for it and if I was wanting the attention. Sounds shitty cause it is. Idc at this point. So I didn’t really talk to him for a few days and then he came into my work the next week and things felt ok again so I went over there after work and things seemed normal. So I proceeded like that one morning was just a fluke. Last night when we were hanging out he said something about “ it just kind of threw me off when you were laying in my kitchen alone” and I’m like tf are you talking about? And he was genuinely shocked that I didn’t remember. As he explained, suddenly the experience came back to me and I’m about to cringe typing it out. That second time I came over and things felt off the next day was because I had a fuckin panic attack and then my brain blocked it out ?? That night after we had sex, he went into the bathroom and while he was in there I began to have a panic attack (also I hadn’t had sex in over a year before hooking up with him due to trauma that isn’t fully resolved, clearly lol) so I went into the kitchen I guess idk what my thinking was. He said he came out and I was like nearly fetal position rocking and I was saying that I needed to leave but I was way drunk so he didn’t want me to drive. he coaxed me out of it and got me to go to bed eventually but OH MY GOD that shit is so embarrassing. I’m lowkey wondering what’s wrong with him that he’s still interested in me when that was the second time we ever hung out but like UGH this is the stuff that makes me not mix work with all of that now every time him and his friends come into my job I’ll know that they all know how unstable I am.

Money issues and stresses are on my mind literally constantly and I just feel like I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do, because I put myself in this situation. 
I feel like if therapy and meds were helping I shouldn’t have had a manic episode and spent so much. And when I do have issues I shouldn’t be having break downs and self harm thoughts.

41,149l9we,Is it mania or do I have a real problem in my relationship :/,"I am manic rn. I haven't slept in a few days. A common thing w/ mania for me is hypersexuality.

I've always been in monogamous long term relationships with friends, never been on a date or met someone outside a friend group.

I'm married. Happy to be married, can expound on that more, but my husband is very giving, sensitive, gentle, yet unfortunately suffers from low self esteem and a sense of timidness.

We haven't had sex in forever. I couldn't hope to tell you the last time we would have, like past a year at this point, and the last time would have been a 'quickie'.

When I'm not manic, I'm usually OK w/ it. I'm not 'happy' about it, but I don't think about it every day or talk about it all the time.

But when I am manic, I care soooo much. And I skip from how I think someone else might normally go 'oh this bothers me, it will build up slowly, I'll try to talk about it.' I instantly go 'well this exact same day I want to go find someone to flirt and/or sleep with'. I've never done that, even when not in a relationship, but it's like I have NO boundaries immediately.

Am I trying to blame my bipolar since I'm like whatever the rest of the time except mania, or am I using it as an excuse for not addressing it more w/ him when it's a problem regardless?

Dunno where to go from here :/ I'm in therapy and a terrible client bc my therapist says hey you need to talk about this, how did it go last week talking about this, oh you still haven't done it I can't think of another way to tell you to get over it and do it lmao",2,0

45,149pmbk,How to move on from manic behavior?,"A few months ago I had a full blown manic episode with psychosis. I was in a really good position in my life. I was dating, doing well at work, exercising regularly, and going out. But despite being medicated, I still had a bad episode.

During this episode I said some weird things. I accused some peers of things like poisoning me and said I was pregnant (awful, I know). I didn’t say this stuff directly to the people I was accusing, and the people I said this to aren’t even friends with the people I accused, so they might not even know I said this, but I still feel mortified. I know I was wrong for saying these things, but this was the first episode I’ve had with auditory hallucinations so my delusions seemed so real and I was extremely frightened.

I was episode free for almost five years, was in a different environment than which I had my last episode, and was really trying to preserve my new reputation and have a fresh start. I’m normally a really relaxed, “chill” person but now I feel like a basket case and feel seen as “crazy”.

I know everyone has moved on and I doubt anyone still thinks about my behavior, so I how can I finally move on from this?

I’m also a major perfectionist so I tend to linger/obsess on my faults. I keep comparing myself to my peers bc I also had to a take time off from work due to my episode and I feel like everyone is advancing/doing well in life besides me. Any advice is welcomed.",1,0

I was fine showing up everyday. i didn’t LOVE it (i’ll never love a job), but it was bearable. 

Until yesterday when my coworker lied directly to my managers face about me and there was nothing i could do. I tried to point out she was lying, but my manager waved it off. I was enraged.

So Ive been on 600mg of Seroquel XR for about a year now, but almost every time I take it at night and a wait a little (~1 hr) the sleepiness starts to settle in I start to get either 1) feelings of impending doom, like everything is gonna get f*cked soon or 2) how my life is a mistake after mistake, regret after regret. 

When this happens, I either go to bed and wake up feeling fine or it would last 1 or 2 hours then completely go away.

59,1492bw6,"Started meds maybe over a year ago, my mania and depressive episodes have gone, but my anxiety is still super high.","I was diagnosed roughly last year, and I have taken meds from Albilify, Lamcital , and lithium. (Don't remember exact names). I also take Concerta (ADHD meds, but they suspect I don't have ADHD)

For the most part, my mania and depressive episodes have gone. At least the emotional aspect.

I usually start manic episodes around  April and nothing even close to that has started. Just feel anxiety all the time. 

I still have a very difficult time doing regular things, like consistently keeping my house clean, working out regularly, eating properly, getting things done, etc. 

I barely do them. I have extreme anxiety before I do them, and I just can't start. And I only start when I realize that I am fucked and just start doing things during panic mode. 

So I feel like I am physically depressed while I am not emotionally depressed. My mania phase has completely gone and has not come back. I sometimes I wish I was manic, it was much better than now. 

I also feel like I don't want to get into social situations. I don't want to meet people unless I have to, and I don't even want to think about dating. When I was manic, I was dating around like crazy.

Obviously since I am not taking care of myself, I completely let myself go, I look old and ugly, and I am wearing the same shit over and over again, my hair is getting long and I am just extremely unhappy with the way I look. 

So, putting this altogether, it's giving me extreme anxiety. And therefore I am in this constant loop. 

I thought medication would help me stop behaving this way, but I still feel this aspect to be the same and in some cases worse. 

I told my doctor, and he said from a third-party point of view, he thinks I am doing well. I walk my dogs everyday for an hour or more. I am doing pretty decently at work. I ""try"" to be social by going out once in a while, etc. 

He told me that the only way I can get out of this ""slump"", as I call it, is through routine and discipline and there's like no ""meds"" that can make me motivated.

61,149aj3d,Bipolar 2 and psychosis?,"So, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 last April, and after hospitalization last month I've started a partial hospitalization program. The new therapists and clinicians I see there think I may experience psychosis, which is a totally new diagnosis for me. Admittedly I've had experiences since early adolescence that seem to fall on the psychosis spectrum: brief auditory hallucinations, intense fear that someone was in my home and I needed to hide from them (so I'd lock myself in a bathroom or closet for an hour or more), and intense, unrelenting anxiety that follows ""obsessive patterns."" When I attempted suicide, I felt almost compelled to do it, not by a voice or anything but this feeling of inevitably and ""I'm a burden and need to be punished."" Then in the hospital I had a horrifying vision, and after coming home I had the same vision and have had fear of the dark since (though it's been less than 2 weeks). I started Latuda 2 weeks ago and everyone is very confident it will help, so I think I'm posting here because I'm just confused. I thought psychotic features made you bipolar type 1 by definition?

63,149fosq,Can mania be subtle?,"Hello. I was diagnosed Bipolar at 23 years old. Didn’t want to hear it. Then shit hit the fan that year. Long story short, I had a mental breakdown. Dropped out of college. Quit my full time job. Got a studio apartment I was nowhere near ready for. Got into heavy drinking. Got into drugs. Did a lot of wild/questionable things. 
Now we are here. 
I’m 29 years old. Married. Almost 5 years clean. Pretty much sober the past 3 years with the exception of a very occasional drink. Work a full time job. Go to therapy. My life is stable, I have a lot of coping skills, and I value all of this. 

That being said, I can see how my party girl days can definitely scream mania. However, in my stable life style, sometimes I question if I’m Bipolar…I do swing from long periods of depression/anxiety to periods of feeling “normal.” Now normal to me might be what the mania is? I feel happy, productive, motivated; but I also stay up a little later (and I mean a little- like I fall asleep at midnight instead of 10pm). I get big ideas, but in my head I’m justifying them as I’m not depressed- so get everything done! Clean, catch up on alllll bills, think about vacations, look into moving finally (we want to move in the next two years). I get pretty hyper about this stuff though and my husband says I pump the gas too fast when I’m feeling this way. 

So is this depression and I’m just emerging from a depressive episode…or is it actually Bipolar and my mania is just better managed due to using my tools? 

PS- I’ve tried a couple a bipolar medications, but I was allergic to Lamictal and Depakote alone made me very depressed. 
On the same page, I had what my doctor called rapid cycling on Zoloft and Wellbutrin by themselves. 
I’m also diagnosed ADHD, C-PTSD, and OCD. Only taking Buspar at the moment. 

So my doctors probably onto something and I’m just in denial I’m sure lol.

Then came december 2022, i was having some problems like low energy, not wanting to go to work, i talked to my doctor and he asked me to raise the dosage to 200 mg. Which i did.

One day my brother and few cousins confronted me that i might be becoming bipolar, i was totally ignorant to that, another day went by, i had a massive fight with everyone at my home and left the house.
Next night i took some mdma which totally went negative and i did a lot of stupid shit. Didn’t harm myself or anyone. My 2 friends were there who handled everything till i calmed down. Now i knew i fucked up and wanted to fix things in any way possible.
A cousin was there who went to my home and told everything to my family, who got me thrown in a rehab. I was picked while i was asleep from my apartment and thrown there, i belong to pakistan and the rehab experience was very miserable it was like being in a prison. I was kept there for 2 months on God knows what medication. Their diagnosis was “drug induced mania”.

Came back home, my family doesn’t want to talk about any of it. I didn’t go for any follow ups or take the medicine that they recommended.
I wanted to get through all this myself.
But its been 3 months now that i am out of the rehab, i am trying to be strong but i know i am super depressed. My legs keep shaking when i am sitting, i cannot find peace.

While I do enjoy that 5-10% when i'm allowed to be anything more than content, it's a little egregious trying to deal with the other 90%. My whole life ive always been regarded as quiet or gentle. This has never bothered me. The real problem is the fact that more and more people I interact with seem to pick up the fact that there's SOMETHING wrong with me, even if they can't pinpoint what it is. It's like typical people have a sensor that goes off when they are in the presence of someone who doesn't fit in 100%. I don't have any real desire to be wanted or accepted by other people even, I just want them to understand me in a way that doesn't come off as unusual. I've tried approaching it logically, trying to really invest myself in my hobbies and interests, but of course those never take for more than a month or two. The only time I ever had a long sustained interest was when I was full of ritalin and fixated on weird arcane shit during the pandemic. No one wants to talk about that though. When I try to talk to people in social situations, I recieve blank stares as though I just said something obscene. What comment about the weather could I have made that confused or upset them so much? IDK maybe im just paranoid and nothings wrong with me HAHA.

85,148r52y,The guilt of my past behaviour is eating me alive.,"My ex and I were together almost 4 years. 

Last year my diagnosis changed and my psych took me off my antipsychotic and mood stabiliser. After Christmas I began to unravel, coming off lithium I had my first full blown manic psychotic episode. 

When I’m manic I’m truly horrible. I am vile, capricious, psychopathic and verbally hostile. I am truly a disgusting human being to be around. 

My psychiatrist continues to be utterly useless despite me telling them I cannot come off my medication again. The true victim of my episode has been the demise of my relationship. My ex was far from perfect and had many problems of her own, but I cannot help but feel disgusted with myself for how I treated her. I only stabilised back on an antipsychotic recently, and by that point it became too much for her and the relationship beyond repair. 

Whilst I know my ex wasn’t the innocent party I cannot help but feel disgusted and ashamed of myself for how I behaved. It doesn’t help having a psychiatrist who refuses to acknowledge that my mania and psychosis were actually bipolar related. I had issues with substances during the relationship but I tried so hard towards the end to make it right, to get clean and to rebuild our relationship. 

I refuse to point blame at my ex other than for what is reasonable. She was a true hero dealing with me and I pushed her to the edge. I miss her in some ways but the decision to end things was right. 

What I cannot get away from is who I become off meds. Finally being stable again is frightening looking back. Ex tells me my mental health was no excuse, I’m inclined to agree. Fuck me, the whole thing is like a car crash. The house is quiet and I can’t escape the knawing feeling it was my fault.",18,0

102,148nsnc,Rapid cycling is destroying me,"—Talk of self harm and wanting to give up—

I have been struggling since at least September last year. Either meds adjustments don’t do anything or they work for a short while before everything crashes and burns. 

My depression reached new levels during the last month, and now my mood has been rapid cycling so bad that I have multiple mood swings a day. I literally don’t know what to expect from one minute to the next. Although this has been going on a while today reached a new peak of rapid cycling and I am EXHAUSTED. I feel bad for my husband, I feel bad for myself. 

I have my mom staying with me so that I am not alone while my husband is at work (I have a history of SI, and the urges have surfaced so I discussed my mom staying over with my husband). 

I just want to feel something besides the confusing emotions and thoughts in my head. I want to give up, I know it would destroy my mom and husband but my current existence is no walk in the park to them either. 

It’s a long story I won’t bore you with, but my psychiatrist has been out of reach for a few weeks but we finally talked today and I will go for blood tests tomorrow and get a new prescription. 

Honestly? It’s feels pointless. A waste of time and money. I don’t know anymore…

I think I am self soothing with shopping and I have a plan for something I want.l to buy tomorrow but I don’t want to disappoint my husband. I bought something today that didn’t work as expected, but I bought it cause it was a lot cheaper than the one I really wanted. I know it was stupid but I thought it was the right choice. 

Sometimes I just want to run away but I love my husband and our pets so much. I want to run away from my thoughts and emotions, not them, if that makes sense. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this. I wrote on TrueOffMyChest a while back and only got one response. I deleted my post after a few days.

I haven’t had an easy life I was in and out of the system from birth until I was 14 with a lot of fucked up hiccups in between. I was homeless for a year and then my school help me get some help not mental help but made sure that I was fed and had supplies and stuff. I was in the McKenny-Vento program all through out highschool. Somehow I graduated but I was 20 years old. I became pregnant at 21 and it turned my life around. I did everything I could for my son. Cps was involved in my life shortly after he was born it was a pretty fucked up story and without them being involved I would have never gotten my diagnoses I swore off therapy and counseling because of the abuse I endured throughout my life with them and being forced to take medication and see them when I was younger. I don’t ever remember my diagnoses as a child but my fucked up father swore he knew I didn’t have it until guess what he told me the day after I found out he was bi polar. I struggled everyday of my life I am now 23 with mental illnesses not knowing what it was. I thought I was doing fine. I thought suicidal ideation being manic and depression episodes where normal. After everything I’ve been through which short to nothing of a life in hell I thought it was a normal response. Well anyways i found out I was bi polar in a court room last week. In front of judges and lawyers. I busted down crying it was so traumatic no one had knew that I didn’t know. I was begging for a year to receive my psych evaluation. Cps made me do three of them and I have had 6 caseworkers throughout this whole process and my case has been fucked from the start. I am still processing how to talk about it but finding out in front of a bunch of strangers who decide the fate of my son and mines life broke my heart I busted down crying uncontrollably because for years I argued with everyone who told me I had it that I was wrong.

I chose the title because I have an irrational concern that I would not last long if we are faced with hoards of the undead.  While that fear is likely unfounded, how the world is going these days doesn't inspire confidence that what we face is much better.

The approach towards mental health has changed a lot since 1998.  Seeking help back then was generally seen as attention seeking behavior.  I was ashamed to talk to friends and terrified to tell my parents.

If I wasn't trying to overcome a disturbingly low self-esteem through speed and sleeping with any guy who showed the slightest bit of interest, I was slowly increasing the depth I would cut at my wrist. (Classic attention seeking whore behavior at that time).

Around the time I was standing at 5'8"" and 114 pounds, I finally talked to my parents.  My father walked away and my mother asked if it was something they did.  Maybe asked isn't the right word, more pleaded with me to assure her it wasn't her fault.

And so I hid again.  I blamed myself for making them feel bad.  Pasted on a happy face when they were around.  Drank myself to sleep when they weren't.

Somewhere along the line, the term, ""chemical imbalance"" became all the rage.  When I tried to talk with my parents again, they had something to cling to.  It wasn't anything they did.  It was something wrong with me.  

If they could throw enough money at therapists and medication, they could convince themselves that they were ""helping"" me.  Financial help from my parents always seemed to come with a higher cost than a Vegas loan shark.

Perhaps my biggest problem at that time was a refusal to stay in therapy.  How could I talk to a stranger about a less than perfect childhood without acknowledging the role my parents played?  After all, this was a chemical imbalance so what could I possibly have to work through in therapy?

As the years went on, attempts at therapy became more and more pointless.  I didn't just hide my feelings from a therapist, I worked hard to hide them from myself.  

After a while, I started to doubt whether my memories were even true.  Did I make it all up to justify why I had so much trouble navigating the world?  

Meds got me to the point I could function enough in the world and I taught myself how to survive on that.  Isolation became solace.

A few weeks ago I ran into a major problem with my meds and have been forced to take a deeper look at myself.  

No.  Not myself.  I am fucking awesome.  I like who I have become!  I have been forced to take a deeper look at what led to my first psych visit in '98 and how it has led me to this place now.

Once again, my thoughts are based on my own experiences.  Don't ever let what anyone else says keep you from seeking help.  You are worth it.

Therapy:
I suck at therapy. I'm a conceited bitch who still believes I know more than the therapist. While this may be true for some I have met, I will admit I used the same rationale to ghost therapists who could have very muched helped.  I was too afraid to go down that road.

Meds:
I wish I had done more of my own research before taking anything.  And after many years trapped on Effexor, I wish there had been more info about long term use (obviously not possible for a newly released drug at the time).

I'm frustrated with the current state of mental health care that doesn't seem to provide a suitable amount of tests before putting people on meds.  And even if there are more tests, how many of us can actually afford them?

Once again, never let anything keep you from getting help.  If it helps keep you afloat DO IT.  Consequences be damned!

On those dark sleepless nights, when all you can do is hate everything about yourself, try to remember that there are thousands of things beyond your control that led you to this spot.

FWIW, I still haven't been able to do that for myself, but it sounds like damn good advice.",5,0

125,148k2dx,Being bipolar with extensive brain injuries,"Hello - I have been thinking a lot about this recently and wanted to see if anyone has any insight on what it’s like to be bipolar and also have had multiple head traumas. I have had 3 Major & 4 Minor concussions in my life, ranging from ages 11 - 21. (my current age) I personally feel as if it makes it harder to manage my bipolar symptoms with each head trauma. After my first three concussions, I was actually still able to be a very productive member of society. I was able to hold a job, manage my relationships, control all my manic episodes and coast pretty well through the depressive ones. However, following each of the two concussions i’ve had in the last 2 years. I have found that my symptoms seem less manageable, if not even worsened as a whole. It is not like they have been changing my meds a lot, I have been on the same dosages since January, but following my concussion in April, everything has seemed so much harder. I ended up losing my job due to taking a few days to heal from the concussion and since then have not been able to hold a job down. I was admitted to the psych ward for the first time a month ago.

127,148t845,Feeling like being under an emotional microscope,"I wanted to know if any one else feels like they are under an emotional microscope. I tend to feel like everyone can recognize my emotions and they think I’m crazy. My emotions may not have anything to do with being bipolar, nor are they out of proportion whatsoever, but I still feel judgement. They are also usually not noticeable by others unless I say something about it. There is no reason for me to believe, for the most point, people think I’m crazy. I still feel like I have to keep telling myself I’m not. When I’m in a depressive episode I feel constantly watched when I’m around others and they are plotting against me trying to make me unstable. When I’m manic, I withdraw from others too. I’m so worried that people will think I’m unreliable or not trustworthy. When I’ve had conflicts with roommates that had nothing to do with my illness, I was dismissed and nobody took responsibility for actions that were unprovoked and clearly disrespectful. They dismissed it and said I was bipolar. It’s not like I yelled at them or brought it up inappropriately. I have months of stability at least every year, but due o past experiences, I’m still worried all people think of me is crazy. 

I also feel scared and/or shameful now about telling people I have the illness because a lot of people have their own idea of what bipolar disorder is and often times it’s not a representation of my experience. For example, I haven’t had the agitation-like manias. I’m running all around the neighborhood nonstop excessively talking and laughing and having delusions and sometimes hallucinations. I can’t control my emotional reactions. Someone has told me that one of their family members died and I couldn’t stop laughing even though I didn’t find it funny. Either way, I hate telling people because I don’t like the assumptions and the way some people can come off as nice and accepting but the minute you bring up something they are doing that’s upsetting you and is disrespectful, they are quick to call you mentally ill to avoid all accountability. I worry about ever having a SO because of all the stigma, judgement, etc. It also kind of hurts seeing all the posts where people are struggling w their mentally I’ll partner. The last thing I ever want to be is a burden. I do everything I can to stay stable. I don’t drink or do drugs even caffeine. I take my meds and attend therapy actively. I hold my myself accountable for everything I can. I try to be as honest as possible. I just wish I didn’t have this illness. That’s it.

142,148i0en,Off my meds for two days and I feel TERRIBLE,"I take Latuda and Cymbalta as my main psych meds, plus gabapentin for chronic pain and Zofran for the nausea the Latuda causes. For the last five years I've taken my medications right before bed. I struggled a lot with going on and off meds when I was in my early twenties, and a ""keep it simple, stupid"" approach to taking meds at the same time every day has helped me stay consistent. It's been the stablest, in many ways the best, period of my life; I owe my life to these medications.

In the last few months I've been on and off my meds a few times. The first time wasn't really by choice - I had a month-long migraine attack and my nausea was so bad I threw up my meds several times and couldn't retake them. I noticed that on the days when I didn't have medications in my system, I was waking up much, much earlier. With the Latuda/Gabapentin/Cymbalta combo, I struggle to get out of bed before 10 a.m. Without it, I was waking up at 5:30 with my husband and dog. 

Sedation is one of those things I've just kind of gotten used to. I don't like it - it's really affected the kinds of jobs I can take, among other things - but better to be sedated than manic, right?

Well, on impulse a few days ago, I decided to try taking my meds in the morning rather than at night, to see if it would help with the sedation. But then... I didn't take my meds, because at first I liked how I was feeling. Now it's three days later and I feel fucking awful: restless, like I want to run away or blow up my life or get an awful tattoo or shave my head or cut myself etc etc. Classic signs of the mixed manic episodes I got before diagnosis. So I took my meds again this morning. I still feel awful, but I know they'll kick in eventually.

I'm on mirtazapine 7.5mg at night and Ativan 1mg split into two doses. Underneath it all I'm very depressed and have become dependent on the Ativan(thanks to the doctors who prescribed it and kept telling me to take more of it to get me out the door). I'm scared of trying any new meds due to anxiety 

I had some hypomania symptoms last summer but not as bad, I still felt in control but was having a lot of physical anxiety symptoms to the point of almost passing out. 

What on earth can I do to stop losing my mind completely? I'm not sure if this is mania or extreme anxiety/depression/dpdr",2,0

155,148cpte,Pre-diagnosed and scared,"I (35f) had an appointment yesterday with a therapist who told me I might suffer from bipolar disorder.
I have had a few depressive episodes for the past 10 years and since 2021 I have also experienced some symptoms that are consistent with the definition of mania. I have been on therapy regularly since 2020 and I have consulted a psychiatrist since 2021 who put me on quetiapine but while my therapist does not talk about a diagnose, the psychiatrist told me that these were mild mood changes and did not consist of bipolar.
The meds are okay and help me sleep, but did not prevent me from having both manic and depressive symptoms.
About 2 months ago i went to my general doctor because of a sinus infection and ended up crying in his office with a huge panick attack and opened up about how i was feeling mentally. He referred me to a therapist (both part of the national heath service - i am not in uk but in a country with a fairly good free and public health service). Yesterday i had my appointment and i mentioned a manic episode i had about 1 month ago - a burst of energy that lasted 5 days).
My final diagnose will probably come only in august when i will have an appointment with NHS psychiatrist but the therapist suggested bipolar disorder and although i feel like my intuition and symptoms are being validated, i am also scared. I am on work leave due to feeling miserable and i am worried my condition worsens and gets me in trouble. I have a wonderful, caring and understanding partner who is taking the load of caring for our house and 3 kids almost exclusively. 
I know i will get better with meds (doctor had me on sertraline as well) but i am really scared of telling my parents and friends about this. I feel like a huge failure, not living up to my full potential and just a disorganized mess. What was it like for you folks with a late diagnose and what can i do - small stuff - to make this a little easier? Thank you all so much",2,0

160,14830wo,I drew for the first time in 3 years!,"The last 3 years have been a lot for me mentally. I finished grad school, passed my board exams, had a baby, and started a new job straight out of maternity leave. I felt like I had lost all creativity and the ability to focus on anything that used to be mine. It was all about my son, my family, my job and just trying to hide the constant mixed/manic episodes. My husband would tell me that me that I’d feel so much better and less stressed if I went back to this hobby or he pleaded “any hobby”. He didn’t quite understand that every attempt I made to draw, paint, write, or anything creative was completely washed out of me because I was in constant survival mode masking my intense episodes so I could function for my family. It’s laughable to even say that, because to the outside world it might have looked like I was a very ambitious, driven and extremely productive person…those who knew me personally could see how bad the spiral was and they tried the best they could. I finally switched psychiatrists, after working together 10 years and although scary, it was the best move for me. I took a job that is structured, very positive culture, and honestly does stand by work/life balance. There’s no expectation to work outside of my contract hours plus my boss and coworkers are amazing. I found a female psychiatrist who was able to invest the time for hour long sessions rather than 15 minute med check-ins. She also has given me the acceptance and understanding that child birth really screws up a lot of us birthing people who are bipolar. I’ve always been bipolar 1 and I’ve had mixed episodes in the past. But as I was explaining to my new doctor, this has been the first time in since my son was born in which I have gone from severe ups to severe manic mixed episodes with only very brief periods of stability or depression. 

It’s been a really rough road but I feel like I’m thawing out and coming back to life. My skills may be rusty but I was able to freely draw: things I saw, things I made up, things that were silly, and things that were very just very random. I did it with relaxation. Nothing more. Just feeling calm and in the moment.

I’m proud that I’m starting to get back to me. I’m proud that I can look at some of my emotions now and not always jump to a good day is going to lead to mania, a bad day filled with anxiety and tears is going to be a mixed episode and that feeling down for a day or two is turning into a depressive episode—but rather, I’m entitled to good days, bad days, and everything in between. I used to know myself so well. My triggers, my patterns and I was 100% compliant and reliant on myself to follow my treatment plan. I was successful for almost 10 years.

It just feels better to feel ‘normal’, get back to what I love and give myself the compassion I deserve for the hell I went through.",8,0

He says he’s too fucked up and unsure of himself to be in a relationship. He has good reasons which I don’t want to get into, but he also has promised me the world and told me over and over how he didn’t want to lose me for the past year. 

I thought we would make it. I had faith. We’ve been through so much. I feel so broken - not just because I miss him, but because I’ve never had any relationship where my partner actually follows through on the things they say. Where they stick around. Where I trust them when they say they value and love me. 

I know in time things will get better, but I have been so deeply unhappy since the on and off started at the end of February. I know I deserve better but I wanted him to be better.

162,147q2uh,Cheated during a bout of serious mania. Looking for words of encouragement/advice/comments or anything.,"Hopefully everyone can hear me out before rushing to judgment. I’m severely bipolar and have been dealing with the disorder since 2010. My wife and I have been together since 2013 and married since Oct. of 2018. Before we started dating I told her about my illness and all of the symptoms that come with it, including mania and psychosis. I tend to become manic during the holidays and start to recover in this spring. This season was the worst bout of mania I’ve ever experienced. A friend of mine lives in New York and invited me up for his birthday celebration. Drinking, drugs and situations of excitement severely impact mania. My wife and I have a 14 month old, our first child together. Getting out of the house for a night in the city was incredibly exciting. The first sign of real mania was me putting my card down for a $1,400 dinner tab. The second was binge drinking. The third was buying a VIP section in the club we went to, another $5,000. I live a comfortable life but in no way do I have any business spending that much money. The last sign was when I started to take drugs. Cocaine and Molly. Things I haven’t touched for a decade. By this time I was in complete psychosis. At some point I disappeared from the group and received oral sex from someone in the club. I don’t know the person and can hardly remember it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to multiple doctors to ensure I am clean after multiple tests for STDs. The only thing that holds me back from having peace of mind is the possibility of having HPV. It’s been since January 14th and I’ve been stuck. Do I tell her and risk ruining our marriage, her ability to trust me and probably anyone else, or risk breaking up our family and seeing my son grow up with a split household? We haven’t had sex since January 14th and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to touch her again. I know it’s wrong and no matter how bad I want to I can’t bring myself to do it. She is finally starting to ask why I haven’t touched her and I lied and told her it was my meds. Is this a dark secret I keep? Do I tell her? I have to think of my family. This isn’t just a post to tell me it is ok what I did. I feel shame, worthless and like I don’t deserve them. But I feel like they need me. And I certainly need them.",47,0
163,147trqh,First IV Ketamine Treatment,"For Context: I have been diagnosed with PTSD and BP-1 Disorder. I normally do sublingual tablets under the tongue for my ketamine treatments (prescription) that I do at my house. But as the anniversary of the PTSD-related trauma is happening this week, he referred me to do an IV ketamine infusion instead. I've also done nebulizer treatments with him. 

It was a completely different experience with ketamine in the IV treatment I've never experienced before when comparing to the nebulizer treatment and the sublingual tablets. There was an anesthesiologist on staff that talked to me before, we did a 40mg infusion, which I told him I didn't want to do anymore than that since he said he a low dosage of ketamine would most likely be more intense than what i've experienced before with other treatments. He was right...but it was in a good way.

It was the first time I was ever able to 'completely' dissociate away from reality, and was able to revisit the trauma surrounding my PTSD...but while I was under that 'spell' it felt like I was in a mentally safe space to be able to go back to some intense trauma-related emotions about it. Definitely cried (not like sobbing or anything out of control) during most of the treatment infusion time, which hasn't happened with me with the nebulizer or sublingual tablet treatments. The anesthesiologist checked in on me every 5 - 10 minutes to make sure I was staying calm, and to remind me I was in a safe space and that it was okay to cry. 

It already feels like a weight has been lifted off of my chest. I've been undergoing ketamine treatments for almost two years now through my psychiatrist, and it's been helping me tremendously on my mental health journey of feeling stable and not 'spiraling'; but again, today was the first time it was IV. 

Has anyone experienced doing different types of ketamine (prescription) treatments? Did you find the IV seemed to 'work' more? 

Just wanted to share a small part of my healing journey.

164,147pfj2,Wanting to be that person I was when I was hypomanic,"When I didn't know I was bipolar, I just thought I was ADHD, I started taking Vyvanse for ADHD and experienced a fundamental and radical change in who I was as a person. Like every self doubt I ever had washed away, I had an amazing elevated mood, I could focus very well because I was doing a lot of mindfulness, and I had amazing goal directed behavior. I didn't know that I was hypomanic at the time, and I just thought the Vyvanse had fundamentally changed who I was for the better. My identity fundamentally changed from this experience, and ever since then I find myself with ocd like compulsions to be that person again. Its like my identity/personality is wrapped up in who I was during that episode, but who I actually am can't fulfill that identity.

169,147xurs,Is your brain this crazy? How to forgive and forget my past self,"Hey 


I’ve always had pretty low self esteem and my brain gets stuck in the past a lot. Like daily. My brain flashes back to the parts of me that were I was at my lowest. When my behavior was awful, cringe or plain sad I suffer from BPD, BP with major depression.  (I’ve been in therapy for 4 years & stable on meds for 2) 

My body was hit with a chronic pain disorder and it’s really awful. I couldn’t even walk for a few weeks. Somehow, I’ve made 2 dreams come true; become a full timer writer and financially support myself. 

As a disabled person it’s a miracle to be functional enough to work a full time job. another miracle that I can work remotely and that my salary is really good (unless you live in an over price city like New York. 🙋🏽‍♀️) 

Life is still hard but I’m really lucky, especially given my circumstances. 
But it’s so hard to be proud of myself and let the past go to the parts of my brain I don’t need to rewind to. I can’t emotionally connect with being proud of myself anymore. I can’t connect my gratitude for certain things to my actions. I’m grateful to have a roof over my head, but I can’t link that back to the positive ways I’m living my life. 

Yes, Life has been but there are things I’ve done that have made it harder. 

But the way every mistake I’ve made resurfaces is haunting. The scenes are more powerful than my ability to live in the moment. I want to change the way my brain operates and I don’t really know how. Affirmations and scripting has help me to have a base level amount of self respect and love. That’s pretty miraculous but I also don’t credit myself for the change, I say it happened because I refuse to be in constant pain and being disrespected by someone. 

I’ve had waves of it being easier to feel pride but it’s just until it the accomplishment become part of the mundane. 

I wonder what people without mental illnesses think about every day. 

Do they feel so overwhelmed by their thoughts?  Does speaking to people feels like a chore? 

I really want to be happy. Live in the moment, embodying the pride I should feel rather than shame.

I've always been told to be extroverted it will make you happy because humans are meant to make connections with others. 

Anytime I socialize I over share , I have 2 friends and I'm pretty sure they both hate me because 1 never responds the other just ghosts me. Said I was thinking about offing myself to 1 of them (havnt talked to this 1 friend since highschool just recently started talking and hung out 1x) I had a crush on them in highschool they are very aware of it but years after I see this person as a friend, nothing more. 

They said to go get therapy but I can't because I have no insurance, can't get a job because legally I can't drive due to double vision nor can my mom drop me off at any job because of her own job. 

I try to be social like going to a local fair we have every year but I have no friends and my mom won't go with me.

I have ADHD, Panic Disorder, BPD (I think it's autism because it doesn't happen unless I'm over stimulated) OCD, and insomnia.

Havnt seen a physician in 4 years so no telling what problems I have physically.

I forget to drink water and eat. My right kidney is in constant pain, severe migraine. I can't ask for help because my brother needs mental help and has asked for some help, I don't want to worry my mom and family because they think I'm doing so good and I'm happy. 

Truth is, I'm scared to be happy because for over 20 years , I'll be doing good in life, happy ect. Then shit hits the fan, rinse and repeat.

As little as I met her as a child around June I'm nothing but depressed and when I realize what month it is it hits different.

I’m 20 and I was diagnosed with Bipolar one about a year ago. I completely flipped out and cut off all of my family at the end of last may, and moved in with my boyfriends family. Granted, my family was terrible for my mental health, and in hindsight it seems to be the “right decision”. I was able to use mental health resources provided by my college last summer and during the fall semester because my boyfriends family was incredibly generous and helped me pay for classes. After about 6 months (December 2022) my boyfriend was kicked out for his own family issues. We moved in with my best friend at the time, and I was going through what I think was a manic episode for just under two months.  I was VERY unprepared for living on my own, and I don’t have money for insurance let alone to pay out of pocket for help, right now that is. With that being said I am completely unmedicated and never even had time to find anything that helped me. Life is getting really really hard. I was so hyper sexual and erratic It eventually led to me sending pictures and chatting online with strangers. I even made the awful mistake of flirting with a coworker way too much for someone in a committed relationship. I lost substantial amounts of money bc of spending sprees on things I most definitely shouldn’t have been buying. My boyfriend eventually found out about my unfaithfulness. We were able to talk things over and he forgives me and even understands how it happened… he’s truly my angel!! But goodness the guilt I have is unsurpassed. My self esteem was at rock bottom and I still feel so unworthy of love. Fast forward past 3-4 months of deep depression and the return of bad habits, I freaked out again. My friend who I was living with didn’t take care of her cat and would always leave the kitchen a rotting mess, and one day I got the idea to cut off my last friend. My bf and I moved out in less than a day, with no notice except for a passive aggressive note I left stating “I moved out btw <3”, ruining any chance of reconciliation. We had no where left to go, so his parents agreed to let us move back in with them two-three weeks ago. They know I am struggling and just want to help me… but I have developed some serious trust issues and im terrified to be around them alone. I was riding the high that got me into this mess up until about a week ago and I am spiraling out of control. The guilt I feel for everything I’ve done in the past year is debilitating, and I feel like I physically can’t trust anyone else to help me. I desperately need help coping with manic episode let downs, and how to overcome trust issues so that I can get the help I really do need.",5,0

I have ADHD as well and that just makes it feel impossible. I’ve been binging on fast food and soda every day. I’m indulging in my expensive hobby more than I should. I buy things whether I have the income for them or not.

My current bipolar meds really don’t seem to be helping and I haven’t had ADHD meds for months now. My most recent psychiatrist said I can’t get ADHD meds because I have to be drug-free to get prescribed them (despite already being clinically diagnosed). But how can I stop smoking weed when I am dopamine deprived? 

The first psychiatrist I had seemed to understand and diagnosed and prescribed me medication for ADHD. This made quitting weed cold turkey quite easy, but since the medication I was taking was on backorder for months, I fell right back into the cycle. So I ran out and now I cannot find the motivation to get more medication.

I think I am experiencing a mixed episode because I have felt some familiar manic irritation and have also been having a hard time doing most things. But the symptoms seem like they are mild and i cant shake my feelings of confusion. I feel like i am losing cognitive function. I seem to have barely any ability to articulate myself clearly and its so fucking frustrating because I cant explain or put my finger on why i feel the way i do. I have dealt with this numb feeling so long though that sometimes I think this is just how people are supposed to feel and I dont really have any issues. I am stuck in my head almost all minutes of the day. Constantly anxious about something going on in my life. I find no joy in ANYTHING.

197,147xtn0,Doctor thinks I'm bipolar this might be a long one,"Hello beautiful people!

As many of you, the second my doctor said anything to me, I immediately googled ""doctor thinks I'm bipolar reddit"" and ended up here. I'm gonna go ahead and apologize bc this will be a long one.

I'm a 33f, always been described as bouncy, fluffy and basically a hyper person. It's something managed and dealt with my whole life. I get extremely productive spikes and then will randomly just be an absolute goblin refusing to do even basic needs like taking a shower. 
I collect hobbies, diving into them feverishly, only to randomly lose all interest, allowing stuff to sit on a shelf never or rarely to be messed with again.
I will be the best, most attentive friend and then fall off the face of the earth.
I am incredibly spontaneous and will randomly just decided to take off for the day but at the same time panic about walking into a Lowe's because idk 🤷🏻‍♀️

These are all things I've managed. I've also had social anxiety, but it was mainly centered around new situations and would generally go away once I was actively in those moments. I found smoking the devil lettuce was also something I really only enjoyed doing by myself as it would spike my social anxiety around people.

However in Mar. 2023, I had three sicknesses back to back. Nothing major but enough to take it's toll, the last one being possible strep so I was put on amoxicillin. 

About day two into amoxicillin I was out in my garage, normal day, took a hit off a bowl (I've always been an extreme light weight so I stick to flower and maybe two hits is all I need) then went inside.

I suddenly had a massive breakdown. Extreme panic attack. Had to call my s/o to come home.

The next 2 weeks was a state of nothing but panic attacks. Constantly in the mornings. I could not escape my head. My thoughts were racing so fast that it made me feel like every second I was about to take off running. I felt absolutely out of my mind and yet paralyzed inside of it. Could not stop the panic attacks so went to my doctor. In that time I also entirely stopped smoking weed and drinking caffeine as it was proving to be a trigger. I still have not resumed either of those things.

At first she was sure it was a thyroid storm brought on by the sicknesses. However after three different blood tests, urine test and even a EKG everything came back... Fine. My thyroid was perfectly healthy. In that time she had put me on Propanol to lower my heart rate (as it was elevated when she saw me) and given Lorazepam for spikes (that stuff was wonderful at making me feel almost normal again but I avoided taking it unless absolutely necessary bc of potential for addiction) 

So she went on to give me stuff for a possible anxiety related illness. Continue Lorazepam only for spikes and wanted to start me on Lexapro (5mg as I am very small 104 pounds and previously all medications I've needed a lower dose) Lexapro was an absolute nightmare. I was back to the peak of the episode that started this whole thing. Stuck inside my head, mornings I was an absolute jittery mess on the edge of panic attack. I would have to get up 3 hours before I needed to leave the house because I'd spend 2 hrs laying in bed in an attempt to calm myself enough to just get ready for the day. Zero appetite, zero sex drive (least of my problems) extremely irritable. 

For some reason I convinced myself I was being dramatic and stuck it out for a week before I reached out to my doctor who immediately said I needed to stop taking it. 

Within 4 days things leveled back out, I still don't feel like who I was before this whole thing started. For context I was VERY happy. I had, in the passed two years, finally fell in love with.myself. I enjoyed who I was, was very confident in myself and loved life. I barely had any sort of anxiety. Now I no longer can have coffee, can smoke to relieve stress (those two really are just kind of sad not my main issues) I live with anxiety every single day. The mornings still being the worst part of it. But no longer spiraling like I was at the beginning of this or on the Lexapro. 

Once things leveled, my doctor had me answer a bunch of questions. She even said she was so surprised bc at the start of this she could of swore it was just a thyroid storm. However I never really had told her about any of my daily issues, bc before this, they really were not something that bothered me. I loved when I became wildly productive and yes it did suck when I'd suddenly lose it half way through some random project but I managed. After speaking she has stated she believes i could be bipolar and asked if id be comfortable trying medication for it. 

I have to admit, after the Lexapro I am very very apprehensive. It took me right back to when this whole ordeal started and it was terrifying. Every day felt like a month and I was physically fighting it felt like just to do basic tasks. But I also know that whatever started all this wasn't medication and could happen again. I just want to be back to the person I was before all this, if that's even possible. 

I guess I am attempting to see if my experience matches any of you here. I must admit I don't know very much about bi polar and if any of this are things you've all dealt with. I'm looking for information, I haven't given my doctor a yes or no yet. As of right now I am ""ok"" (again not who I was before all this still very low energy, higher anxiety and just not myself) but I worry about doing nothing. Any advice or insight on this absolute girthy tale is going to be VERY appreciated.

Hi everyone, I am currently awaiting a diagnostic interview this week with my therapist but her, myself, and my family think I may have Bipolar I with psychosis. I am between meds because the last one was giving me heart arrhythmia and the pharmacy won't have the new one until tomorrow so I am just sitting here trying to keep myself level-headed as the mania symptoms return. 

The thought disorganization is getting really bad and I'm growing increasingly worried about the weird delusions returning. How I am feeling physically, cognitively, or emotionally changes so quickly it's hard to feel settled. I thankfully have a great support system here with my family and therapist (my psychiatrist is kinda so-so, but whatever) so I do feel safe.  However, every step of this has been about dealing with new sensations and cognitive contortions that I would love to know what you fellow sufferers of Bipolar Disorder do to cope in the moment when the mania is overwhelming.

Basically I’ve been on two big stressful international trips the past two weeks, which my psychiatrist strongly cautioned against (not going was not an option). So I knew this would have some effect on me since travel is one of my triggers, but I have no idea what is going on right now. I was in a medium depressive episode before leaving, which has felt a bit exacerbated since beginning the trip. But after a few days I started to get very disoriented, having a hard time hearing/understanding what people are saying when they speak to me, sleeping all the time and even sleeping through my alarms which I’ve never done before. I think I had one small visual hallucination but still am not sure. This got a bit more extreme at the worst possible time when I was going through an airport to get to the second part of my trip. I was overtaken by what felt like extreme fear and confusion and couldn’t understand what was going on around me or what people were saying, and I could tell that no one could understand me either. I remember feeling trapped in my head and thinking that I wanted to go to the hospital except not in the country I was currently in. This went away after a few hours but I was completely freaking out. I even listened to a voice note I sent to someone and can hear that my voice was very weird and slow.

It makes sense that my disorder has gotten worse. I had ‘hopefully’ the most traumatic event of my life at the end of 2020. I saw my husband take his life. Typing this I feel nothing, when normally I’d be sobbing. It’s just something that happened. Since that, I have experienced more intense episodes. 

The one thing that I’ve never experienced before is going days where I do not care about anything. I try to care, and I guess I put up a good front… but the part of me that does care about my life, my family, loved ones etc kinda goes blank. I still care simply because human life matters. But I also wish I was removed from all of it. 

It’s not the same as depressive episodes, I’m not depressed. I’m not sad, I actually go outside and do things, but only because I know it matters to others. 

I’m also not manic. It’s something new, and right now I’m in one. Nothing bothers me, because nothing matters. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this.

Anyways, thanks for reading",8,0
223,147i6pa,Recurring mania,"Hi everyone! So this is my first time uploading on this subreddit but, I have something to ask to others with bipolar more specifically ones who are more often in manic/hypomanic episodes, I have extremely rapid cycling bipolar 1 and this year in 2023 I've so far had about 6 manic episodes... yep, it sounds a bit unbelievable even I don't believe it but I look back of all the symptoms of whenever it happens it most definitely is mania, but okay so one of my more specific ways I can mania is actually there is I begin to actually starve myself unintentionally and I get physically repulsed by all food, even if I try to eat it it tastes so bland to me that it makes me lose my appetite even more and this usually happens for about a week and then it ends and I eat like normal and my mood is normal... I usually try to calm the mania and unintentional starvation down with weed and when I run out the mania returns and it's just another vicious cycle...

231,1478bqi,Anyone in a successful relationship with someone who has bipolar?,"A while back I made a depressing post about if I’ll ever find someone due to my Bipolar 2.

All I’ve ever wanted was to find that one person who just seamlessly fits into my life. I want to find that forever person who I truly am happy with and can be myself around. I’m just scared I’ll never find that again. Within my post I explained why I think I could hopefully find it though due to my growth as an individual. 🥲

I’ve been *so f’in depressed* lately and just want to hear some inspiring stories about others being in a healthy, *long term,* committed relationship with someone who has bipolar. 

I want to hear from individuals who’ve been together for years and years and years, not from people in 2 or 3 year relationships. I’m looking for lifelong and want to hear from those who are in those relationships because of this.

*For added context:* I don’t settle, I have standards, so I’m very picky with who I let into my life and why it takes me a decent chunk of time to find someone between relationships. I know some people with bipolar have a tendency to jump but that’s not me.

233,1479olq,Diagnosis and self harm,"Hi. To start out with I’m a 24 year old gay male, who has had slight behavioral and mood problems since my mid teen years. Lots of issues at home as a kid, psychological and physically abusive step parents you know? 
Well my issues continued to get more and more frequent as an adult. Then when July hit last year, everything in my life absolutely blew up. I stopped sleeping, eating, caring about the state of my home. Calling off work frequently to the point I almost lost my job. Had black outs in memory, to the extent where I “woke up” on the ground in a corn field in the middle of a small thunderstorm. I had drove my car 7 miles away from home and parked on the side of the road near the field and walked through one of the plow lanes and fell back. I don’t know how long I was there. I don’t remember driving there or walking through the fields. I started hearing things, at home and at work. People calling my name when nobody was around, I heard my grandma talking to me. And she’s been dead for 12 years. Then it got to the point of hallucinations. Then I’d start to see my grandma, and the worst part was when I walked into my house and saw my stepfather running at me fist raised. He had been dead a year at that point and I hadn’t seen him in 9. Along with those I was seeing people in the darkness, watching me wherever I went. In the shadows of my house and at work. And at times it’d be like I had a United Nations Council going on in my head with so much talking I couldn’t comprehend it. And other times it would only be 4 or 5 voices at a time, and they would all sound like me, but they’d all say different things and it was like all the different parts of me were telling me what to do. As a result, one day when my head was splitting from all the congestion and screaming I took one of the things I was working on at work (I’m a welder), and pressed it deep into the exposed flesh under my PPE. That started to make things easier, it hurt so much I was able to focus on that instead of the circus I was seeing and hearing. So that’s what I kept on doing. Now despite this, I knew everything I was seeing and hearing wasn’t real. I knew my grandma and stepfather were dead. I knew the shadow people I kept seeing weren’t real. But the burning was the only way to help. There would be periods of time where I’d be okay, I wouldn’t sleep but I wouldn’t be tired. And then I’d start sleeping with any and all men who would have me without a second thought. That lead to me being sexually assaulted and almost killed at the hands of a dangerous man. But despite that I’d continue. I maxed out my credit cards within a month and was $10,000 in debt. I’d spend paychecks on things I didn’t need and then couldn’t pay my bills. And I started drinking more frequently, but not enough to where I’d be considered an alcoholic. I put myself in more dangerous situations. Speeding 20-40 miles over the limit, passing cars with cars approaching closely on the other side, trespassing on the stone quarry near my house, trying to climb the water tower near my house (and failing because it was raining and I kept slipping), wearing my headphones with loud music and my eyes closed on highly trafficked train tracks. 
Finally one day one of my coworkers was messing with me to the point where I thought I was hallucinating again. And it got to the point where I ran from work without a word to anyone. I went to the mental health clinic at my home town which was 12 miles away. After filling out the paperwork it took 3 weeks to get in with a clinical psychologist. When I did I told her everything, it took 4 sessions over a month to get everything in the air. 
My friends and family were unaware of the self harm. But they all agreed that at that time the psychologist should have had me hospitalized. 
She got me set up with a psychiatric nurse practitioner, who diagnosed me with Bipolar 1 with acute mania and psychotic disorder after reading everything in my chart and talking with me. And after my diagnose, my mother revealed that she received the same diagnoses after a suicide attempt 7 years past when she was in a psychiatric facility. She said based on her mother and her grandmother’s life and behavior they likely had the same. 

So my reason for posting is, do you agree that my first psychologist should have taken 
extreme measures for hospitalization?",4,0

Also, depressive episodes are crippling and the whole thing is rapid cycling, it is making me exhausted mentally and physically.

I also come from an incredibly unstable household. When I was around 24, I started to reject my diagnosis, I felt bitter about it given that it seemed like the problem was everyone else in my family. I hated the way they treated me over the years when it was clear to me they were the ones who need the most help. I was in an accident that gave me a concussion and shortly after healing I made the decision to stop my meds and seeing a psychiatrist. I felt I was sick and tired of feeling like my head was being fucked with and I was just in miserable circumstances. I loathed myself and the diagnosis which didn’t match up with the image I had of myself. I used all the coping skills I was taught in therapy and I graduated college and found a job and pushed through the pandemic. Except, now at 27 I’m spiraling again. All the classic symptoms are back and I’ve hit an all time low, I feel so stupid and guilty for feeling this way and for having stopped my treatment in the past.

274,146r73x,Butterflies in stomach - early sign of manic episode???,"Okay so I'm quite new to bipolar disorder symptoms, I honestly didn't know how serious this illness is.. I was ""diagnosed"" with borderline personality disorder before I turned 18 and it seemed legit, it helped me understand how my mind works, what triggers me and why, etc. 

But the past few months I realised that even though I'm mostly in a depressed state since I was a child, I often make a 180° turn and become especially confident and productive, I need less sleep, become more sexual, take risks, and overall I just try to live life to the fullest. Then I fall back into depression, sometimes without a reason, and then the good times seem like a lie to me. 

I never noticed this pattern before, but now at the beginning of this year I had a clearly manic episode (which then turned into psychosis) and I'm trying to put the pieces together. Looking back, one of the first signs of the starting mania was this feeling of ""butterflies"" in my belly. It's mostly a nice but overwhelming feeling in my lower stomach & private area. I was turned on 24/7 and no amount of masturbation / sex made it disappear. This time it's a little different because even when I'm not turned on it feels as if I am because of these ""butterflies"". 

I am really afraid that it's an early sign that I will spiral into another episode and maybe go into psychosis again. 

I started going to therapy but had to stop because I can't afford it right now. If I want to get free healthcare I have to wait 1-2 years. I would check into mental hospital if things get worse but I have two kids with no help, so that's not really an option. 

Is there any option to stop an upcoming manic episode other than medication? Please help me, I'm so scared. I made really dumb things the last time and I don't want to ruin my life any more.

I had 5 years history of GAD, depression for which i took 25 Zoloft, and some hypomanic episodes that no one took seriously until i got filmed how was behaving and described my psychiatrist how i was feeling.

 Last winter i had my first true major depression episode and they pumped me with 100 Zoloft. I went mad, anxious and furious with a sensation that i have something eating at me from the inside. She told me to wait at least 4-6 weeks and so i did but my symptoms were getting worse, not better as she said so i stopped it on my own and went finding another doctor

At first she thought too it was depression and anxiety. She tried 2 times (first with 25mg of zoloft and got agitated, then with 10mg of vortioxetine because i was depressed, both drove me mad) then she diagnosed me with BP 2 Something changed in my brain when i got pumped with 100 of zoloft. Before i could tolerate antidepressants.Not anymore. I have some questions

1.The last 3 days i felt so depressed that i sat nearly all day crying something in bed, but today i feel anxious again, but still anhedonic and cant eat. Can this happen or is it just cyclothimia or maybe a mixed episode? I read about this online
2. What is fast cycling, means i can feel better some days and then feel very depressed another day?I mostly am depressed that is why for the last 2 months they tried antidepressants
My doctor said she doesnt give antidepressants to people with agitated depression(maybe she wanted to say bipolar without me knowing?)

My friendships since high school (I’m now 25) have always been really tumultuous - either because I overestimate the care others have for me/too trusting and I end up getting hurt and taken advantage of, or I sabotage the friendship in an effort to protect myself if I perceive any possible psychological danger to myself….

This response I think is partly shaped by my trauma but I think mostly because of how my brain works. I feel big things all the time and some of those are fear and pain.

Im 26, had depressive episodes through out my whole life, got diagnosed with ADHD at 23yo and 2 years ago after a really bad hypomania (cheating, maxing out credit cards, drug abuse) I got diagnosed bipolar at 24yo. Both runs on both sides of my family so…. 
Me and my SO went through a really rough fase trying to repair all the damage I’ve done. We are doing a lot better now. 
I know the disorder is not responsible for everything I’ve done, now that I’m diagnosed I realise how I’ve could’ve tried to avoid/control it. 
Since then I’ve been taking lamotrigine, latuda and going to weekly therapy sessions, which are keeping me stable. I’m very aware of symptoms now.
The whole healing process after my hypomania gave me traumas, things were said and cant be taken back, some wounds are still healing, and thats ok. But every now and then when we have occasional conversations about things that happened he freaks out.
Every single time my diagnoses comes up my SO tries to invalidate my symptoms. He always begs me to be open and communicate about any issues I might be having with my mental health, but when I confide in him and bring up some symptoms I’m struggling with he dismisses it saying thats not the disorder, I’m just a bad person trying to justify bad things I’ve done.

This kills me. The stability came at very hard work and not being able to confide in my partner without getting invalidated its so discouraging. 
I’ll never hurt him again, I’m doing everything I can to ensure that, I love him.

**TW MENTION OF ATTEMPT SUBSTANCES AND SH**

Im 20, ive been in the mental health hell loop since 12/13 in offices but ive always struggled. Adopted mother used substances while in utero. My psychiatrist suspects im bipolar, has it on my chart with cptsd+anxiety; however, i dont feel like i am “sick enough” to have a genuine issue besides a fragile personality. Everything feels like how people normally live life but i dont know. Psych said (kindly) i am different and have a chemical imbalance. I feel like a fake, people genuinely struggle while i dont feel like i struggle enough. I undercut myself like that but its not like i can forget the years of inner turbulence, attempts, hospitalizations, or the scars i have. I dont feel like i suffer enough as i dont have frequent attempts, life wrecking decisions, and slightly gotten life together. Since i am still alive off meds its even more reason in my head that i am jus weak and alright. Meds made me lose my sense of self and constant inner dialogue. Family tolerates and treats me slightly better on meds, didnt know when i was off for months secretly as i can control my show of emotions well until the last crumb of me is devoured. Emotion showing is never good here. I plan of talking to my therapist about me being a fake but i had to jus get it out.",3,0

Sometimes a bit slips out, I feel like I have the plague and if I sniffle once suddenly I’m a freak show or a bratty kid. I’m really struggling with new management at my job. For context I work at a very chill and open minded small business, it’s a job I used to really enjoy. My old manager and me are extremely close and his wife has a mood disorder. With him I felt very connected and in the loop with my other managers and higher ups. New manager is the complete opposite, didn’t even know what manic meant. For about a month I was on the wrong meds and went through a mixed mania phase, now I feel like anything I have to say is ignored or dismissed as me just being the resident nut job. That shift has been extremely hard for me, my boss doesn’t like me as much, I’m written up far more, chastised for small mistakes, and am pulled aside for meetings that feel like I’m a child being scolded. All while feeling out of the loop with the rest of management. I do not feel comfortable telling upper management that I’m in a depressive or manic state to request shifts in work load, not being able to tell anyone to get accommodations has made me dislike a job that once made me extremely happy. I understand I’ll have to work until I’m dead, work is awful, and any tolerable work is good work but good damn going from being open about my struggles and getting support to being treated like a child is really fucking with me. I don’t want to quit cause I know everything else is worse or the same, I’m paid liveable wage, and I like the job and staff. I’m really considering trying to work for myself but I don’t have faith I could be consistent in it.

Every part of my life is like this. I try so so so so so so hard to be normal, but if I react moderately poorly to something even around people who struggle with anxiety and depression I’m shunned and treated like a bratty kid. I’m tired of being a problem, I’m tired of not being normal, I’m tired of not wanting to have friends cause I’m afraid of people leaving to tell everyone I’m crazy, and I’m tired of hiding every bad thing that’s eating my brain. 

I don’t understand why I can’t be normal it’s so extremely frustrating, I can’t even fix it I’m just stuck like this all cause someone was cruel to 5 year old me. I’m just stuck with this, I’m always gonna be the freak show. It makes me so sad.",7,0

Not even the lines from my mouth are my own

Born pigeon toed with an inability to hold my calories

Wailing and storming with a family home of gasoline

Doused for anything deemed weak—a stutter and tripping evaporates confidence

I’m not my own—baptized with mania as a teen, sticking fingers down my throat 

I’m not my own

Everyone an elephant on display—tethered for crowds—a spectacle when my mania comes around 


Hopping on planes—looking for an exclave—my family knocked me out the herd for too bing too feminine

They mold you and hold you for their esteem—those that lack it are prone to bleed

There’s no balance in it—a mere circus act—fetishization a ticket to get you feeling stable and fed

321,1463e5f,I’m finally starting to make some progress!,"I think I’ve only posted here once before. 
I was diagnosed with Bipolar 13 years ago. (I’m about to turn 26.) It has been a constant struggle to get reliable, consistent treatment. 

Last year, I started using Brave Health for my therapy/psychiatric needs. At the time, it didn’t cost anything because I was dirt poor and had insurance through the state of FL. 
I moved back to NY in November of ‘22. My therapist and psychiatrist were not licensed in NY, so they paired me with a psychiatrist who is licensed in NY, and put me on a wait-list for a therapist. I got new insurance through my employer, and updated the organization with this information. 

I felt like I was being jerked around by this new psychiatrist. She wouldn’t take me seriously. I was prescribed Aripiprazole and Hydroxyzine, which was an okay combination. I told her that it was helping, but at such a low dose, it wasn’t having any major effect. Instead of trying to increase the dose, she switched me to Latuda and Buspar, which was a terrible combination that made my symptoms worse. 
On top of that, nobody ever bothered to tell me that the organization does not accept my insurance, and I was being charged (unknowingly) upwards of $100/session. 

I have since stopped utilizing their services and I contacted my DO, who took over prescribing. She put me back on the original combo until I can get in to see a local mental health provider. 

I ALSO LEARNED that my thyroid levels are wayyyy off, which has a great impact on my mental health. For background, I had hyperthyroidism (diagnosed at 15?) and had a total thyroidectomy in 2017. I’ve been on Levothyroxine since then, but somehow my TSH levels got to 129.0 in January. (Normal range, according to provider is .27-4.2) 
I followed up with my endocrinologist, who made some medication adjustments and set dietary restrictions. 

I finally feel like we’re starting to get somewhere with treatment. I’m taking baby steps, but at least I’m heading in the right direction!",9,0

330,14652ec,How can i make life easier for my partner as someone with Bipolar?,"Hi! 

I am 24F and bipolar. I’ve been diagnosed three years ago, it’s been rough but I’m on meds and try to have a routine. I have very sharp mood swings throughout the day and I always feel ‘too much’.

I’ve been together with my bf(24M) for almost 2 years now. He has ADHD and derealization. We actually clicked because we were both struggling with the concept of reality since I’ve been having hallucinations that time. We help each other out. When we started dating, I wasn’t that bad with mood swings but throughout the year I got worse. He is so helpful, so nice and so understanding. He manages everything so well. But he says I usually confuse him because my mood changes so drastically and he doesn’t know what to do sometimes. I got sad over this and he said ‘It’s okay, u know I love challenges. Maintaining u is challenging but fun. I love to help’. He was so nice again. But what if one day he’ll say ‘It’s too much’ and leave? For example a few nights ago I asked him ‘What is a question u would like me to ask u frequently?’. He said ‘I would like it if u sometimes asked -would u like me to leave u alone?-. Bcuz sometimes I’m busy but I don’t want u to feel lonely or neglected so I make time for u but it prevents me from working since concentrating is hard for me’. I am gonna work on this. 

I am in a phase where I don’t really know myself if that makes sense. I can’t tell when I feel or think something if it’s bipolar or me genuinely. It’s hard as I don’t remember past very well. I don’t know who I was and I don’t know who I am. Sometimes it’s too much so I just go walk around for a few hours and he gets worried. I tell him where I am and when will I go home but he still feels uncomfortable. 

We have a healthy relationship, we never fight or hurt each other, we are best friends. I want to marry this guy, I want to be the best version of myself for him. We work in the same industry(game) and we have lots of fun. 

So my question is how can I help him and my relationship in general? Do u have any tips? And if u also have ADHD, what would u like ur partner to do about that?",5,0

I'm stuck in this weird stage where I can't do my hobbies. I either can't focus or I have lost interest in them. For example, it's hard to me to watch TV or movies. I get so restless. I find it virtually impossible to read books, novels, or even short stories as if I have a brain fog. I also find my other hobbies to be boring.

All day long I basically do nothing, only looking forward to bedtime.

My psychiatrist thinks the focus part might be due to executive dysfunction and possibly ADHD. In a little over of a week from now, I will get tested for it. I hope all I need is just a medication adjustment or a new med. Speaking of meds, my psychiatrist prescribed me Seroquel. They told me it should also help me with the med.

I have bipolar depression and it’s taken a toll on my mental health for many years now, but it’s getting a lot better! I was taking a medication for it and seeing a therapist, although I have since lost that form of insurance. I’m still currently looking into treatments but I’m waiting for my insurance to switch over so it’ll be covered again. 

Anyhow, I’m trying my best to deal with it and haven’t had any significant mood swings in a while, however, last night my boyfriend and I were painting when I started to become a little more reserved. It’s hard for me to explain what I’m feeling during those times other than “low” or “low energy”. I just want to exist and not make many decisions during that time and be on autopilot. But it’s also very difficult for him because it makes him think I’m upset with him. Admittedly, I’ve had and sometimes continue to struggle with telling my partner when I’m upset and I’ll wait a few hours before I do instead of telling him as it happens. But because of this, it makes him think I’m upset with him when I’m depressed. This morning it really hurt his feelings and it made me a little frustrated since I’m still feeling gross. I know his feelings are valid and I want him to realize my mood has nothing to do with him and I still want to spend time with him during that time, but I’m just on low battery mode until it goes away in a bit. Part of me feels like I’m being unfair because his feelings are warranted but I also feel like crap because I can’t help how I get during those times. 

Anyhow, I was looking at articles to see if there were better coping strategies for me during that time and I found a lot of helping resources for dealing with a bipolar partner, but I’m currently trying to find something on how to support and reassure your partner when you’re going through an episode. Being talkative just makes me feel worse and I don’t know if I can force it, but I want to find something to show him that shows I care and do want to help him as well. I really love him and don’t want to hurt him like this. Any helpful articles of coping strategies are extremely welcome and thank you to whoever took their time reading this! Have a great day!",4,0
335,1465xmh,I feel crazy. What should I do?,"If you can give me some advice, please do!

I have severe social anxiety. It works in weird ways, because yes, I have traveled a lot and went many different places but I STILL fear the possibility of being put in an awkward situation. 

The lengths I will go to, to get out of a social situation if I feel it might be awkward for me, are deep.

My sister is very close to me. She has a new boyfriend, and he's a really great guy. But I'm tired of all the time they've been spending together. (This is selfish, I know, but really good because it means they're really into each other and my sister deserves that.)

I'm at her house a lot lately. He has a kid and he brings him over and my nephew plays with him, and its a lot of cute family time moments. But these are people I do not know well. 

So, I'm really nervous. 

I also have father/trauma  issues which might contribute to my being nervous around men more than women. 

Anyway, they want me to go to a comedy club with them. It'll be dark inside the club, they'll be laughs, drinks, fun. They want me to get out the house. I think my sister worries about me staying inside all the time and her boyfriend as well. 

I'd rather stay home and babysit my nephew and sigh in peace at being alone. (My nephew is six and it is surprisingly way less exhausting being just with him.) 

I do not want to go. I'm desperate not to go. I'm scared to be around my sister's boyfriend. He's a really great guy and has given me no reason to be afraid or nervous around him. And, I really, really like him for my sister. I don't want to appear like I don't like him by being standoffish.

But I don't feel like being in a social situation that might be awkward. I might do or say weird things I don't mean to do, because sometimes I'm unsure how to respond well in social situations. I'm terrified of that happening. I have to copy other people and what they might say or do, and I don't do that well. Sometimes it comes out wrong.

So, I have a plan. I could let my mom do my hair and join them for the comedy club. Maybe  have some fun, interact with my sisters boyfriend and maybe it won't be so bad. 

OR: I could call my mom and tell her to come by later at 6pm and take as long as she likes doing my hair so I can miss going to the comedy club. I'll tell her I have things to do and can only get it done at 6pm. (She's braiding my hair and it does take awhile but not THAT long) 

A part of me feels like because I feel so afraid of going, that maybe I should try to make myself go. That I'll always be afraid if I don't push myself, and I shouldn't live life that way. 

Any advice?",3,0

I feel like there’s so much to do, and I’ve been feeling so creative and motivated recently…I don’t like the idea of taking a break and slowing down right now :(.

I can't calm it down, nor stop coming mixed states. It was new experience for me and at the same time tragic. I realized that now I am completely dependent of outside forces, like medication. Someone of you guys, with similar experience, you have thought why you can't control your mind anymore, it seems like brain is not reacting to your thoughts anymore ?

but i am so angry. all the time. constantly. just in the last few months i've noticed it's out of control. i sit in my car and scream, i scream into pillows, i threw every piece of clothing i own out of my closet and broke a curtain rod, i mean i am yelling at people in PUBLIC now. this is not me and this has never been me.  it's almost like subconsciously i've been protecting myself from that rage for so long? i've always felt like i get irrationally angry sometimes but i'm usually able to tell myself to cool it no problem but now it's like the rational part of me has disappeared and i'm a completely different person now.

I (33f) am currently on the following meds:

75mg Zoloft (was 100mg…)
100mg Lamictal
40mg Latuda

Last week friday, my psychiatrist started to decrease my Zoloft. Throughout the days following the initial decrease, I started to have adverse side effects; brain zaps, tingling on the left side of my, etc. The brain zaps got so intense that I ended up in the ER.

They ran a bunch of tests like chest x-ray, blood work, and 3 different MRI’s.

Once my results were back, I was told that my symptoms were due to Zoloft decrease, and they are happy that I came in, as they MRI found an umruptured 5mm aneurysm in my brain. It is small enough that it did not require immediate surgery, so they sent me home with instructions on how to contact a neurologist & neurosurgeon near me.

With all that being said, I was also diagnosed with: bipolar II, ocd, adhd, ptsd, bed, and bpd traits at the beginning of this year. I can’t help but obsess over thinking that stress from all my illnesses caused this.

I am feeling the absolute lowest that I’ve ever felt in my life. All I can think about is that life is not fair & that I don’t want to be here anymore.

originally when i started this job (cleaning houses) i said i wanted to work 4-5 days a week (I’m home from uni for the summer and don’t need to be maximizing profits, just optimizing rest). i had to work 6 days this week, and i worked 4 shifts one of those days (i usually work 2 a day). my boss said she would try to give me the following day off if i took the double, so i did, but then she didn’t cancel 1 of my shifts and then asked me if i could work another. during work today she asked me if i could babysit for her after my 2nd shift (i said no, i’m terrible with kids) and then once i got home i got another text asking if i could work tomorrow (my only day off until next saturday). i said no because i’m donating blood and that i couldn’t anyway because “my disability” worsens severely when i’m overworked (i don’t like to get specific bc of the way people treat me after they know).

ultimately it’s all fine and i am capable of putting my foot down, but i just hate knowing that any of this is expected of me bc then something normal (not wanting to work 13 days in a row????) seems unreasonable and i feel weak for not being able to come through. 

i can already feel myself getting exhausted and depressed, and i’m frustrated with myself for not putting my foot down earlier. and i’m anxious about reminding her how many days i originally agreed to work. who else struggles with their limits in a work setting? what helps you manage yourself so that you feel capable and helpful but still rested and respected?",7,0
374,145ool8,Help with rage,"Having an episode, but instead of straight mania or depression, it's mixed. YAY! The erratic back and forth emotions are mild enough that it's easy to cope with and so far has just been episodic throughout the day instead of constant. It comes out really bad when I get home from work because I'm just so exhausted from keeping it reeled in all day. 

For the first time ever I'm experiencing more than just irritability. It's just outright rage. I've lost my shit on my coworkers twice now. I have been sitting in my car just screaming obscenities when I can't hold it inside anymore. I smashed half of my dishes on my kitchen floor. Haven't bothered to clean it up because it just makes me angry to look at. I relapsed back into self harm because I've been internalizing it and then inflicting it on myself when I can't suppress it anymore and it just vomits out of me.

I don't know how to cope with this. I don't know if it's going to turn into violence or how to know when I've reached the point where I'm a danger to other people. I don't have any experience to inform me. I've never been so angry in my life.

376,145bq1n,I’ve had a very sad thought last night — I think I’m fated to loneliness.,"Last night I was thinking of this guy I met last time I was hospitalized.

He was from the drug abuse division, but we started interacting and got closer. 

We planned to see each other outside. But I left before him and I talked here, with friends, a relative, and everybody told me that I shouldn’t get involved with someone who is a drug abuser. 

So I distanced myself and kinda stopped replying to him. 

But last night he came to mind and I wondered if he’s okay. He’s disappeared from social media for a while now and I checked his mother and she posted something about this place where people go for treatment. Can’t know for sure if he’s there. 

Anyways, that made me think that I couldn’t be with him because I know he can get violent — he told me he punched a wall and broke his hands to not punch his partner, prior to that hospitalization.

That’s really scary and I feel like I would be afraid to sleep with him and maybe one day I wake up with him punching me. A person here shared a story like that with me.

Then I had realized that it can and will probably happen to me as well.

Who would be comfortable knowing that “anytime” I can flip and turn into a person completely lost from reality, and who has no control over their actions? 

I feel like no one sane enough would play this bet. So, now, I’m thinking I’ll just die alone and that sounds so sad.

It doesn’t seem to matter if I’m stable, manic or depressed, the food aversion remains. I’ve been on 4 different meds since I was diagnosed 8 months ago and each time my doctor says “hopefully as you level out the appetite will improve.” I haven’t experienced an improvement yet. Some drugs have slowed my weight loss, but none have caused me to gain weight or even stop losing. I’ve lost over 50 pounds in the last year or so and I feel weak. I can tell I’m not getting enough to eat, but I don’t know how to stop feeling viscerally disgusted by food.

Hi Folks,

I am so glad i found this subreddit. Makes me feel less alone. 

I was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline in 2020. I have been on 200mg quetiapine for a long time. (3 years ago it was 450mg and we were planning on gradually reducing it further, but my doctor after 3 years disappeared into thin air without notifying me beforehand). The last 3 years have been the most stable and fulfilling time of my life. I learnt how to be alone, stopped getting into abusive relationships, finished my degree, started becoming successful with making films (which had been my big dream since i was a child), held down a job with reasonable pay, etc. But in March, my doctor disappeared and i also got diagnosed with insulin resistance, which could have developed as a side effect of quetiapine. So i went to the hospital for a month to set my meds and to take part in a CBT group. It was nice, but the doctors there didn't really believe my diagnosis from 3 years ago, they said I'm ""only"" borderline.. And we reduced the meds to 0. 

But I am getting weird. Everything feels funny, i lose sense of time often.. And i think I may have stepped over someone's boundaries this morning. I just had a conversation with a person in an elevator. It felt good. Unfortunately, i took my efforts to track them down (we did not share any contact, all i knew was that live in the same building, but I used all my creativity and resources to find out where they live) successfully in 1 hour, and i asked them if they want to talk. Of course this pushed them away. I mean i think they got creeped out.

I feel ashamed and i wish i hadn't done it. I don't want to scare people. I don't want to step over boundaries. 

(I'm 25F and i reallyreallyreallly just wanted to talk again to the person who was a woman whom i felt i could really related to.)

I feel, think and act weird. This is not the me i've spent the last 3 years with. 

I feel everything and nothing at the same time, all the time. Everything looks and smells nice. I wish i could just spend the whole day looking at the clouds and the flowers without having to eat, sleep, work, etc.. It feels ""fun"", but not the type of ""fun"" i should be having. I forget to close the door of my apartment.. I forget where i put my stuff.. Losing track of days,.. Time.. Not cool.. 

Oh, and my sleep quality is the worst. I wake up too early, and i can't go back to sleep after that. 

I feel like a machine that just simply can't be turned off.

411,145f4l4,Just need to share my feelings about a sibling. We are both bipolar.,"This might be a long post but I really just need to get it off my chest.

My sibling (non binary) has been tormenting me since I was born. There are probably a lot of different diagnosis that would fit them and I wouldn't be surprised if they have BPD as well.

They are 4 years older and when they heard they were going to get a sister they didn't want me because they wanted a brother. I have bee unwanted by this individual that has existed in my life for 20+ years since before I was even born. When we were young it was a lot of fighting that sometimes would get physical. Once when I was 5-6 years old they put their hands around my throat and my side of the story is that I was being choked. My sibling has always and will always deny this fact and I honestly can't remember much from when I was younger so I don't know myself. I just know that to this day it is something that I remember as traumatic. It could be that my brain at that age made it out to be a scarier situation than it really was. My parents got very worried and was ofc upset with my sibling that has been upset with me since then for telling them that.

When I was around 10 years old my sibling moved away to live at a few different homes. This was the first time that my family had time to breathe and most of us broke down when we actually were able to look at ourselves and ask how we were doing (my brother has mild autism and ADD and mother has bipolar). When I was 10 years old i started regularly seeing a therapist, both on my own and as a family. I became depressed and got on antidepressants + was talking to a doctor about maybe having bipolar as well. They put me on a mild dose of lamictal that was actually helping a bit with my depression (I have bp2 so my BP is mostly depression and hypomanic episodes weren't that noticeable to me at that point).

Our family was a mess and my sibling still lived in homes pretty close by. I remember how they once walked back home in late autumn and the post car picked them up in the morning since they were walking around in a fucking t-shirt. Early morning we were woken up by them knocking on our door saying they wanted to come back home. After a while they moved to a home where teens with mental disabilities could go to get treatment while being able to go to school as well.

When I was around 11 my sibling called home one evening saying they were going to end themselves. They were talking about how I would get their laptop and my brother would get their cat like it wasn't that big of a deal. They lived about 3 hours away by car at this point and there was nothing we could do. We tried to contact police around there to help us but they were out and talking about doing it with railways so it wasn't easy to find them. The police did eventually find them and brought them back to the home and we went to visit a couple of days later. They were walking around laughing with one of their close friends as if nothing had happened a few days before (I will never forget that day when our whole family were crying around the kitchen table feeling hopeless for hours and not knowing if we'd already lost them). When some of my friends in school the day after asked why I didn't come to the thing we'd planned the day before I honestly didn't know what to say because none of them would ever be able to imagine what I'd been through or hopefully have to experience anything like it.

A lot of years from then until now where they aren't taking their meds, sleeping properly or realising that they need A LOT of help. When you talk to them it's either a mental breakdown where they run out screaming and crying (throwing a tantrum like a 5yo) or having a decent conversation where you feel like you're actually getting somewhere (only to be forgotten within s few days). They live with my Grampa and brother, siblings have the upstairs. I'm honestly happy Grampa has a hard time making it upstairs at this point because the place is a complete mess that would need professional cleaning to ever look like a living space. They occupy my room whenever I'm not here and it's full of a lot of things whenever I do go here (staying here in the summers to help Grampa with the big garden) and I honestly can't deal with it. When I got here this time they had to do the washing to get me some clean sheets. They were sleeping on the sofa in their room because they had no clean sheets while my brother was sleeping on the sofa downstairs since he had none. I had to fold the rest of the sheets when I got here because they were just in a pile on a chair downstairs and I realised my brother was crashing on the sofa downstairs when he was there before I woke up 2 days in a row. This was AFTER the sheets were cleaned. For him to actually change his sheets I had to put them on his bed and then come back later to make sure he started changing them.

My Grampa has stopped trying to make any changes in the dynamic because it just ends up with mental breakdowns, so he as a 80+ yo with issues with arms and shoulders are doing a lot of chores on his own. The sink upstairs is almost completely clogged and the shower is so unused that there are bugs crawling in it. We have for a long time tried to get the government to help BOTH of my siblings but whenever any help is offered they decline. I feel like I get forgotten a lot especially with my sibling since I function semi normal most of the time. I take my meds and most of the time sleep properly (hypomanis episodes fuck with my sleep) and most of the time function properly. But it's like they both forget that I'm also ill and have bat shit crazy depressions where I barely get out of bed. 

The thing that is upsetting me the most at the moment is when my sibling talks about how ""we'll"" make sure to do things. I actually want to slap them (sorry about being graphic) because they actually have the audacity to include themselves in helping our grandfather when I'm here. I agree that they sometimes do something but my god you are not taking care of him. If someone is visiting and they try to take the credit of ""yeah, you know we help Grampa out with the garden and chores"" I honestly want to laugh out loud. I've tried talking to them about it and saying they shouldn't be talking like that when they aren't doing that much. But in their mind they are. Maybe they might be doing something when I'm not here, but they sure as hell aren't when I am.

This post is long af and I don't know if anyone will ever read it, but I really needed to rant about this. I feel like every outburst and mental breakdown they are having is slowly tearing away prices of me and I'm trying to meditate and let go of the negative emotions about it all since I don't want Grampas last years to see the garden he's been working on his whole life wither away before his eyes. I'm trying my best to keep it together and we'll see how long I'll be able to stay here, we're a week into it at this point and it's been shipping away at me.

After a long day of working outside they want to hang out and play things or watch stuff while I'm really tired, but turning them away means hurting them emotionally which leads to a tantrum of screaming and crying. My mother has broken contact mostly since they get things like them abandoning them when they were a kid and not enough as a mother thrown in their face every other time they talk and my father is doing his best to be of support. He is hanging out a few times a week in the evening and trying to spend some time with them since they feel alone. Text or call every morning and evening to tell them to take their meds (which mostly still don't) and answers almost any hour of the day when they call him. I've realised recently that he does a lot more than I thought he was since I live a while away from here and don't see them too much. But my dad is working a full time job and lives with his fiancé while trying to take care of 2 people over 20 years old that had no concept of personal hygiene or cleaning at all (I don't enter my brother's room in fear of things moving on their own).

I don't think I'll be having much contact with either of my siblings (brother rarely returns calls or texts anyways) after Grampa dies. Right now I want a relationship with him and it's basically impossible to cut then out of my life since they live with him. My sibling has got it into their mind that they need us to help them through their trauma, which I can understand to a degree, but I'm not up for that shit. They made my life a living hell as a kid and I barely have any good memories with my family because they always needed all of the attention. A lot of it is a fog because I have mentally blocked a lot of it out. The fact that they feel entitled to me helping them in any way is one of the most selfish things they have ever done to me and it's hard to deal with that fact.

I'm dreading and looking forward to the day Grampa moves on and joins grandma in a better place since that will be the end of a lot of suffering for me. But until then I'm ready to try and put up with all of this, for him, my only living grandparent I have left.

I feel a big better after this rant and feel like I can keep going for a few more weeks here (hopefully)",1,0

420,144zxh7,Seeking advice/wisdom on how to get through this very hectic period of my life (first post),"M | 28 | Bipolar II w/ heavy anxiety & depression, substance use issues, and (probably) ADHD & mild ASD


Hi y’all,

I’m coming to this community for support because for the last 4 weeks I feel like I’m losing control of my life and that I’m very close to falling apart completely.

About 4 weeks ago my grandfather had a very close brush with death and, since I’m very close to him, I semi-manically decided to pull the trigger on moving back home (a cross-country move). This had been something I’d had in the back of my mind lately, but due to recent events and my lease ending very shortly, I quickly committed. Although I have had little periods where I’m calm and level headed to sit down and actually plan this move, I feel like most days/moments I’m totally overwhelmed with the fear that somehow I’m definitely going to fuck this up. Whether that’s running out of money, having something come up during my drive I can’t handle, or messing up something with my family once I get there. 

And all of this mental/emotional turmoil & stress is negatively manifesting in my body (sore muscles, existing underlying pains are magnified, my immune system is shit) and in my behavior/actions (I’ve been really unable to focus at work/home, I’ve called out/left work a couple times, making up a medical issue to cover up my mental instability, and having conversations with family that tbh I’d even be a little worried about if I were them).

To add to all of this I have been getting high (weed) all day every day (which tbh isn’t very new at all, but lately I feel like it’s been fucking with my grasp on reality, along with other long term cognitive stuff). Also my caffeine intake has been crazy high (200-400 avg., can be up 600-700, daily) which I hate because it makes me so damn anxious & tense. But I can’t really stop/restrict myself because I believe it’s helping me (and tbh it really is the only thing powering me, especially since it’s not uncommon for me to eat just once a day before I go to bed). And in full disclosure my spending has been a little reckless, I just had a mini ritalin bender (that WAS for my moving drive…), I’ve drank alcohol twice in the last week (which I never really do), and my time spent on porn is becoming unhealthy. 

Moreover, I will be saying goodbye to a state that has been my home for 11 years and is where I became an adult. There are many feelings of regret, sadness, loss, joy, relief, and failure that I can feel that I’m not fully processing at this time. Pushing them down just below the surface.

I know in my logical mind that I’ve just really fucked up my brain chemistry this past 1.5 weeks, and that I wasn’t starting off in too good of a spot, and that I just have to ride this wave out. And I know that I’m like 85-90% sure I’m ready/prepared for this move (and that I have some support system if things go wrong). And I know, in my heart, that this really is the best move for me right now. 

But y’all, I really do feel like I’m losing it and that I’m on a slippery slope into breaking/going into psychosis - and I just can’t break out of the intrusive thoughts that keep me from getting excited & motivated for this move and the planning it takes. 

Anyways, thank you all for reading all of this, and please if you have any wisdom or words of encouragement to share, please do. 

Thanks again.",5,0
421,144uing,Telling people you're bipolar,"Hi there! I see pretty often on this subreddit posts about not telling people you are bipolar. I find this very interesting as I am pretty open about it to relatively anyone I converse with on a regular basis. To me it is simply something that comes up in conversation as almost everything relevant to my life has been traced back to it. After lurking on this subreddit for quite a bit a time I am beginning to doubt whether this is truly the best thing for myself.

&#x200B;

A few things to consider in my mind are that I don't communicate this to superiors at jobs or in general, it is only to my peers; furthermore, I am pretty young and wonder if this in large part a generational difference given people my age grew up in an environment even slightly more accepting of mental illnesses than even 10 years ago. I also do test the waters of people's opinions of people with mental illnesses before I reveal anything to others.  


I am just curious as to what other people's pros and cons are regarding this, I can't guarantee anything said changes my opinions or actions, but I do wonder if I am just weird and off putting or if this is totally sane behavior. I do like to think it helps to shift some stigma about bipolar in my personal life however.",9,0

I didn't have time to even think, spend time with myself or with my family/friends. It's exciting to know I'm going to have so much spare time to do the things I wasn't able to do, but it's scary. I spent the whole summer only staying in bed and watching videos when I was 13. I'm scared I'm going to do the same, which just sends me into depression. Having too much time alone also sometimes triggers my hypomania. I literally ""attack"" everything around me while trying to kill some time.

A couple of years ago all of this would have been my biggest dream to achieve. But i am just feeling so MEH about everything. And i can't describe this feeling because it's the first time that it is this exact feeling that I am feeling. I just had a depression, a severe depression, and it just continued and evolved into this feeling of nothingness. 

My bff got engaged and I had to PRETEND to be excited for her. PRETEND. The real me is excited and I know my heart isn't this cold. I love her to death and I've always wanted this for her because it has been her biggest dream. But the fact that I had to fake and pretend happiness for her??? I just reacted how she would expect me to react and told her what I normally would say when I'm excited. But i felt .. hollow inside 

But since I can't describe it, since I 'on paper' am living the life and have accomplished so many things at such a young age, the psychiatrist really has a way of saying: ""well you're functioning"" 

When in reality i am not.

i am thinking that I can't stand another day of feeling.. unsatisfied and unhappy isn't even the words to describe it with ..but rather feeling NOTHING

I'd honestly rather have a depression og manic episode than feeling this numb

Anyone else felt this... nothingness before?",87,0

TRIGGER WARNING: Workplace SA



I work at my old high school. I live the people I work with so much. But this year, we got some new teachers. And one of them got super inappropriate with me. He did it slowly. He made it seem like we were just buddies at first. And then he told me that I had put off a vibe to him that I was into him, and he wanted to tell me before I put it on the table that he was “down”. I have always had major issues saying no to people. I told him I was uncomfortable in the nicest ways I could think of. Things just kept getting worse. 
One day, he got me to come to his classroom under the guise that he needed to speak to me. I made him promise we would ONLY be speaking and nothing else. His door was locked when I got there. And still locked when he let me in. I wasn’t thinking that you could still open the door from the inside. I was intimidated and nervous. The moment the door shut, he grabbed my chest with both hands and looked me dead in the face the whole time. I retracted and reminded him that’s not why I was there. We did speak about what I came there to speak about. And then as I got up to leave, he walked to the side of his desk, tapped it a few times and said, “I could fuck you right here, or you can blow me before you leave.” 

I have been in the process of recovering from an attempt on my life that caused me to have to move from Missouri all the way back to Arizona. It’s been along road full of intense highs and very low lows… but I was finally starting to stabilize. And then this happened. 

I was afraid. I wasn’t thinking straight. All I could think of was “I cannot let this man inside of me.” So I chose to do what I felt would be the “least damaging” option. 

I tried to hide it for months. I tried to ignore him as much as possible after that. But when I wouldn’t respond to messages, he would just find me in person. The things he would say to me were outrageously explicit. I told him uncountable times I was uncomfortable. I ended up reporting him on the last day of school about two weeks ago. 

I’ve spent the first two weeks of my summer in bed. I have slept through most of my days and most of the night. I can barely function even on my adderall XR and Zoloft. (I know zoloft isn’t right for everyone who is bipolar, but for me it’s been the only thing I’ve taken that works and I’ve been on a plethora of antipsychotics and they don’t work for me.) 

Today I took a half of a Klonopin and it helped me immensely. But I can’t rely on it every day. HR will be contacting him soon for an interview. I’m afraid. I’m stressed. I’m anxious. I feel guilty for saying anything. I feel guilty for his wife and his kids…. 

How do I keep going? How do I make myself get out of bed and function again? It’s never been this bad before. I don’t want to get back to the place I was just two years ago when I’ve come so far…",2,0

Lasso the bells off the cattle

Shallow it is to fill before dining 

No confusion amongst the jury 

My personal verdict reading: “No tethering to the post tightly in the cement block”

Her never moving amongst the frailer sails 

Sweet is privilege 

Where narcissists have rail.



When the husband doesn’t know the bell—

She scurries amongst murk to bottom feed on a stranger

Her analysis and thought: “22 looked to be pulled along like a carp to angler”.




I…

Starved… spastic, frantic idiot—set to be carved by a mid-aged charlatan

So hurried; transplanted so far off—impulsivity a spasm

Caught off; asphyxiated by confusion of new culture and language 

Blemished with delusions and suicidality

Wailing vulnerably—in the open with a mind of neon pulsating “pounce me”.



Cycling, habit—egos gonna suck me

Deplete to serve—a skeleton not my own

Depravity amongst gravity makes a blackhole 

Torn, splintered; older me knowing what human interaction means 

Being spat upon and beautified with ornaments on me

A brick amongst the others

Her eye attracted to the younger ones desperate and in the need for help

Not respected—a jester who swelters amongst his thoughts 

“Where has all my marrow gone?”

When so bare they decorate you up

These ornaments all over; illusive are the heavier ones

Bringing all my locomotion to a halt

No clamor from the audience 

Fate is engrained in my thoughts 

Never polite to be fretful in face when others are to be waited upon.",1,0
460,144kdyf,After my first big manic episode I just got a BP diagnosis,"Hi everyone, I just got a diagnosis which I did not expect at all and I just don’t know how to feel. I have had multiple depressive episodes with the biggest one happening last September. We ( my psychiatrist, my psychologist and myself ) thought it was a burn out which culminated on an out of nowhere SA. I also have ADHD and was treated both for depression and ADHD. 
This past weekend I have not slept for 42h straight and I felt amazing. The best I ever felt, super energised, talked for hours without stopping, had amazing sex with my husband while the week before I was super depressed. Today I had my usual psychiatrist appointment and after talking to him about all that, he asked me so questions to evaluate me and told me I just had a manic episode. And that I should stop taking my anti depressants right away. 
It’s kind of hard knowing what to think. It felt amazing. I don’t know why people would take meds to not feel like this.

462,144nevg,Disclosing to Employers,"I've seen a lot of posts about when to tell employers or acquaintances about your diagnosis and most seem to say you just shouldn't do it.  I know I'm lucky with where I work now in that they take employee mental health VERY seriously (I work with vulnerable adults which can be very taxing for everyone), but even when I worked as a housekeeper for a hotel I had it down under disabilities.  Here's my reasoning:

I don't want my employer to be caught off guard when I start acting oddly and I think it helps having more people around who can help clock symptoms.  I do know a lot of times people can be very disrespectful about this though.

The biggest reason is reasonable accommodation as per the Americans with Disabilities Act (something I know a lot about thanks to my job).  When I'm manic there is a very specific way I know I can keep productive and if that isn't possible then I need to change schedule or take time off.  Time off of course only needs a note and doesn't need to be specific.  As a housekeeper having disclosed my diagnosis meant when I told them I was having an episode and needed to have my accommodations and they said ""we'll see"" I was able to say ""no, either I have the accommodations as specified or I'm going home and you can't retaliate or I swear to god I'll sue you"" (I was bluffing on that part, I don't have the money to sue, lol).

I am still hopeful for med changes to lead to overall health goals, even with the current stuff being so severe I think it'll be worth it. So I haven't jumped ship yet!! Even tho yest was tempting. I knew it would be hard but whew!

Multiple treatments, trying different medications and their side effects, experiencing mania and depression. This disease isn’t easy to cope with or to manage. So hearing it used to describe something so trivial really makes me mad because they’re making light of it (in my mind).

I make myself citrus or cucumber water and store it in the fridge. I just purchase one cucumber or lemon at the store and place it in a pitcher that I fill up.  Takes 5 minutes to chop and only 1 min to refill daily.

I change the locations of the pillows and blankets on the couch. This sounds stupid but it allows variety and so I can feel a ""different"" comfy each day.

I got a couple of candles. I light a different one each time depending on my mood. Citrus for energy, lavender for relaxing.

I got a ""special"" ice cube tray. It was like a $5 for a variety pack. Now i can get those tiny little crunch ones. Makes me feel like i am fancy.

487,143ue8e,Lost another job.,"First time poster. 56 yo male. Only a handful of family members know I was diagnosed 15 years ago. Mom and brother seem to dismiss it. They think just because my dad had a temper that I have a temper, and not bipolar. Although, I check pretty much every box on the ""Are you bipolar"" questionnaire.

I was just let go from my 2nd job in 9 months. The first was for asking a gal who was verbally harassing me to ""please shut the fuck up"". I was very polite about it. They fired me for 'aggressive behavior'. The fired her 3 months later as she was a trouble maker and lied, alot.

This time was for differences with the big boss. He was a micro-manager and liked to talk behind my back to the line workers and office staff. He never came to me about issues, only them. He is a half owner in the business, so what he wants, he gets. This is the first time I've ever told an employer about my bipolar, but they didn't seem to think much about it. They said he and I can't see eye to eye, and he owns half the business, so....

I can't count the number of jobs I've lost or walked away from over the years. I'm now at an age and point in my life that I wonder if I'll ever own a home again. Will I ever retire. Can I hold a job for more than a couple years?

I don't really want to talk to anyone locally, because I don't want to end up in a data base, with very little help in exchange for it. I was diagnosed years ago by a doctor, and everyone just keeps filling the Seroquel script every month since. No need to confess my life to someone to confirm anything.

I've lived the good life, and I've lived the simple life. I'm good either way. I've strived to achieve and live the good life for the past 22 years.

488,143r1hk,It's my birthday.,"It's my birthday and I'm spending it without friends or doing any big celebration or anything. I've had some really great birthdays in the past. I usually go on trips, have really sweet celebrations with my husband, and a long time ago, got together with a lot of friends. 

I don't really have any friends anymore to see on birthdays. (This is of my own doing and I understand that and am perfectly okay with that for the most part) I'm also without my husband because he's still stuck in a work contract. I've been having a few depressive episodes maybe its because my husband's gone or that I don't really have any friends to hang out with, but I'm going to be completely honest with myself and say that I know it isn't really any of those things. I have depressive episodes for just about anything. I had a full on meltdown and was having a few thoughts of suicidal ideation when a moth got into the house a few days ago. It sucks to be like that. To have episodes for any reason. Moths don't seem that big of a deal to anyone else. Definitely not enough to end your life over. 

Family have been surprised I don't want to atleast go out to out and things but honestly I just want to go to the bookstore get a few horror books, stay home the rest of the day, play my favorite video game (The sims) watch old cartoons, maybe play my favorite online game and just relax.

Because, I've been stressing myself out so much lately. I have bipolar disorder and Autism, so I have a lot of social issues and its really, really HARD to be around people, or anyone. Even close family members. 

I'm always trying to remember if I'm saying the right things, wearing the right expressions, or doing something wrong, or being weird, or constantly thinking if others hate me even though I have no real reason for this thought, or overthinking simple social interactions to the point it stresses me to tears. It exhausts me doing this all day every day. So, yes. I want to stay home and be alone. I just want one day. One day without these constant thoughts of anxiety, depression, struggling to fit in and mask correctly, and maybe that sounds sad, but I prefer not to dwell on that, and just be happy my mind can maybe be a bit quiet this one day. That's all I want for my birthday at this point.",24,0

What I really need is a change in my medication. However, my psychiatrist keeps cancelling my appointments. It’s now been over 5 months since I last saw him.

After I went to the hospital, my community mental health team referred me to the home treatment team. They discharged me the same day they met me, citing that I, somehow, disengaged from them. 

I went back to my community mental health team, their advice was to ring the out of hours GP and start the process to be hospitalised. Apparently, it takes a GP and a social worker. My mother rings the out-of-hours GP and he asks me if I feel unwell. Because I answered “yes,” I was told I have insight and that there was nothing he could do. Oh, and to also go back to the same hospital who discharged me.

Diagnosed with ""mixed bipolar"" per my psychiatrist. Anger is really almost too common of an emotion for me, so arguments happen really quickly - even if I'm not meaning for them to. Or even have a reason to be angry?

Anyway, I'm writing this because I'm curious. After a while in most arguments, I can't help but laugh. It's not like a ""I'm Laughing AT you!"" It's just .... I can't keep a straight face. I have no idea what comes over me but I can't keep my smile away. It's actually uncontrollable. And when I do surpress it, it looks (probably) even worse that I'm hiding laughter.

Almost everytime it happens, the other person gets so much angrier. I get it, it seems like I'm laughing at you. In reality, I have no idea why I started laughing. Sometimes it's just a grin, tonight I was staring the other person in the eyes and just . . . Let out a laugh. Short. But it was enough for them to become so much more irritated at me. 

""I can't stand it when you do that shit.""

Me neither!

I was thinking maybe it's just the sudden hit of ""I'm Done Arguing."" Because sometimes halfway through arguments, my mood will change and I'm over it - done. Ready to move on. Like it never happened.

I by no means miss the mania that led me to being hospitalized. But I miss this productivity that the meds somewhat stabilized for the better. I know this is for the better. And for everyone's benefit but I can't help but think I could be achieving much more with my few passions I alternate through. 

Obviously I am not going to stop this medication but I certainly wish I had some of that energy one of these days. 

It's now strange that I find myself drinking more than 6 oz of coffee a day. Feeling as normal as I can say ; given that normal is a feeling long dormant.",10,0

521,143kdct,Bipolar Medical Leave,"First time posting in here. I typically read threads in this group but don’t post. Hoping to gain some insight.

Hi friends, I have a bit of a dilemma. My medical leave from work has run out, and my job is no longer willing to accommodate additional medical leave regardless of what my doctor recommends. Little back story: I suffer from Bipolar I, anxiety, and PTSD. I will admit I’ve been off work intermittently for  about a year, in that time I was hospitalized 5 times, and completed several PHPs and IOPs. Any time off work has truly been spent trying to better my mental health.

Originally, I was given 4 options to choose from when returning to work: 

return to banking (roughly 60 hrs per week in a high pressure sales environment)

Return to banking with reduced hours (40/wk) still a high pressure sales environment, but the kicker is I would still have to do the same amount of work as my teammates working 60+ hours per week

Separate from the company (terrified of not having health insurance as my treatment is rather intense)

Find a new role within the same company- I was told I was have 30 days to find a posted position through the internal system and interview for said position.

I ultimately decided to search for a new role within the company. I like the idea of keeping my benefits and still working for a reputable company, not to mention I specifically moved to this state 3 years ago to pursue my original banking career. I have a lot invested in this company, but I know the pressure and work load may not be ideal for my mental health recovery. The new position would likely pay a little less, not being a sales based role, but I can afford to take a bit of a pay cut.

Fast forward to yesterday (technically day 1/30 to find a new position) I get a call from HR, giving me 3 options that I have to choose from within 24 hours if I want to maintain employment with the company.

1. Relocate 3 hours away to a different office to make roughly HALF of the income I have making previously. Totally not what I expected, and out of question.
2. Return to banking with reduced hours (40/wk). Still a very high pressure sales environment, where I am expect to give roughly 80 clients my personal cell number and be available at all times. The pay structure is based on your production goal for the month. I would still have the same production goals as my teammates, but have less time to make sales. 
3. Separate from the company effective today.
Im very frustrated, overwhelmed, and paralyzed by making such a huge decision in 24 hours. I did express that it seems unfair to give me 30 days initially then make me make a decision overnight.

I know looking for jobs outside of the company would be ideal, but I didn’t go to college so I’m just worried I’m not qualified to do much or make much in terms of pay. I’m not opposed to making less, but I got comfortable with the income I’ve been making for the last 3 years, and now have financial responsibilities I didn’t have previously (like a mortgage payment).

I just bought my house 2 years ago, it’s beautiful and I love it and the payment is very reasonable compared to rent in the area. 

I’m worried whatever decision I make will cost me my home. Moving to this state for the job and buying a house are probably my two biggest accomplishments in life.

I just have layers and layers of worry, making it impossible to make a decision.",4,0
522,143bg4y,I don't know how to do it anymore.,"The last month and a half has just been an absolute shit show and I don't know how to deal with it anymore.

This is long but I am hoping someone out there will read it. 

I moved in with my partner into an amazing apartment and in less than a month we were informed they're selling the building - after an extremely thorough application process where we stressed we were looking for someplace to live for at least the next three years. Now we have no guarantees of that. And I've had to work at home for all the viewings (we're still not fully unpacked and I hate it) so my cats don't get super stressed out but it's still affecting them majorly anyway. 

My job that I just started in February has progressively gotten harder and harder. I was given accounts that others did not want to deal with and now a plethora of procedure changes have made my accounts as difficult as the team member who has been there for 20+ years while the other newer member of the team just tried to pass on the harder work to me.

I had what I thought was a hit and run incident where a woman scuffed the fk out of my car coming out of her driveway because she didn't see me. It turned into a whole confrontation at the police station but now I just don't want to deal with insurance or court dates so I'm just going to drop it. I think I can buff things out at home anyway and it's not worth the insurance increase. 

I got super upset with my obgyn office because they wouldn't refill my birth control one last time. I currently have four days left. I made an appointment with a doctor in the same medical group thinking it would be okay but it wasn't. I had to schedule an appointment at the doctor's office that's now 20+ miles away. I lost my cool on the phone and even though I apologized, I don't think they're going to refill my prescription now. 

My meds feel like they don't do anything anymore. I've been using cerebral for over a year and just cancelled my subscription because I was (miraculously) able to get a psych appointment two weeks from now at a new doctor - but I'm so scared of how it will go and of their diagnosis will align with my previous one.

I haven't been on a vacation in four years and now I may not be able to go on the small one we were trying to take at the beginning of July because someone else on my team was going to take off as well.

And those are just the big items. I can't stand it anymore. I've broken down into crying panic attacks most mornings in the last two weeks and I have no idea how to keep going. I'm worried about affording my new psych doctor, I don't think I can afford therapy, I can't afford all the other doctor and dentist visits I know I need. What's the fucking point anymore?",11,0

528,143k91f,Struggling," I was diagnosed with bipolar II in 2020 after a hospital stay. My bipolar has mostly been depression with a very rare and short episode of mania every once in a while. It has been well controlled with meds until recently. I have been having pretty bad mood swings that include longer bouts of mania, which is new to me. I’m talking daily mood swings and insane manic episodes. Nothing extreme but it is uncomfortable because I have racing thoughts and I’m impulsive with spending and I want to talk to everyone about anything that pops into my head but I’m very lonely. I also have no outlets except the gym and I’m trying to take care of a three year old with very little time for myself. I spoke with my psychiatrist last week about changing some dosages on my current medication because I am very hesitant to change medications completely after a very bad experience with a psych many years ago (I had a bad reaction to lamictal, I thought my parents were trying to kill me and they also pulled me off of a medication I had been on for a very long time without titration sending me into withdrawals while also dealing with the side effects from the lamictal) and my main medication helps me sleep. The same hospital stay in was diagnosed bipolar was because I suddenly stopped sleeping and was awake for almost three days and I was having very serious thoughts of self harm, so medication changes scare me because I want to be able to sleep.

I began seeing a therapist about three months ago but she practices “rogerian” therapy which is basically talking to her as though she is just a friend, not a medical professional. She did kind of help with a few things but I stopped seeing her recently because I felt I wasn’t getting any  coping mechanisms from her.

So now I feel stuck. I’m having daily manic episodes and I don’t know how to deal. I have anxiety and these episodes are so much different from that so my usual tricks aren’t working. My executive disfunction is shot. I feel sick and exhausted from these wild swings. I’m not myself. Obviously I need to find a new therapist but I can’t find it in me to sit down and do this. I can’t find the time or motivation. I’m trying desperately to find balance and relax and by the time I feel slightly stable I need to take care of something like laundry or cleaning or picking up my son from school and I can’t concentrate when he’s here.

I also wake up feeling extra tired when I wake up officially to get out of bed.

I think it could be caused by my depression. I have lost interest in many things, including my hobbies. My theory is I'm not sleeping well because my mind isn't as active like it was during the spring semester.

Trazodone isn't working for me. Which sucks because it has been my go-to sleep med for two years now.

There’s a part of me that is trying desperately to distance itself from me and Im not sure why. Like I said, at my core Im authentic and I think that that’s respectable but for some reason I’ve really been questioning all of my views on everything lately and cringing at everything I say, it’s starting to feel like I’m getting mental whiplash. I don’t know if this is making sense to anyone else but it’s getting really tiring to feel so ashamed of myself for every little thought. Like, in my head every person on Earth is automatically more inherently worthy and smarter than me (but also I’m actually pretty intelligent, hardworking and not a terrible person…?) and it’s been really getting to me lately. I feel like Im on pause with pursuing anything beyond just getting through the days without having multiple meltdowns because of the narrative in my head that continuously gets disproved yet I continue believing it.

542,143misd,My Personal Theory on Bipolar,"Since my first and hopefully only manic episode, I have reflected substantially on what really sparks these types of episodes. This isn't so much a universal theory of Bipolar but this is kind of how I see it working on my end.

So I believe we are presented with themes that we are preoccupied with. True unresolved feelings and emotions.
For me, I was filled with concern over health (I have chronic illness), family issues, and having some sort of legacy.

As a result I imagined that my problems were solved. That a fictitious philanthropic family wanted to take me in and solve said problems. Every beautiful girl wanting my hand in marriage. Everyone was celebrating me as I in contrast, felt worthless.

So for me, it seems like there are certain themes and triggers that contribute to stress and when you focus on the stressful situations that don't resolve it can lead to emotional damage.

I think it varies with everyone as our brains are wired in all sorts of different ways but this was just something I thought up.

544,143c32e,Having a really hard time with insomnia,"I’m typing this right now at 5 in the morning after not sleeping since the last night. I’ve had really bad insomnia since my last depressive episode that started around early March and lasted until mid May. I’m in college, so I thought it was the stress but now that I’m in an okay mood again, my bouts of insomnia have not gone away. My psych recommended I up my anxiety/sleeping meds as well as my antipsychotic to help with the depression, but I find that I am still unable to sleep some nights or I’m up until 3-4am. 

I’m back in school for the summer, and it’s super hard to get up in the morning when I do fall asleep. I should probably email my psych again and discuss other sleeping medication options. 

It’s weird, because I’ll be super tired but also super wired and hyperfixate on researching random things all night. Is this a sign of mania or hypomania? 

I’ve only ever had one manic episode that I can recall, and that’s what caused my diagnosis. I’m just really worried, because every night I stay up all night I feel like I’m shortening my lifespan by those 24 hours I’m not sleeping lol.",3,0

I don’t know a normal baseline, I am either high or I am low. Meds keep me mellow for the most part but I hate being stuck at a job I hate that has benefits so I can support my disease. It’s not enjoyable for me. My family has suffered a lot. I co parent with my ex but when I say coparent I mean he takes his kids during his access. They come home miserable and tell me they sat in the house all day and slept or they watched movies. Everything is left up to me including appointments and  all activities and fun.

546,1431eml,Screwed up 7 years,"Built my life up for 7 years & managed despite my diagnosis hurting me to recieve an honours diploma and a degree in 2 fields educationally, maintain a stable relationship, purchase a house and have a kid. 

Had a really bad episode, very bad mixed with post-partum depression and instability with family and in the span of a year lost my house, my relationship, and had to leave my field of work. I've had bad episodes but this was my worst by far.

I'm getting therapy but it's expensive. I'm still co-parening with my ex (I have full custody right now, but dad still sees him! No courts need to be involved) and it's causing a lot of repressed feelings to spill out and a ton of grief and guilt. I think it's just hitting me.

My son crying for him isn't helping. I have financial stability and am working full-time and am going back to school to further education but there's a lot of things unresolved in my past relationship occasionally spilling over the surface. 

I've suggested family therapy but he's stated he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't think he wants to (we had been together for 6 years). I can hear the sadness in his voice one second and then the next no emotion. He's been understanding in the aspect of  supporting me with living accommodations and putting himself second, but he's only been moved out/away for 2 months. 

He says he hates me? But then today was willing to have a conversation about life. I don't freaking know. 

 But I know our awful communication will affect our son long-term & my state of well-being and I'm just trying to back on track to give my son a healthy life.  

Unsure how to cope with guilt/grief to this degree with this diagnosis and could use advice because therapy's a little expensive to be asking at this point. 

I've apologized to people I hurt for the entirety of the year & have made ammends with whom I can and have tried to get things back on track. I acknowledge I'm responsible for decisions I made or did not, I just wish I could explain that wasn't my normal self.

I felt the decline before it happened and I communicated to loved-ones but I received a lot of them brushing it off as I had been ""stable"" for a long time. But COVID isolation & giving birth triggered a lot. 

But I'm starting to randomly have bad anxiety attacks and I think it's over unresolved issues with my previous partner. I'm starting to realize maybe I've been in shock. 

It's like I'm just now grieving the entire ordeal and I've been suppressing it? 

I feel like I want to isolate from everyone in my life for various reasons and I know that's not healthy. 

I think I'm starting to decline again but unsure how to prevent it. I just want stability accross the board.",16,0

My boredom feels extreme. Sometimes painful even.

I find it hard to focus. Both my psychiatrist and therapist agree I'm dealing with executive dysfunction. Which makes some of my hobbies like reading or writing creatively even harder to do.

Everyday I wake up in hopes today will be different. That I will feel better. I get disappointed everytime. But I can only hope.

Perhaps I need a medication change or adjustment? I see my psychiatrist next week about it. But until then I don't know what to do to make the week more bearable.

When these happen, it’s like I’m panicking and filled with doom and worry, but I also don’t feel like myself at all, it feels like I’m dead inside, I can’t work, I have trouble understanding anything. How I feel better is by taking some seroquel and sleeping. When I wake up I’m back to normal. 

Basically though it has come to my attention that these episodes happen bc of stress— it’s like a flee or dissociative response to stress instead of fight or flight.

Once we had submitted them, my teacher was going through the responses and stopped the class and said, we should all be kind because someone here has thought of suicide more than once. Everyone looked around cautiously while she talked and I remember looking down while she talked and when I looked up I realized everyone else was looking around trying to see who it might be. I quickly pretended to do the same. I don’t think anyone caught on.

I’d been the “smart” kid since I before I could remember and held small leadership roles for my grade. I don’t think anyone ever suspected it was me.

Before that day in class, I’d always had ambiguous thoughts of disappearing or just wishing I didn’t live.

When did others realize that most people don’t wish they weren’t alive for (more or less) every day of their life?

So yes, at first I was just angry given how she also kept telling me Lithium can't make you sluggish while it very much can since it's written literally everywhere and it did when she had given me a higher dose but now that it's lower and with prolonged release instead of popping 2 pills I voiced some concerns and she just ignored them

I'm not scared but I'm starting to think maybe I'm just imagining not being able to sleep and feeling elated, just like I did when I had suspicions of being bipolar before getting diagnosed. I don't spend a lot, sure I'm on a limited budget being a full time student living with my parents so who knows what I'd do with unsupervised access to larger quantities of money, but I mean how far does the ""everyone has it different"" thing go?

I was diagnosed by a therapist years ago as bipolar 2 but didn't put any stock into it due to some complications I had with that therapist. I hit a really low point in my life last summer and decided to find a psychiatrist and get some help. 

This new doctor had my try lots of anti depressant medications which all ended up making me extremely agitated and short with people. My new doctor believes I am bipolar 1 and was going through mania for about 3-4 months. (attempted to change everything about my life, changed jobs, fasted for hours daily to cut weight and running 5 miles every day, was running at 100mph and was just awful to people) 

As of today I am lithium carbonate and have been on it for about 3 months. I feel really well balanced and even have heard from family how different I seem. 

My problem is I can't sleep, I fall asleep and get about an hour but wake up every single night with leg tics and fight to go back to sleep.

Ive expressed this to my doctor and was prescribed Ativan for sleep. I don't want to take this drug because I know how habit forming it is but last night I cave and took one. It relaxed me but I still just could not get to sleep. I spoke with my doctor today and she suggested putting me back on nortriptyline which was a drug I was taking when she says I was experiencing mania, I don't know why this was suggested.. 

As a child I was diagnosed with tourrette syndrome and struggled immensely. When I was in my 20s my tics subsided for the most part but my mood swings were all over the place. I've tried many SSRIs and tricyclic medicines but I've never felt as balanced as I do on the lithium.

572,142wled,"Folks with bipolar, did you have to adjust to your medicated self?/How did your lifestyle change once you got on medication?","I am 21F, diagnosed bipolar I a year ago, but I have had symptoms since late childhood/early teens. Before adulthood I experienced typical and awful bouts of depression, where I got barely anything done and was able to do well in school just by being a smart slacker, interspersed with periods of (hypo)mania where I would sleep much less, feel euphoric and productive, and get a fuck ton done... even as a teen I'd feel so inspired/creative and in my own head that I'd write heaps, some of which became national prize-winning stuff, or published work. So I kind of fell into this cycle of doing absolutely nothing when depressed and then just waiting for the mania/hypomania to kick in so that I could rapidly catch up on everything and be my ""normal"" self, frontloading work and accomplishments before the depression inevitably hit again.

Now, as an adult, this has made me incredibly unhealthy. Before ""doing nothing when depressed"" just meant playing videogames and crying in my room and just coming out for dinner; now it means substance abuse (weed and cigarettes), dirty laundry piling up everywhere, plates that need to be cleaned, bills that I am late on...

I don't even ""catch up on life"" when manic anymore, my thoughts move too fast and the euphoria is too intense for me to get much done, and all bets are off obviously if I become psychotic/manic manic. I also have ADHD that is also way more destructive in adulthood than it was when I was younger, and it's difficult to focus hypo/manic energy into productivity much of the time. Now I just spend a lot, go on a lot of walks/runs (lol), and make embarrassing posts on social media...

I feel like I spend all of the time inside my head, either trying to numb the pain or just trying to ride the waves. I've been on medication for 6 months and it has helped. My moods are much more even and I feel way more ""normal"". I am glad to not be psychotic or suicidal. But everything feels less exciting, for one... not in a good or bad way, just objectively. Life is more predictable now. More stable, and that's good. But less exciting.

And also, the fact that I have built my entire personality and living habits around having these extreme and unpredictable shifts in mood. I am glad that I can let go of those habits now, but I'm not quite sure that I know how. I've never had a ""healthy""/stable approach to life, and have very few healthy habits and don't know how to start building them. I don't know how to start working on things at a steady, even and predictable pace, I don't know how to gently manage my life in a sustainable way, that's never been me. I feel still like I'm waiting for something to happen, for me to get super depressed, or better, super high and manic so that I can ""start"" doing stuff. Has anyone else experienced this?

All of a sudden, it became commonplace for me to be the ""psycho"" and ""crazy"" person all because of my diagnosis and that gave him the ""power"" to abuse me even more. I feel like a fool, maybe I really am. I have absolutely no self confidence now and I have no hope for humanity. Has anyone else been through the ringer with an abusive partner and never thought you'd see the light? I hate that having this disorder makes me dwell and fixate on the worst things about a person I love even though a part of me wants to think otherwise. Sorry, I'm all over the place but I have no one right now and I think that's what best. Most people just try to take advantage of me and I don't even know what or who I am anymore. I've given up on trying to talk to new people because I just scare them off. I'm just a joke and I can't help but feel like even my therapist is sick and tired of me talking about the same exact thing, every single session. I'm absolutely sick of people telling me to just get up and go on and to find my worth. I'm afraid at such a young age, I'm deep in the pits and can never get out. I'm not even trying to get attention or wanting a permanent solution.. I'm just used to the monotony of hating myself and wanting things to go back with this horrible person. 


How do I, once and for all, eradicate this horrible fixation I have for this person that took all my trust and left me in smithereens.

The reason I'm making this post is because I want to know if anyone else also experiences the same thing. Does anyone else go through a severe depressive episode around the same time every year without fail? For me, it's right now (early June) and if I don't actively try to pull myself out, it just progresses and gets worse. I'm talking unable to go to work and having to request time off, unable to leave bed for majority of the day, little to no appetite, shutting people out (isolating), and overall unable to take care of yourself anymore. 

It's been hard to get myself to shower, do my skincare routine, brush my teeth, and make myself food to eat. My birthday is coming up and I am going on a trip with my family this week. I have zero excitement and it's hard to look forward to things. The past years that I've been THIS low, I've had to check myself into the hospital because of hopelessness and suicidal ideation. I've spent 3 birthdays in the psych ward and this year I can't check myself in because I have this trip coming up and I still have hope that I can push through this. 

I don't know why this happens around the same time every single year. If you also experience this please let me know how you try to bring yourself out of your depressive episode.

I am wondering how you guys deal with these episodes when they roll through.

I now live with a brand new person who i consider to be my closest friend right now. i may be transferring schools as i live near a different university in our city now.

needless to say this triggered a manic episode while moving that I'm now crashing from. I'm missing work. I'm vaping more than ever.

I'm between psychiatrists right now. my old psych retired a few months ago without telling me after discharging me a year prior. i only found out because my prescription got canceled. I'm now working with my family doctor to come up with a treatment plan. I hadn't been sleeping well, hence the seroquel prescription. 

my question is whether anyone notices a difference between brand name and generic with any of these medications, but specifically abilify as generic was given to me in place of brand name around the middle of the month when i picked up my prescriptions.

I'm also wondering whether the seroquel is the best choice. I've been having terrible side effects such as blurred vision, confusion, dizziness, and feeling faint.

599,142ogdt,Is there therapy for someone traumatized by dealing with their illness alone?,"I have seen many therapists and I feel it can help but always grinds to a halt when talking about trauma. My outside life has been pretty good. I have good relationships with my family, mostly stable romantic relationships throughout my life, barely any kind of bullying growing up, a great marriage, friendsn education, talents, financial security, most people seem to like me...

My life has been better than your average person it seems. My mood disorder started around puberty and I dealt with extreme mood changes and unstable emotions, sometimes to things that I knew were inconsequential or for no reason at all.

I've come to the conclusion that my mood disorder was almost solely neurological but my anxiety stuck around. I kept quiet about my problems growing up because of the shame I felt. Everything was fine in my life, so why do I feel this way? I don't deserve help for these behaviors because maybe I'm being overly dramatic, lazy, selfish, attention seeking (even though I hid the issues as best I could and was never honest about how I felt). I was a young teen, knowing my life was average to good and feeling so confused and guilty about what I was going through. 

The last therapist I was working with did internal family systems with me. For those who dont know, its a type of therapy that recognizes and works with different parts of the self and will even talk to those parts through guided meditation. It was great therapy and I learned a lot, but she was making me feel unheard when it came to dealing with my mood disorder. She felt it was a ""part"" of me that I could speak with. 

So I did. My parts always looked like me, but my mood disorder was this horrible amorphous black haze, almost blazing like fire and would just float around like an asshole. I let it speak and the face it has was indescrible and the sounds it made still haunt me. I had the worst panic attack I had in a long time seeing that.

It had nothing to offer. It was like personifying a disease or a cancer and believing I could somehow reason with it. She kept insisting it was possible and our relationship just fell apart from there. I cried and pleaded for her to believe me, that it was the trauma of dealing with a mood disorder by myself as a child and not because of some outside force that is easily recognized or quantifiable. 

Am I alone here? I feel like all my trauma came from within and the anxiety I still deal with comes from the bad habits I acquired while working through it by myself and all the guilt I felt for feeling like my emotions and feelings were totally invalid and that I made a decision to feel that way. 

I need help but every single therapist I talk to always seem to dig for some kind of horrific event, consistent abuse, anything that could explain why I'm still dealing with anxiety. 

For context, it took a while, but with some healthy decisions and trial and error, I found a medication combination that has me fairly stable for several years (with needed tweaks here and there). But I still have issues opening up to people close to me, being honest about my well being, having shit self esteem, and my biggest issue right now is dealing with an eating disorder for the last couple years. I'm 37.

I've taken CBT and DBT classes, but most of the time I just feel triggered when taking those classes. It reminds me of all the times I've employed those techniques just to have them fail because my brain just wasn't having it and feeling horrible for ""just not trying hard enough.""

606,142h1hw,I’m so bitter towards myself," woke up this morning after about a week of falling into a mini depression (compared to how it used to get without my medication.) Im out of pot and I finished my last cigarette yesterday morning. I told myself im done smoking anything because my brain just wants to do that all day when im depressed. I also binge eat and gain like 20 pounds when I smoke pot and am depressed. Once im over the low spells, I quickly try to loose the weight and do so successfully in about a month in a half. 

The pattern has been my life. Im 25 and have been doing this long before I knew I had bipolar, it started when I was like 17. I would go through Taco Bell and order like 8 things on the menu and just smoke out and eat it all in one sitting then go to the next place and do it there. I would then obsessively run to loose weight while literally taking cigarette breaks. This was before I was medicated so this was how I almost tuned out of the world with my bad habits 

I went about a year without doing this but recently I just randomly started doing all that I described again. I have been medicated and my brain has been feeling probably 40% better than it ever has. That difference makes the pain feel more like the normal and the more stable times feel more boring. 

I don’t know. I wanted to rant. I know all of this is better than having a drug or alcohol problem but it just hurts. What I am saying is that I woke up and realized that I think I do this still to this day because I’m bitter of all the time I’ve lost to this illness. Im bitter with how it feels like the youth I could have had was robbed from me by some unpredictable illness. I think I hold onto these coping mechanisms of self destruction because I subconsciously feel I have no choice but to be this way because I don’t deserve anything more.

General paranoia that something bad is going to happen to me, that friends and family are out to get me/doing bad things to me behind my back, that everyone in my life is going to find out how stupid I really am and I’ll lose everything. Just to name a few examples. 

This only gets worse when I’m going through difficult circumstances in my life… ie. a recent breakup. I have really outrageous thoughts that are all driven by paranoia about this person doing things to harm me emotionally/psychologically. 

I also have a lot of trauma (especially with this particular person) so the paranoia could also stem from that….

Just thought I’d share my experience and see how everyone copes if they are going through the same thing. :)",3,0
614,142gw21,Do delusional thoughts ever really stop?,"24/M diagnosed 3 years ago after my first manic episode. I stopped taking the medication after a year and moved in with my girlfriend. Everything was fine for a while but in January I had a gut feeling she was cheating on me. I couldn't ignore it, I checked her phone and found texts with her boss..they were all very normal texts and nothing concerning at all. but in my mind they were confirmation of cheating. I freaked out and scared her really bad..I had to go back on abilify and lithium. I've been back on it for 16 weeks now but I still can't stop thinking that she is cheating on me, even though she stayed with me and forgave me for what I put her through. it's like one part of my mind says no this is wrong, stop. And the other 90% of my brain is obsessed and constantly desperate to confront her about it, constantly angry..I'm in therapy but the coping methods don't seem to help this and I'm scared to increase dose because the side effects are rough..but I don't want to ruin the relationship I have..thoughts?

627,1424q20,Depakote- managing weight,"Hi Everyone,

I am curious to know if anyone has had success managing their weight on depakote? 

After trying many meds over the years Depakote seems like my best option. I was on lithium for over three years and while it was amazing it caused me to break out in severe acne. 

I haven’t found a medication that made me feel like lithium did until I started taking depakote. I am so hungry all the time and I’m not sure what to do. As much as I felt the weight gain would be better than the acne, I’m not so sure anymore. It’s really bothering me how I can’t seem to stop eating. I’m honestly tired of being on medications at this point. 

Part of me just wants to stop taking them completely and see what happens. But I know all too well that it’s  probably not a good idea. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is if depakote worked well for you were you able find a way to manage your weight? Sugar cravings?

I’m also on seroquel and Zoloft, but depakote was added most recently.

So today I had an appointment for an ADHD evaluation. I was diagnosed with it as a child but we never got deeper into it. As I had to see a psychiatrist to renew my medication, I decided to do a full test to see what type of ADHD I have and bla bla bla. 

After the 3 hour meeting where I answered a lot of questions about my past, my current life... The psychiatrist told me that I was indeed ADHD, but the main problem was that I am bipolar type 2. My first reaction was to say ""well, I don’t think so"". My mother is bipolar and all my life I've tried not to be like her, so this diagnosis really turned me upside down. 

Since I don't have depressive episodes, I've tried to challenge her because for me it doesn't make sense to be bipolar if all I get are highs and moments of joy that are too intense (which I thought were due to ADHD) but she says that it can happen in some people. 

She doesn't want to renew my Concerta prescription, saying she's too afraid my bipolarity will cause a manic episode. So she wants me to take Lamotrigine for 3 months and then she'll put me back on Concerta.

661,1423re4,Sodium Valproate? I’m desperate for info on this,"I’ll try to make this as brief as possible. Thanks for reading X 

I’ve been on over 10 or 11 medications mostly antidepressants. Ever since Zoloft stopped working for me in 2018. I was trialed on Lamictal but it didn’t work and each time I’m put on an anti-depressant, I become agitated, restless, and I don’t really get much of a mood lift.
When I come off them, I feel better for a week or two before my mood goes down. My main issue is depression and anxiety. I may have manic like symptoms, but that seems to be antidepressants induced.

My psych now wants to put me on sodium valproate, and at this point I’m just resigned to going along with it because I’ve lost hope with a lot of other things.

Anyone out there who has responded well to this, especially for depression and anxiety? I see that it works on GABA receptors, and that makes me think it will be good for my anxiety, and perhaps that may lift my mood.

I even got the genesight testing done to see if there was a reason I had an awful reaction to some- nothing. It shows that everything should react fine with my body. 

I hate the med trials, errors, dose changes, and the very frequent appointments. I hate that my kids have a “crazy” mom. I hate that my mental illness might traumatize them.

I know the basic rundown from experience, or the idea that medication is the only way to treat the thing and that it will get dark without it. Gliding back gently to earth naturally seems to be a pipe dream (although I'm sure it's happened to somebody). However, I've been hyper-controlled on the 'good' early portion of things, although I have had the symptoms -- shopping sprees, but this time restrained to clothes I was already going to buy; successfully seducing just about any woman I talk to, but this time not taking things any further than a little flirting; very little need for food or sleep, so forcing myself; walking all over town, but in a health-conscious rather than vagabond kind of way this time.

Friday: 

1. Was diagnosed with diabetes. Have been gaining weight and feeling awful so my doctor checked my blood for diabetes and, positive. 

2. Also was told I most likely have pancreatitis and they need further testing Monday. 


Saturday:

1. Drama between some close friends

2. I caught my children in a very inappropriate position that made it seem like my son (7) was sexually abusing my daughter (3). I was a victim of CSA so this triggered the fuck out of me. After some questioning my son never touched her, but they were still being inappropriate. 

3. My dog ate a 6-8” corn on the cob (and my entire dinner because I couldn’t eat because of #2) and I’m now at the emergency vet hoping that they can get him to puke it up so they don’t need to do surgery.

Pressured speech impacts a ton of the conversation ones, racing thoughts the distractibility. Psychomotor agitation for fidgeting. Hypomania for social ones, hell even mania for pattern recognition and imagination and relationship, attraction ones….

Long story short, I scored “on spectrum” and “probably” for ADHD, even with being 100% honest and purposefully answering neurotypical for many. It was very clear having bipolar influenced many of those that could indicate the opposite.

Decorated is life

On bare stems 

Of trees that grow in the most hostile of places

775,13zmqau,Still struggling w lost/broken relationships from mania,"My first and only mania happened about 2 years ago. Among other things, during it I rampaged through my phone and email contacts sending a lot of cruel (and, often, painfully true) messages to my friends and relatives. Some worse than others.

In so many ways this experience has actually been a blessing and has sorted my relations in a clear way. Many people immediately forgave me and said, ""I knew it wasn't you."" The relationships that made it through this experience became extremely concretized.

On the other hand, there are others who don't really understand, or got too hurt because what I said was just too far in those instances, or for other reasons.

I still struggle two years out because two of the relationships I lost were two women I considered to be my very best friends. One of them actually just completely ghosted me, never responded to anything, and that was that. It is so hard with her because she is still friends with my sister and they socialize every few months. (My sis says they don't talk about me...which I'm not sure if that makes me feel better or worse). My relationship with my sis is sort of ok, but also feels really damaged because I can't get over the fact that she is chilling with this traitor. For more context the friend was my BFF since 1st grade. My sister only got to know her as a friend in adulthood.

The other friend I lost is diagnosed Bipolar 2. (I'm obviously 1 bc I've had mania). We talked some when I first got out of the hospital, which I appreciated. She said we didn't need to immediately discuss what went down when I was manic bc she just wanted to make sure I was ok. (A kindness the first friend didn't give me, which is shocking and makes me 100% sure it's right she's out of my life....more just tortured that she is friends w my sis). However, once we did start talking I felt that she was extremely defensive and not willing to understand even a crack of my experience or how it could be excused by being completely and utterly out of my mind. Even though she is bp2 and has only had hypomania she said, ""I've had mania before. Several times. Not as intense as yours but I do understand."" This as a way to basically shut me down when I said, ""it just seems like you're not understanding the nature of mania."" I'm frustrated with her for that. I've been hypomanic several times and it is just night and day, the difference, basically not comparable. It was insulting that she said that to me and makes me so mad. I didn't tell her this, I was just kinda like, ""I hear you, and again I am sorry..."" kind of thing. After that conversation I sent her a nice gift in the mail - a brand new sweater and some art supplies and treats for her new cat. She did not acknowledge the gift at all, though I saw she picked it up from the post office. I also sent another email trying to explain more that she did not respond to.

I have such a lack of respect for the just ghosting response. Why can't people say, ""I don't want to talk to you anymore"" or ""I don't want to talk to you now,"" ...and ideally like, ""thanks for trying to reach out / thanks for the $200 gift.""

I am at a point where I am for various reasons including things from before mania, glad that these friends are not in my life anymore. At the same time, it upsets me and causes me emotional disturbance frequently. I am also really mad at my sister for hanging out with my friend.

I am working to walk away and leave it behind me, focus on the many great relationships and opportunities I do have in the present and future. But still. Does anyone have any advice on how I can process this to better move past it, or can relate? The second friend who ghosted me after sending the gift and email I wonder if I should write her again or even call and just be like....""So I just wanted the closure and this is goodbye"" or if I should let her weak, bitch-ass, cowardly response speak for itself.

781,13zz1ls,"Bipolar II, BPD, just unrelenting anxiety and codependency? Who knows, but I'm hoping to share my experience. TW: substance abuse","For pretty much all my life, I've dealt with chronic anxiety. From tummy aches and nightmares as a toddler, to dissociation and panic attacks in my early 20's. I was much more depressed in high school and struggled with a lot of substance abuse. I got some relief when I started college, mainly just because I felt more free and independent. But that's when my struggle with relationships started. 

As concisely as I can put it, I take on the caregiver role very quickly. (I'd like note however that every guy I've dated ended up having severe self-esteem issues and depression.) I would grow to believe I was truly better and smarter than my partner, but that didn't stop my unrelenting anxiety that they would leave me. If they argued with me, said goodnight the wrong way, or maybe just changed their tone in one single sentence - I took it as all out war. I felt abandoned, hurt, attacked, and I would look for every means of escape and every way to get back at them. I would say things I didn't really mean just for the sake of trying to hurt them. I felt trapped inside this horrible monstrous person that didn't feel like me, but it was, wasn't it? Then when it was all said and done, I had no doubts about us. Everything would work out just fine, no matter what came our way. Rinse and repeat. This still goes on even in my current relationship, but to a lesser degree as I'm working on communication skills more actively.

After my last relationship ended (which was pretty mutual), it sent me into becoming a person I didn't know existed. I felt so good about myself, but also felt everything I did was out of my control. I was partying and drinking every night, meeting and hooking up with random people on the internet, sabotaging friendships for no reason, and hardly sleeping. This went on for the better part of 3 months, and then I just..stopped. No depression after, just went back to being normal. This is the closest thing I can think of to ever feeling hypomanic.

When it comes to medications, I tried a ton as a teenager. I was trialed on Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor, and Paxil. Nothing ever did anything for me except give me brain fog. I decided to try Zoloft again a few months ago, and the experience could not have been more different. For two weeks, I felt I was on cloud nine. Everything was better, I was happy, lifted, as close as I could get to euphoric without feeling actually high. Two weeks later, I crashed so hard and spent the entire night telling my boyfriend how I was losing my sense of identity and nothing would ever be better. Then the next day, I was mostly okay, but decided to come off the medication. 

My new psychiatrist says the reaction to Zoloft is an early indicator of bipolar II. She explained that for bipolar, SSRIs immensely exacerbate the highs and lows. Even if I don't experience the intense swaying of moods over long periods of time, she said as a 23 year old female it's pretty much just a matter of time. So I got started on Lamictal, still at the baby dose of 25mg but slowly moving up to 100mg as I adjust. I see so many people on here talk about their unrelenting depression, but I really don't experience it yet. I go a few days feeling good, maybe a few more being super anxious, but I feel my mood swings are a few hours to hours or day to day rather than weeks. Just curious if anyone else is similar.

785,13zxkre,Recurring dreams,"TLDR: Can an “anxiety dream” that hasn’t been present in 20+ years come back and be a sign of a pending spiral? I’m going through a difficult, but stable time. 

I’m currently stable, however I’m dealing with some fairly significant stress at work and home. I’m coping fairly well. However, last night I had a dream that I ONLY have in times in my life when things are starting to spiral. The dream is that I’m driving and I can’t see and it’s out of control. Nothing catastrophic actually happens. I happen to get to a point where I can acknowledge it’s a dream and force myself to wake up. This is the first time in years, but other times were frequently 24 years ago when I was drinking too much (22). I grew out of that, but used to have bouts of binge drinking during episodes. In the last 5 years I drink a couple of beers twice a year. I’m currently not using any substances.

786,13zxe6s,"New manager made me cry. Do I tell her boss (my former boss and mentor) about the interaction, or let it go?","I've been working at my current job in the non-profit sector for nearly 5 years, and for the most part it has been a dream job. I had an awesome boss, great relations with my team, and truly feel like my work makes a difference and matters. Even when I  had a manic episode last year (with psychotic features) my boss was super supportive, kept my confidence about it and didn't make me feel judged at all. I will always be grateful.

If only things could stay that way.

As my boss is at a director level, we recently hired a new manager to help and I had my reservations when it was announced. But after thinking it through and discussing with my therapist, decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and hoped we'd get along and maybe become friends (everyone at my org is very passionate about the work we do, and I hoped we could bond over this).

Because I've been at the organization for so long, I naturally had my own networks and ways of doing things. I've also continued to discuss my projects with my former boss for the most part because we've always worked closely on these items in the past. For a while, it was just him and I. I'll admit I was also a bit intimidated by the new hire because she has a very direct, blunt management style and I was still feeling her out. But I've been friendly and even invited her out to lunch to get to know one another, and I thought it went well. 

We had a 1-on-1 call last week, which I prepared for under the impression we were to discuss our working relationship and ways she could support me as the new manager. I began our call with my typical friendly chit-chat and was immediately cut off.

She then proceeded to tell me, in no uncertain terms, that she found me to be ""disrespectful"" and having an authoritarian attitude (she's been her about a month). Her evidence was that I hadn't been checking in with her enough frequently (I've always had a certain level of autonomy, but had been CCing her on big projects) and she wasn't happy that I had used our online system to request a day off (after working the equivalent in overtime hours) rather than seek permission from her directly. Fair enough? While I can understand her perspective as a new manager, I felt it was handled very poorly.

I'm not proud, but I was completely blindsided by these accusations and immediately burst into tears on the call. I thought I had gone out of my way to embrace her as a team member and help bring her up to speed on my key projects. I have always been nothing but friendly and kind, and have always thought of myself as a team player.

She also told me, going forward I am not to communicate with my former boss, ever, and only go through her. IF he needs to be made aware of something, she'll bring it up to him. I'm to stop all contact.

Obviously, this is also distressing. He's been an incredible support and mentor and now knows my mental health history. After my disastrous call (in which she watched me breakdown with no reaction but total distain for my emotions) I feel at a loss of what to do. 

I definitely don't feel comfortable sharing my diagnosis with the new manager, and now dread our interactions. It also seems to be me she's targeting and not the other staff (who are also relatively newer compared to me). 

A part of me really wants to reach out to my former boss (her boss) and share what happened on the call. I've been obsessing over her use of words ""disrespectful"" and ""authoritarian"" and want to know if he's ever heard of other staff ever describing me like that. But I don't want to burden him, or feel like I'm ""tattling"" on her, so I haven't said anything.

I did call HR immediately after the call because I was near sobbing at how cruel she seemed on the call, and needed help processing. I didn't know what to do. I was so hurt and upset. I'm scared everything is going to change now at work and I feel cut off from my biggest professional support and mentor.

789,13zpxo2,Am I Doing Alright? You let me know,"Hi all! So it's been a while. I was institutionalized following a failed attempt, put on meds, did outpatient treatment for a year THEN my therapist died - I stopped medication for 6 months then I suffered a ""stress induced"" blackout - tried therapy again for about 3 sessions and I've been rawdogging life ever since. That was 2 years ago.

So since then I've gotten really self aware with my moods, my emotions, my episodes and how to 'manage' them. A lot changed - went from surviving to living (toxic positivity gets the job done sometimes) but I was numb. 

I couldn't cry, for close to year. Even when I was in the thick of the shit - that little moment before I couldn't recondition the terrible feeling away, I couldn't cry - nothing. The really good moments were just okay.

Until the past 3 weeks. Where I went from breaking down in tears out of the blue in an office meeting at 9am to having the literal time of my life at festivals and parties with other people and by myself and I mean I was euphoric - like that moment was the happiest I've ever and will ever be & if that is so I will be okay because I had the time of my life.

This past week, I was not well(flu)and not going to work. Wednesday I was preparing to go back into the office and I got triggered by the tiniest non -issue and a had a full breakdown.

By that I mean fetal position, rolling panick attacks that lasted around 10hours and I went mute. I haven't had panick attacks that severe ever and only a few in the past 3 years. The last time I went mute was 5/6 years ago.

I went to the riverside when the attacks ended.... rationalized and explained everything that happened (to myself)- I thought about committing myself to the psych ward for a bit & let that thought go. Thursday, I spent half the day at the office in a constant state of panick/anxiety then found out my beloved friend lost his battle with depression and I went to Karaoke.

At Karaoke, I had THE TIME OF MY LIFE. And I was really sad and terribly drunk - I was feeling EVERYTHING! my emotions,  everybody's emotions - I cried to my ex who broke my heart terribly and after I cried in his arms because I was sad my friend died and I was feeling so much... I was okay. Like I have never felt sadness before in my life. I let a stranger walk me to my car, I got home, slept and woke up to find I had wet the bed. 

And I spent a shit ton of money at karaoke.

But I'm okay now. The sadness of my friends death comes in crashing waves. But I'm okay.

What do you think... should I make the call to the psych ward?

(P.S The funniest part is - for the 2 years I was 'okay', I was okay and dealing with the fact that I was misdiagnosed and had been faking this illness for the past 15 years and worked on healing whatever traits of manipulation or narcissism or trauma that would make me fake bipolar and mental illness or at least have me convince myself and others that l was ill. And guess what - I healed through that too. Made a lot of progress. I was okay.)",3,0

792,13zbl3w,How do you decide if past experiences were hypomania or you just doing weird stuff?,"I'm pending a diagnosis at the moment, and it's got me thinking back through the past few years and looking at things in a more critical light, but there are some grey areas where I can't tell if things I did were just bold or uncharacteristic of me or if they were related to hypomania. 

I'm posting here because I imagine a lot of you can relate to this feeling, whatever the reason is you're looking back, and I'd really appreciate some advice on how you sort it in your own mind. 

Personally, there are times lately that were clearly 'wrong' to me and led me to speak to my doctor. When I look back, before I had that awareness, there are a few big moments that stand out to me as making unusually poor decisions with money without worrying about it, starting uncharacteristic projects, that kind of thing, always when feeling 'not depressed', but I can't recall my energy levels or amount of sleep, etc., because they're a few years in the past and nothing drew my attention to those kinds of flags. I think that alone is enough to make me think they were 'me' and just normal, weird parts of life and being a young adult that I'll never repeat, but I guess I'll never quite know.

It was amazing but I realized I work at my desk most of the day with noise cancelling headphones so I often missed the reminder from my phone. 

I ended up looking for an extension for google chrome and found one called Water Reminder. It gives me a singular notification sound (no overstimulation from repeated noises) and a message every 30 minutes.

818,13z2jfi,"Recently diagnosed, need advice","I’ve had mental health issues going back 25 years, probably longer. They really accelerated last year when I started having regular hyper manic episodes after been put on Stertaline for ‘acute anxiety disorder/PTSD’ I knew it wasn’t anxiety alone but it took me nearly losing myself and everything and everyone around me before I was referred to the mental health team. I’ve been diagnosed in the last week with bipolar 2, BPD and ADHD, the ADHD I had long suspected but the other two were a shock. I’m currently on quetiapine and melatonin but reducing both as I was struggling to function, gained olds of weight and unable to manage my job, even at reduced hours or look after my child properly. She’s only just turned 2.  The NHS psychiatrist recently started to think I was mostly suffering from anxiety and ADHD again last month so I used my work health insurance for a second opinion and the above diagnosis is what she landed on. She’s switching me to Lamotrigine. I’m nervous about this, I’ve been on 6 different medications in the last year and none of them have worked for me past the 3 month where my mind/body seems to rebel against them and I end up very sick. I need to keep my job, work have been surprisingly supportive and given my access to a mental health fund and allowed my to create a role that suits me in my professional function. But I’m very aware my brain is mush. I’m struggling to take on new information. I’m finding certain subjects and platforms really challenging, eg maths,  fucking Excel! I’ve literally been arguing with my partner over his desire to me to put things into an Excel spreadsheet and get to relearn it. Ffs, my brain has zero internet and trying to make me do it is frustrating for everyone. I’m struggling to be social as trying to ‘be normal’ is exhausting. I’m afraid to drink alcohol as when I was hyper manic I was drinking, smoking not eating properly or sleeping yet had no realisation to what extreme. Also online shopping for all sorts of odd things. When I’m stable I have no desire to smoke or drink the way I was drinking, alcohol I can take or leave until I’m getting hyper and then it’s like I down it like water but don’t realise that is what I’m doing at the time.  I don’t know if I genuinely have an alcohol probably or I develop one due to my state of mind but I’ve been going to meeting regardless to make sense of it. 
I haven’t spoken to my family about my diagnosis or events in the last year. Sort from mother and partner, no one knows the extend of trauma I had growing up. With therapy, I’m pretty sure the starting point for BP and BPD was due to sexual abuse when I was very young. My mother was aware but didn’t take appropriate action or protect me, I thought it was my fault for a very long time and also have been hiding it out of shame because she drummed into me that no one would believe and I must have done something to encourage it. I have confronted her about this. Still, the damage is still there, if anything, the birth of my own daughter in 2021 seemed to drag all my demons out. 
Apologises this is so long. Essentially I’ve been working so so hard to get better but I feel with every step forward I go further down a rabbit hole. My life plans seem out of reach, I hate the zombie I’ve become on medication. Despite my partners support I feel very isolated snd I’m terrified of having another episode.

Now my relationship with my mom is better than it's ever been, and that is awesome. 

I feel much more spiritually connected to the world than I used to. I have bipolar with delusional tendencies, and the delusions I have while manic are mostly of a spiritual nature. I honestly feel much more at home in the world with this spiritual connection I found through bipolar disorder. 

I'm actually a much better writer than I used to be because of bipolar. I keep a daily journal tracking my mood, energy, mentality, just how I'm feeling and what's going on. Through the years it's evolved from being basic and barebones into being fullblown personal discussions with myself. I feel I have a much more developed sense of self-awarness because of it, and I owe it to being bipolar. 

I'm not saying bipolar is easy, it is a daily struggle for me. But at this point I've found a certain sense of beauty in the struggle of it, and I do believe I'm a stronger and more resilient person because of being bipolar.

829,13yxu4k,Am I just hypomanic and being paranoid? I’m afraid that the people at my car’s dealership snooped through my backpack when I was out of the room. Should I call them to see if they’ll let me review the security cameras?,"Today I went to pick up my car, which has been at the dealership for a month. I sat with the customer service manager in his office (a conjoined desk next to another conjoined desk and a side office), and waited for my parents (who helped pay for the service) to send paperwork. 

I had my backpack, and since it was the end of the day, I put it in an empty seat next to me. 

When the paperwork was sent, he told me to follow him to the front office to get checked out. I went to grab my backpack, but he said that I didn’t have to; that it would only take a few minutes and we’d be right back. I was hesitant, but said ok. At this point, there were no customers in the back of the office, just a few customer service managers and other employees (all of whom were ready to go home).

The checkout process ended up taking longer than was anticipated, because my parents’ card had issues. The manager I’d been working with eventually said he was going back to the office (where my backpack was) to “take care of some things” — likely whatever it was he needed to do before the dealership closed.

I ended up waiting to be checked out for about 20 minutes. That whole time, I had this gnawing paranoia about my backpack being snooped through because I’d left it unattended. 

(Also, as a side note, I could tell that the consensus among the employees was that I was a “daddy’s money” person — which isn’t even the truth — and I could feel the glares they hid under customer service smiles/voices.)

Anyway, I finished, went back to my backpack, and left. 

The reason I am so worried is that I had 2 journals in my backpack, each of which contains very personal entries. Even though everyone there seemed “professional,” and were undoubtedly just thinking about going home, I feel so stupid for leaving the backpack unattended.

My only solace are the facts that 1) when I later opened my backpack, I saw that the journals had been in the same (particular) position I had put them in, and 2) there were cameras pointed directly at my where my backpack was.

I looked up the dealership on Google, and they have a lot of 1 star reviews (despite being rated 4.5+ stars overall), although most of the bad reviews were about bad customer service and gouged prices.

So, what do you guys think? Should I call them to see if I can review the security camera?",2,0

I miss the mural that's been painted over on the building downtown, and the Indian restaurant that closed, and my good friend who worked at the bookstore who moved up North.

I don't know how to feel and I don't know how to deal with the fallout of the episode, as I also experienced some hallucinations/psychosis symptoms that have significantly alienated me from peopl in my life especially family. 

I'm staying with my dad now but feel really icky about everything because during the episode, my actions caused some trauma in the lives of those two and I don't know how to make amends in an appropriate way because I don't want to use the pending diagnosis as an excuse and also I don't think that me attempting to make amends will help them in the long run so I will just take a step back and let them decide how they want to handle it. Honestly my sense of identity seemed so sure during the episode but now that it's over and I'm looking at the carnage and the therapist said it was likely bipolar I don't really know who I am or what kind of person I am anymore. 

I was sometimes curious about the possibility of a mood disorder when I was in high school but having a professional tell me it's likely feels like a whole nother story, as well as seeing the carnage unfold. I've never really done anything like this before - stealing my housemates things because I was sure they were secretly mine/sure that that housemate had it out for me and had done terrible things to me with no evidence. A lot of thieving and having angry, screaming outbursts in the streets over perceived slights as well as having some sort of delusion that that would solve world crises. 

I was convinced that everything I was doing was for some perceived righteous cause and that everyone pushing against me were trying to silence me as some sort of conspiracy. I got banned from my old college campus and sent to a therapists office, but then I just took my umpulsive crime spree elsewhere and got arrested twice - one for setting a fire on the highway, and one for setting onein the rental property of my front yard. It sounds ridiculous now but at the time it made sense. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do with my life. I completely blew everything up and I know it's my fault but I can't fathom for the life of me what the fuck came over me. Where does the sickness (if it's bipolar) end and I begin? How do I bounce back from the consequences? I'm embarassed and ashamed and every morning I wake up and feel depressed and anxious over all this stuff. As I should, I guess. It feels like a righteous karmic principle that I should be in this situation after my actions, especially considering that my former housemate may end up having trust issues over the stealing and privacy invading.

I've been asking myself that question a lot lately. I keep hearing that it gets better, things work out, I just have to keep a positive outlook and find the right meds. But I feel utterly hopeless. My doctors say the meds are working. I don't really feel different, but I've told them that my anxiety meds work for temporary situations. Yet I keep falling into depression over and over again. I feel like the mood stabilisers haven't made me any more stable.

This disorder has taken so much from me that I feel completely useless. Worthless. Meaningless. I'm terrified of the future because I'm in uni and I can't even study right now. I got put on sick leave for three months and it could be extended. I feel unable to study, let alone work, the thought of any of that stuff makes me extremely anxious. I live with my boyfriend and I dread being alone because I don't trust myself.

People say I just need to find something to drive me, a goal or something of the sort. But I have nothing - absolutely nothing - that interests me. And I'm not good at anything. I have no hobbies or skills that could support me financially and make me feel content at the same time. I've convinced myself that I can't do anything and it feels true.

It's probably just the depression talking. I'm diagnosed with BPD as well and I've heard that depression goes unusually deep for us and very quickly so, which I can relate to. But it's been 10 years of the same thing. And I've never felt life without anxiety. I stopped to think about that today, and it really hit me. Lately, everything seems to hit me again and again. The reality of it all. I grew up with severe social anxiety disorder and plummeted into depression at around 12 years old. I'm about to turn 22 and I'm still in the same situation while the ones I used to relate to and get support from all seem to have ""moved on"". It feels like my mindset is still stuck in 2013.

I fear I won't make it another year. I'm overwhelmed. When I was a kid I used to think 26 would be the end for me, because I was terrified of living any longer than that. Now I'm worse than ever.

Do you guys relate? Has it gotten better for any of you? What do you do in situations like these?",2,0
847,13ya75s,"marriage, pregnancy, meds","Hi friends, I have bp1 w a history of psychosis (amongst other things/illnesses as well)

1 month ago I got married (!!!) and about 6 months ago I started working with my psychiatrist on med options that would allow me to have children with the least amount of risk while allowing me to not be off the rails lol. 

I was originally on vraylar and a heck ton of lithium for a long time. After a lot of adjusting, it’s just me and my 450mg of lithium BID…and I feel ok!! 

The plan my psychiatrist suggested that I agreed to was to discontinue lithium for the first trimester, either being unmedicated or adding an atypical antipsychotic for that time period. Then after the first trimester, resume just the lithium. 

I know different med combinations work for different people, and I’d be curious if others here have been pregnant either while unmedicated or medicated and what it was like. Tbh I’m terrified lol

This time, she said I was the more stable she has ever saw me.
And then we talked about that borderline stuff. She said she thinks I got some borderline characteristics.
She explained me some differences between both disorders, and I went like ""ok... I think I got it""

I already accepted the diagnosis of bipolar... but that borderline thing is so new for me. I never saw ""borderline"" as a diagnosis possibility.
I was so sure about being bipolar, that when she told me, I was not surprised. I suspected about ADHD, but I never expected being borderline.

My triggers are so sensitive and I don’t know why. 

Im so emotional. I wanna die from experiencing all this. I feel useless. I have so many life plans and goals and dreams and i can’t even drive a fucking car without loosing my shit and having to pull over and cry on the side of the road for 30-40 mins. It wrecks my whole day. 

Getting dressed triggers me. 

Why does my whole body itch in like a psychotic hallucinating way? It happens when I’m triggered I start itching really bad my body feels so fucking itchy oh my god and that just sensory over loads the shit out of me and it pisses me off AND THE ANGER so I scream and  hit myself in the face trying to make it stop (of course that doesn’t help) 

I experience the itching and the anger the sensory over load AND don’t get me started on noises oh my god it makes me so angry. 

Then I get overwhelmed with just things that are slightly overwhelming to other people but I loose my shit.  I’m struggling. 

Also I’ve started loosing parts of my memory…. When I get overwhelmed or angry I don’t remember parts of things or things I said while feeling like that. It’s almost like blacking out for a few seconds. 

It also takes my brain a few seconds to understand things and I get confused really easily. It makes me feel dumb 

I just listened to my mom tell me for 20 minutes that I’m not ready to do anything because I can’t do the most basic things (like drive) without getting overwhelmed…. Once I get overwhelmed I then get angry.

What this means: All posts and comments go through our mod queue. We approve them as appropriate at a human rate.

Please do not message us from new accounts asking to approve your posts. We are doing that as fast as we can.

If you want to become an approved user prior to 30 days, we need you to message us from the account you would like to use and then your alt account which we will review.

884,qdb3yv,We have a debilitating disease but it is not an excuse.,"I struggled with this concept early in my diagnosis, and I’m sure many of you have as well. It’s easy to hear that there is something mentally wrong with you, and to run with that card and play it to your advantage. 

Yes. We have a mental illness that can be debilitating and destructive. It can be unpredictable, and with that comes with what seems like a never ending rollercoaster of ups and downs. The outbreaks, the anger, the irritability, the irrationality, the depression, the mania — it’s A LOT, but it gets thrown at the people around us. We may not mean it, we may feel out of control of our bodies, however, you are 100% in charge of your health. 

**NONE of this is an excuse for when you take your emotions out on another person.** 

It is not your partners fault when you are out of control. It is not your mothers fault when you cannot contain your rage. You are not a helpless victim who has any sort of free pass, right, or privilege, to treat someone like shit when you are having an episode. You are at fault if you do not accept responsibility for your action(s) or words after a breakout. If you disrespect or hurt someone, you must take ownership of that, apologize…every single time. You will not learn how to manage your disease and live a healthy life if you expect that people are going to put up with the bullshit that sometimes comes out, with us, because *you have bipolar disorder.* It’s not a pity party, it’s not an excuse. It’s a disease that needs **managed** 

Importantly, it is your responsibility to educate your loved ones on *your mental illness.* It is absolutely vital to inform them of your side effects when down, when up, in the moment (if you are there yet). It’s healthy to communicate the good, the bad, and the ugly. It’s your job to notice when something is wrong. You can’t expect people to just “get it.” 

Bipolar disorder is about honesty and transparency, whether with yourself or another person. Are you medicating properly? Have you noticed your medicine not working the same, and taken initiative to contact your doctor? Are you actively seeking support when you need it? Do you **acknowledge when you need help?** 

Rome wasn’t built in a day, and these things take time, but you and those around you know when you are doing the best that you can. If people in your life refuse to try and understand this disease and hold it against you, that is something *you* need to address, cut them out if necessary, 

Listen to your body and mind. 

Communication diffuses 99% of situation — **speak your truth!** 

Find support when it’s necessary. 

Show up to your appointments. 

Participate in your therapy, actually participate. 

Be teachable and be transparent. 

I promise you, that managing this disease is so much easier when you are doing all the right things. It’s not going to be right all the time, but that’s okay, because you know how to learn from your experiences and use them for improvement instead of making them an excuse.

I became so intrigued in why these medicines that were supposed to be balancing the chemicals in my brain always made me feel sluggish or gained weight or even lactated. I thought that doesn’t seem balanced to me. After reading paper after paper after paper I found that people who maintain a keto diet who have been diagnosed with bipolar don’t have nearly as severe of mood swings as they did while on a traditional diet. It has something to do with the body’s inability or super efficiency to use glucose (usually carbohydrates or sugar) as energy.

893,12jw4lt,My New Neighbors Smoke Weed A Lot & I Think It's Triggering My Psychosis,"I've lived in my apartment for almost 4 years and over the winter, new neighbors moved in above me. 

I started to notice that smoke/odors (nicotine & weed) were coming through the ventilation system into my bathroom shortly after they moved in, and I eventually had to report them to the manager. I don't know what personal consequences they faced but a complex wide email went out reminding residents that there was no smoking of any kind in buildings or within 200 feet of residences which means smoking is also not allowed on balconies.

Everybody smokes on their balconies, and management really never followed through. Now that is nice out, the neighbor above me is on the balcony smoking weed 5+ times a day, nearly every day. It's coming in through my window, which is open because I want to enjoy the gorgeous spring weaths like a normal person. 

The major issue is this - my auditory hallucinations are WAY worse now that they smoke on their balcony, and I don't know if it's stress or from the second hand smoke. I'm also ill every morning from spending so many hours straight in my stinky room. I have an air filter, and I am not putting my AC on in April because of people breaking law. 

Has anybody else dealt with secondhand smoke from weed & their bipolar?

UPDATE: I have shut my window and discovered the problem is still with my bathroom ventilation. I don't think I can explain how much this guy smokes and how much my room reeks. I thought it might be a window thing because spring just hit MA, and I've had my window open for 4 days. But the smoke is *definitely* still coming in through my master bath as it was in the colder months. I contacted the building manager because they need to fix the ventilation and address that we live in a marijuana-free apartment. He is smoking regular cigarettes on the balcony which is why I thought he was smoking other stuff out there, too.",2,0
894,uvczh4,this sub is very one-track-minded on medication and it kinda annoys me,"I'm honestly a bit annoyed how one track minded this sub is about medication being right for everyone with bipolar. Bipolar disorder differs so much in pattern, frequency of episodes and severity. And medication and what side effetcs they cause differs just as much! I am neither anti-medication nor anti-psychiatry. I realize both that medication is life-saving for a lot of of people and that its a privilege to not be dependent on it. I know a lot of bipolar people wanna quit becauce they think they are cured due to no symptoms showing at the moment. However- that doesnt mean its right for everyone with bipolar, at every moment of their life! All medications I have tried (except serroquel for sleep) have fucked me over, a lot more than raw dogging life. I always end up dissociating, like a zombie, and it genuenly feels a lot worse than when i dissociate while depressed. I do feel this might change in the future, where medication might be more right for me. I still have depressions that makes me dysfunctional and suicidal, highs that shake up my life and unstability- but it still is a life I enjoy more than when I'm medicated. Same with quitting alcohol, marijuana, never doing other drugs- everyone is different and complete stability is not worth it at every cost- for every one (even though its most bipolar peoples goals). I realize medication is life-saving and life-changing for most people with bipolar, I just wish there was more room for nuances on this sub.

I’m sorry but I am fucking sick of people coming on here and posting their dumb stories that aren’t even closely related to bipolar then they ask if they are. When I was diagnosed I didn’t even know what the fuck bipolar was and my doctor had to explain it to me. I also didn’t fully understand it for months because I was diagnosed while full blown manic and could not focus or retain any information or even understand the depth of the illness.

I feel like I suffered extreme depression and severe mania to be given this diagnosis. I have invisible battle wounds and have fought many battles in my life where I didn’t even think I’d survive. It was soooo hard to function in either extreme mood. I was on disability bc I couldn’t go into work manic.

It really bothers me when people come on here and are like “I get mad then I get really happy SO I must be bipolar” it’s like no bitch... get off Reddit, go to a fucking doctor, and sit on the couch like the rest of us. 

Holla to all my bipolar peeps. Shits rough but we got this.

904,10mzvhz,LIVID AF,"Update: these were not adults. All parents have to sell tickets from both teams on a rotation. It was NOT a scene, it was in the ticket tower (like a shed) that has windows and doors which were CLOSED as soon as I got inside the tower. I didn’t “take over” i was asked to help because I worked the game Tuesday and everything went just fine because I did what I was told and what they showed us at training. Instead the 4 parents in the ticket booth (that dodge ticket duty every other game) didn’t give it time to set up, the game was already underway and 40+ people were waiting in line behind the rails until the ticket system was up and ready (which I had to set up). These same parents don’t pick up their kids from events and we always take the stragglers home. There is a history of laziness and entitlement on their end and it affected all spectators because they had to stand behind the fence until the ticket booth was open. 

As I’m explaining what to do, I was agitated. I wasn’t yelling, or slamming things, and as much as I wanted to cuss, I held it and said “freaking” instead. That’s when my husband said “stop it”. Again, I wasn’t livid or out of control! This further exacerbated the situation because I know how I can get once I’m past the point of agitation but this wasn’t one of those times. The restraint I showed, shows me that I’ve grown but the “stop it” put me right back in the RED!

Once it was up and running, I apologized for sounding condescending because I was. They apologized for day drinking too long and not getting it set up in time and they thanked me for the help and we parted ways cordially and went and cheered on the team. 

I’m NOT perfect. BP is new to me! I was mad when I wrote the original post and should’ve explained it better. I am on meds, in therapy, and do the best I absolutely can do every fucking day, forgive me if I fall short, not perfect and never claimed to be. 

Thanks to all of you who gave me constructive comments, supportive comments, and encouragement… I truly appreciate it! Also, my husband apologized when we got home. He said that he should’ve redirected me differently, but he also said that I get a specific tone when I’m amping up for a meltdown and when he heard that tone, he panicked thinking I was about to go OFF, and all he could get out was “Stop it”! (That’s fair) His goal was to distract me long enough to figure out that I was getting sarcastic OR worse case, get mad at him and not them and take one for the team. (So to speak). It backfired somewhat but after talking through it, we came up with a way to diffuse the situation if it comes up again (it will anytime these 4 parents work the gate)! 

My original post was looking for ways to get through a rapid cycle and still function. Everyone is NOT going to cater to my mood and they shouldn’t! I have to learn how to function even in bad moments. As well as my husband’s “stop it” comment, but I think I explained that a little bit better too. I’m currently not mad at 7 in the morning lol.  Easier to explain with a cool head and probably gives a clearer picture of what was going on at the time. (I hope 🤞)

Y’all also taught me that no matter what, own your shit and do better, so thank you! Might I also suggest that all though I’m new to this board, we may want to show a little Grace when our fellow BP sufferers reach out, tough love and facts are needed but dang, the name calling and prejudgement that I’m some unhinged bitch couldn’t be further from the truth. I come to Reddit when BP hits me with something new or I’m struggling with something in particular…my therapist is amazing but who better than a community of your peers too?? Just keep that in mind for all of us, please! Thanks again, time to move on and have a productive Saturday!! 

Good day to you all!! ✌️ 

Help me out Reddit Friends! I’m a rapid cycler and having quite the time today! But here’s why I’m about to lose my shit!!

My husband literally told me to “Stop It” like you would a child! I was getting agitated at the ticket gate of our daughters game because the link wasn’t working and the sorry ass Stadium employees were about as incompetent as they come! So after I go behind the counter and literally show them how to reboot the system etc. I made the comment “y’all really need to have this together before 100 people are trying to get into a stadium, that’s F- ing ridiculous” NOTE: I said f*ing…not the whole word! 

He whips around and goes “STOP IT”! Ummm WTF?! Was I out of line? His response when we got in the stands was “You have GOT to control yourself, I never know when you’re going to “BLOW”….again, WTF?!? 

Am I taking this wrong? Or did he literally chastise me like a child, then give me that subtle “dig”!!!!

905,tbg35i,Decided I don’t have bipolar,"Doc diagnosed me about a year ago, and assigned me all sorts of meds. I’ve had the typical symptoms: depression, slight mania, violent tendencies, psychosis. But i think my diagnosis is wrong

At the time I was going through big life changes, I was gaslit, verbally abused at a toxic work place and fired, my finances were in shambles, and I was isolated by everyone because I was no longer the nice hardworking girl people knew.

It made me think anyone with the same problems as me then would start having these reactions, and there really was nothing wrong with me. In fact the meds from the doc seemed to exacerbate my symptoms at first. But after a year of trying other meds I am still depressed/ hallucinating from time to time.

Im starting to think my friends and family were right and there’s no mental illness, just a really bad place in life/quarter life crisis.  I’m gonna try convince my doc I don’t need meds anymore.

What do you guys think?

Edit: I’m tired of being the “crazy” person. 

If I am myself or be honest with family, friends, or work, even if it’s just a little bit, it freaks them out so bad (I tried). So here I go trying to suppress any “abnormal” behavior, convincing people I’m normal. If I be myself I just offend or scare people with my words or actions 

When I tell doctors nothings wrong, they seem to find something to worry over.

When I feel like I need help, I have to convince family and friends thats something wrong and they don’t believe me. I just can’t win.

I just want to be normal. I feel gaslit by friends saying I’m normal, and doctors saying I’m not. Im sick and tired of this endless cycle of doubting myself and driving myself crazy. 

That’s why I want to do a hard reset. No meds, no docs, for everyone and myself to see who’s right. I feel like I can’t trust anyone or my own judgement until all playing field is levelled",0,0

911,62lj1y,i Refuse to see mania as a mental illness,"After being diagnosed as Bipolar and put in hospital for manic episode, and being forced to take medication(lithium), I still believe that mania is a profound experience that is more related to spirituality and unlocking of the unconscious mind.

There are so many things that I could ACTUALLY do during mania way better than non-mania that its astonishing to me really. This is just from a functioning perspective of the body and the ability of the mind.

I was able to play basketball better than ever, I was able to sing better than ever, I was able to drive better than ever, I was able to talk to people better than ever. And these were not delusions, these were things that I actually did during mania.

Then there is the spiritual/mind aspect of mania, that I went through this phase of destroying the ego. After first couple days of mania, I felt that I was invincible and basically could do pretty much anything, and I would look down on ""mere mortals"" that do not have the ability that I possess, however, I felt that this is merely a gift and not something I worked for. So I gradually shifted my thinking and stopped taking everything for credit. After this, I would be able to see beauty in everyone and everything. It was truly amazing, one simple example is girls I guess. Before, I did not want to associate myself with ugly girls, but after, I was able to see everyone as beautiful individuals.

Everything is perfectly well until the delusions. I must say that looking back at those delusions, one must think those are some crazy/psychotic thoughts. However, I think its just the brain being over creative and trying to use its energy to create and connect scenarios in my life and making these delusional thoughts.

Mania also feels like pure bliss, which is something that I don't think drugs can even replicate, its a fundamental happiness that comes from within, and it permeates throughout the body, it truly feels amazing.

One problem I have with people who have bipolar is that they always overspend, I think that during mania, physical possessions really do not have that much value like how society portrays, so people actually buy what they always wanted to buy, and if he/she has the money to do so, why not? 

Anyway, thats my experience

923,gtsaug,"I really, really hate bipolar drugs.","By definition, they are drugs. They are not medicine, because they castrate you and your mind. If you’re in the “meds are good for me” camp, please ignore this post; I’m posting to talk to other anti-psychiatry people here. I also don’t care if I get downvoted because downvotes are about as real as mental “illness” (google “Thomas Szasz” if you want more on that).

I got in a huge fight with my parents today over bipolar drugs (“meds,” “medication,” etc) and I’m still at a loss. I quit taking Lexapro recently—my “doctor” gave the okay—and there have been a lot of symptoms, more than I remember there being with Lexapro. Mostly brain zaps. But also extreme irritability regarding the drugs they have me on. It’s very strange. I feel like I’ve been encased in stone (read: drug use) and I can feel the stone starting to crack now that I’m not nearly so drugicated (lol).

Don’t get me wrong: I have, without a doubt, white coat syndrome, but only for psychology, psychiatry, etc. I feel like mind-related professions are pseudoscience and are used to enforce social control upon many people with quote unquote mental “illnesses.” But also, white coat syndrome occurs for a reason: doctors *are* fallible, don’t possess perfect knowledge, and so on.

I realize that a lot of this may sound combative or hostile toward you and drug (“med”) use. I just deeply, deeply hate psychotropic drug use, especially the kind of drug that is produced in a lab, by a company, for-profit (in the corporate sense, not the drug dealer sense), to be sold as a band-aid for people’s problems, and to chemically strap people to the beds of their minds. Because that’s what it is: chemical constraints, restraints. I feel like I’m strapped to a metal bed that’s as hollow as I am. It’s hell. I’m numb and empty and on and on. The worst part of bipolar (I refuse to call it a disorder because you cannot classify disorder) is that people force you to take the drugs and, as a result, keep you away from the enjoyable part of bipolar. In the end, and in my experience, all I’m left with is the dregs of it. No joy. Stripped and hosed like an inmate—in my own goddamn mind, no less. 

Again, I’m not here to argue. I am who I am and am not interested in changing my mind about this. I have lived almost half my life on psychotropic drugs and they do jack shit apart from making me miserable and literally keeping me down. And yet I don’t have a choice. I’m not part of the one percent, nor am I Kanye, so I can’t spend my life hemorrhaging money in a hospital because I believe bipolar drugs to be ethically wrong. My psychiatrist once told me no one was making me take the drugs. It was the most obscene thing I’ve ever heard her say. Basically spitting in my eye. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say—or maybe ask—is how many of you think similarly on this? I’ve lurked here for a bit and it’s mostly pro-drugs rhetoric, thoughts, memes, etc. I feel that anyone with bipolar who isn’t angry about it doesn’t fully understand what’s *being done to them*: mental castration.

Lastly, if it isn’t already clear, I’m just venting a little and really do hope that some people feel the same way. I’m sick of people in my life fellating psychiatry. And also, to give more background and my “bipolar street cred,” I’ve been hospitalized 3 times, avoided a 40 day court order, and have blacked out a few times. I’m also a great pianist when manic, from what I’ve heard at least.",2,0

I've been diagnosed BPD I mid 2015. That made a lot of sense since I've been having weird behaviors and at the time I didn't even know or understand mental illnesses since I live in a third world country in Africa in which mental illnesses are the last of concerns.  


I refused to take medication because I was in denial and not convinced over the whole deal. However it got to a point where I couldn't function properly.. skipping school for months just staying in my room blocking the door with a sofa so no one gets in, passing out several times from lack of food, many failed attempted suicide, the list goes on.. Then I finally accepted it and started taking medication regularly. At first, it felt good, it seemed like I'm getting my shit together. That with graduating high school (which is a big deal in my country) it seemed the right path to take.   


I spent years on meds however it came to a point where I didn't feel like myself. I didn't want to be that way, numb and soulless. I wanted to go back to adventuring while manic, seing and believing weird shit that didn't exist. Spending several nights up thinking about how I'm gonna be rich and take control over my country and making it a crypto heaven, what would I do if I was a ninja, and how would I come up with a cure for cancer using programming.   


Here I am right now, 23 years old, no medication, no therapy, I do drugs, drink also smoke. I'm embracing the way I am with it's goods and bads. That's what defines me. I love myself!

929,at429m,Quit taking my meds. Best decision of my life.,"Let me preface by saying, this generally is not a good idea and should probably be done under the care of a doctor. Also, what I'm about to say is an unpopular opinion in the mental health community. 

I've[f24] had mental health struggles since I was about 11. On and off meds, in and out of therapy, hispitalizations, abusive relationships, drug use, you name it. Fast forward to my current bf of two years who is basically a ray of sunshine; positive outlook on life 24/7 and never really gets upset even when I am. 

He is very anti-meds simply because he doesnt understand what it's like to not be able to control those types of thoughts and emotions. I went through a period of, ""wow, what's wrong with me? Why cant I fix myself? Why do I need to rely on meds?""

I had an incident in Oct 2018 and my doc basically drugged me up. Maybe not the best idea but that's what happened. Part of me said, ""ok this is what I need to be normal,"" and the other part said, ""why?"" So I weaned myself off the meds and stopped taking them. (Definitely dont stop cold turkey) 

The first month was hard. I'm NOT a cryer. Cant remember the last time I even shed a tear and during that month I was crying randomly. BUT, I was feeling emotion and that's ok. It's been 3ish months and do I still have outbursts? yes. Is it okay? Yes. Everyone on this earth feels emotion and nobody is perfect. 

I am in no way trying to undermine mental illness or recommend that any of you stop taking your meds. We are all different and that's my point. I'm just sharing my story. It's okay to have emotion. You are okay the way you are. 

Tl;dr stopped taking meds and it was a good choice for me. Realized having my emotions was okay. ",0,0

I am besides myself with grief at the fact my baby boy could possibly go through what I've been through at such a young age. Test results wont be back for weeks and all I keep thinking is that its completely my fault because I have it and I have a history in my family as well. Hes incredibly intelligent and I don't want something like this over his head the rest of his life or holding him back because he has so much potential. We will do therapy for awhile to get an official diagnosis. I just can't believe its a possibility. I mean I knew it was possible that he'd get it but I was diagnosed in my early teens. Its heart wrenching. 

EDIT: I am not looking to put my child on drugs. The doctor is recommending a year of therapy and observation before even thinking about putting him on any meds even if its not bi polar. I do not want to medicate my child if I don't have to. ",0,0

948,ld6w6y,"I (29F) did NOT open up about being bipolar to someone I was dating, and it was the best decision I ever made. Here's why:","So I had recently found myself back in the dating game, OH what a fun place to be 🙄😂.

Those of you who are in your 20s and on the dating apps can probably relate: It’s mostly full of 👻s, dead-ends and rejection if you are ultimately looking for a relationship with substance that will last.

So when I finally hit it off with someone, I got excited. We saw each other for a couple months and I never shared with him that I was bipolar.

I didn’t share because I had never met this guy and I unfortunately, like many others, felt like I had to prove that I was “normal” and not crazy. Which IS crazy, because I live a completely normal life and I’m proud of who I am.

So the longer I waited, the more difficult it became to bring it up. I did some research to see if others in my position were facing a similar dilemma, and they were. Of course they were.

I found that we were all scared.

Scared of being rejected simply because of an outdated stigma that is still sadly very, very present in our society today.

So it inspired me to create a mental health awareness instagram and speak out publicly about my mental health because I want to prove to the WORLD 🌎 that you can be “normal” and have a mental disorder.

Actually, you are probably MORE normal if you have a mental disorder with the fucked up state of our world. (And if so, please seek help- most therapy copays are covered bc of the pandemic)

I respect that we all have vastly different experiences and need to open up on our own time. But if you do have a mental illness, I encourage you to join me in starting the conversation so that we can pave the way for people to own their mental health and not be afraid anymore.💪🏼

And selfishly… You will never have to worry about telling another damn soul about it for the rest of your life. And that might be the most freeing feeling thing in the world ✌🏼🦋☮️😘✨",0,0

954,28dgq1,"Spouse of recently diagnosed bipolar, can't get over seeing it as a weakness (read before you downvote)","I'm having a lot of difficulty being supportive for my wife seeing as how bipolar runs in my family too (medicated and everything) and our side dealt with it naturally, we don't take meds, we go through our ups and downs and ultimately I feel like we're more dynamic people for it. GRANTED, from the looks of things this is like a 0.00001% chance.

**Preface**:
Warning: this is my own personal opinions/viewpoints and I feel it's relevant to how I'm approaching my problem.

The way I see both my bipolar and my family (father and mother's side) member's bipolar diagnoses is that we are very up when we're up and we're very down when we're down but ultimately we accept that life goes on and if you want to end it, no one's stopping you (or shouldn't - not a popular opinion that you own you're right to life).

Our up swings further our success beyond what we normally feel like we could comfortably achieve and when we're down we just HAVE to get out and it motivates us to seek relief from whatever is upsetting us and it forces us to accept it unlike others who may be able to suppress it.

**Problem**:
Enter my wife. [insert everything every husband has said in this subreddit about how loving they are because they're so insecure that they're being properly supportive]. I support the shit out of my wife like it's a professional sport to the point where my side of the family has accused me of being an enabler of her depressive episodes where she doesn't do anything - may be true, I don't know what to do though.

Besides being molested, physically abused, verbally abused, being hypersexual - but always monogamous with us, she continues to suffer from crippling anxiety in social situations and any situation involving any amount of responsibility. She was recently diagnosed bipolar shortly before disconnecting from her verbally and physically abusive family (all the way into her teen years before college where we met).

I'm worried because before we got into therapy she seemed to be approaching her problems like a problem-solver... cause and effect, methodical, etc. She was trying new things and feeling them out. Now that she's been diagnosed bipolar it seems like she's totally inwardly focused about how she's feeling and is constantly anxious about a meltdown (which I saw virtually none of our whole relationship until the diagnosis). I worry because I know her to be the type of person where if someone said to her ""oh my god! did you know you're blue?"" she would believe them.

Now I'm not saying she isn't bipolar. What I am saying is that the way it has been presented to her is as a problem and not a potential trait or something that you manage and try to forget about once you're feeling better. Just last night after a wonderful day (she admitted), she came to bed at 4 AM (I go to bed earlier because of work), woke me up squeezing me so hard and then started sobbing. All I did was tell her it's ok and squeeze her back - supportive husband.

Inside though... I... can't... STAND... this. People do not just break down crying for no reason. I've been taught that it's a biological reaction in your brain and if that's the case it's in response to something, whether it be an imbalance or something else, ultimately it's caused by something and she's already been on medication for an appropriate enough time for it to have an effect. I know deep down that she's just not accepting either her childhood, her lost love ones, etc, GRANTED.... she had it fucking terrible growing up but I didn't marry someone with PTSD and didn't want to be someone who had PTSD and all the bipolar stuff has caused is for her to ""be at peace"" with being miserable.

**Where reddit comes in...**
I can accept that I'm probably an asshole but I hope that reddit can accept that I'm an asshole doing his best since I don't show my wife how affected I am by this because she's ""going through it"". Ultimately, I feel like I need advice on how to do my job and put myself first because I feel like if I let her... she would drag both of us down in terms of time, money, etc. trying to pull herself out of her imagined hole. I want to help her, but according to her and everything I've ever read online, it's something that the other person has to figure out on their own.... but if that's the case, what if they don't figure it out? Is their SO just fucked? /rant",0,0

But we are still mentally ill and being taken advantage of even if we may not perceive it like it at first.

This is the unique thing when you are manic and hypersexual. It is a state of mental illness that wants to fuck, but every person you sleep with is in theory raping you?

Additionally if we are making the moves to getting us laid we might not mean it.

I am not trying to move this into a space where it would not be punished if a manic person commits sexual assault. I am not trying to justify those actions. But I have yet to have this talk with someone who has BPD where we might not consent to our own actions.

Sure you can love the mania and what it does and find the experience to be positive, I am not judging.

This is a topic for people who suffer from mania so it is not a BPD exclusive thing.

978,r48mq6,Hypomania is the Kundalini energy rising,"Hypomania is a fantastic state of being as all of you who've experienced it well know. It makes you energetic, powerful, creative and sexual. This is the exact same symptoms the yogis of India have been talking about and seeking to achieve through yogic practices for hundreds of years. They refer to is as the Kundalini.

The famous Carl Jung wrote a book named ""The psychology of Kundalini yoga in 1932 and attributed manic phases to this energy that lies dormant in most of us at the base of our spine.

""Kundalini yoga presented Jung with a model of something that was almost completely lacking in Western psychology--an account of the development phases of higher consciousness.... Jung's insistence on the psychogenic and symbolic significance of such states is even more timely now than then.""

""In India,” Jung says, “the serpent is at the basis of a whole philosophical system, of Tantrism; it is Kundalini, the Kundalini serpent” (1977: 322). According to Jung, “This is something known only to a few specialists, generally it is not known that we have a serpent in the abdomen” (1977: 322-3).""

It is a true superpower which is very very difficult for a human being to control within themselves without a well versed and wise teacher and community around them to guide the way. 

If we learn to control this energy inside us and lead it with great awareness through our whole spinal column and through our seven main chakras we will be able to live lives of unfattomable extacy and creative power. But if we use this power in sexual promiscuity, for our own selfish needs and desires it will quickly burn through our whole body and mind, resulting in long stagnant periods of inertia or depression. 

When you feel this energy is rising, you sleep less, eat more, create more and are more horny. Instead of following all that flow in an unconcious way, start meditating alot. Be by yourself in nature. Ground yourself by walking barefoot, hug trees, swim in the ocean, eat clean and abstain from sex. Otherwise demons will come for your energy, mislead you, eat you up and leave you like and drenched cloth.

All humans have the possibility to be bipolar. We all have the feminine and masculine energies dancing around inside us, but few have come so far in their spiritual development as to start awakening and raising these energies from the root chakra up to our higher chakras. 

Everyone in this sub: you should be proud of yourselves! You are spiritual warriors with great hearts that have come so far in your journey of life that you are lifetimes ahead of most of your neighbouring brothers and sisters.

988,awcbts,Am I Bipolar?,"My diagnosis story is a bit complicated. I was diagnosed Bipolar 2 almost a year ago last April at age 21.

I have definitely experience serious bouts of depression before but I can’t directly point to a hypomanic episode. I have had periods of time where I spend lots of money, hypersexuality, am agitated and highly irritable, excessive drug/alcohol use, high motivation/goal oriented behavior, positive mood etc. But is this just me trying to feign off or prevent my depression? Was I just in a good place mentally and then got bored and decided to do these things impulsively just to regret it later?  Are these perhaps just coping mechanisms and not necessarily hypomania? I can’t say if I’ve necessarily slept less during those periods, I don’t remember. I can recall periods of time where I slept 5-6 hours a night in contrast to my usual 10? But hardly ever any less than that. 

I had been on Abilify and Wellbutrin XL since that last depressive episode, and I haven’t had any mood episodes hypomanic or depressive, since. Even now, and I’ve been off of my meds for almost 2 months

. My therapist said that often times medication can be very diagnostic and my positive response to meds most likely signals a chemical imbalance, ie bipolar disorder.

I have also heard however that especially in the United States, bipolar disorder is very over-diagnosed.

So basically am I just thinking about it all too much and I’m probably bipolar? Does it seem like it could be something else? Maybe only time will tell now that I’m off meds?

989,9h8jjr,I don't believe I've been adequately informed about the risks of kidney damage through lithium.,"My doctor is very conservative, having started me on 300 mg of lithium and inched it to 450 where I am minimally functional.

She already wants a kidney function test and lithium serum test even tho she admits it's a very small dose.  From my research into what I have (likely related to GSK3) 900 mg is a standard dosage, even tho some people are on as much as 1800mg.  

I've heard that the therapeutic dose of lithium is close to the toxic dose but I don't understand how that could be possible with what I am experiencing.

992,7syu3k,Bipolar is NOT a genetic brain disease. Here’s why.,"I’m sure everyone knows what bipolar is so I won’t bother explaining it. There has been research suggesting that bipolar as an overall illness causes brain damage. This isn’t the case and here’s why. 
1. The studies aren’t nearly big enough to be conclusive. Most of the studies I looked at had very few people in them. The largest study I saw that observed the brain of bipolar patients was 99 people. Compare this to the 6 million people that have bipolar disorder, and you’ll see how ridiculous it is. 
2. Relating back to the previous point, every single study used a particular type of bipolar. That being Bipolar 1. The most severe, damaging, and destructive kind of bipolar. The reason why this is important is that you have to remember what people with bipolar 1 actually do. They’re 6 main things that destroy and damage the brain. 
A. Obesity 
B. Cigarettes (or any and all drugs for that matter)
C. High blood pressure. 
D. Head trauma (car crashes, blows to the head, stroke etc) 
E. Diabetes. 
F. Neurological disorders (ALS, cerebral Palsy etc) 
And guess what? People with bipolar disorder (especially BP1) have a tendency for 3 of these. Those being b, e, , and c. All of which cause severe brain damage. 
Now listen, I’m not saying bipolar is necessarily good for you. It can certainly damage yourself and others. But it’s probably not going to cause Brain damage. Especially if you have any other kind of BP except BP1. All brain damage is more of a consequence of the actions a person takes while manic/depressive than it is of the mania and depression itself.

1002,27l1rq,"I'm about to get involved with a married woman. I know the consequences, I just don't care.","**THE STORY**


I’ll get right down to it.  Here’s the story:  A few months ago, a woman sent me a friend request on facebook.  I noticed that she was from my local gym, so I naturally accepted.  She started liking my posts and commenting on them.  I did the same.  I saw sadness in her soul.  Right away I knew she was the kind of person I could easily identify with.  One day she told me that my comments were the highlight of her day.  After that, I invited her to text me whenever she wanted and we became friends.  I wondered if maybe this could be a potential girlfriend, but those thoughts were dismissed the minute I saw her profile pics with her 2 children and husband.
Soon after we started texting each other she started dropping me hints.  She started talking about how she’s on her 2nd marriage and how she felt she still hadn’t picked the right person.  Later, she reviled that their relationship has never been the same since he cheated on her.  It felt good that there was someone out there who trusted me enough to be open about such a thing.  The more we talked, the stronger the hints became.  One day she told me she wanted to cuddle with me.  I replied, “You’re married.  You have 2 kids.  We are nothing more than friends. But this was a long time ago, and things since then have changed.


She said she understood and for a very long time we remained friends.  I knew that she still liked me.  I just wasn’t attracted to her.  The more we talked, the closer we became.  I offered her emotional support, while she did the same for me.  It wasn’t until I opened up about my depression that I became emotionally connected to her, and it wasn’t until I had a dream that I physically wanted her.
When I told her about my depression, she was ok with it.  She even admitted that during her divorce with her first husband, she was on antidepressants as well.  It turned out we both has a similar past; mothers who yell and fathers who drink.  She knew I was unemployed, she knew I was broken beyond repair, yet she still made me feel like the most amazing person in the world.  She thought I was brilliant, creative and funny.  She laughed at all my ridiculous jokes and was amazed by my story ideas.  She did not care about my depression, she loved what was best about me, what I thought was best about me.  I didn’t have to try to be someone else, I could talk about mathematics and although she couldn’t wrap her head around it, she listened anyways.  An emotional connection had been forged, a feeling of intimacy was born that I hadn’t felt in over 16 years.
I started becoming attracted physically to her after she told me that she’d had 3 sex dreams about me.  At first I did not know how to react to it.  She was married.  I couldn’t get involved with a married woman, so I told her and dismissed it once again.  That very same night, something weird happen.  I had a sex dream about her.  It was absolutely amazing.  I woke up with morning wood that cut straight through my undies, pj’s and comforter.  It was the kind of wood that lasted so long you’d wonder if you should contact a doctor.  That’s how “wow” that sex dream was.  After I shared my feelings with her, she was ecstatic.  “Nothing but smiles”, she would say.   We decided to start planning a way we could be with each other.
So here we are.  Waiting for the perfect time to meet.  I guess I told you this story because I wanted to give you a viewpoint from my perspective.  I wanted to show you how I felt.  Do you understand why I am doing this?  I’m lonely.  I’m depressed.  I haven’t been with a woman physically in over 5 years.  I haven’t kissed a girl in over a year.  I’m unemployed.  I have no confidence.  I have no life.  Here comes a woman that doesn’t care about any of that.  Am I just supposed to push her away?  Am I to destined to be sitting at home watching Netflix and masturbating for the next 5 years?  If that’s the way things are going to be, I’d rather kill myself.  It’s funny that I should bring that up, because when I told her that, she told me that she would miss me.  Yes she’s desperate and lonely and hopelessly broken just like me.  This of course is why we connect so strongly.

**SKIP THE STORY**


And now for the feelings and questions I’ve been desperately trying to avoid.  I would say at this point I’ve developed an unhealthy, irrational obsession.  We were supposed to get together yesterday when something overdramatic happened where plans had fallen through.  Her water pipe broke, then she got evicted from her house.  She was dealing with the drama of it all and felt this just wasn’t the right time to connect.  Now you might be saying to yourself, no big deal, we’ll just go out next week right?  Well, not in my mind because this always happens to me.  Maybe you misunderstood me.  It doesn’t happen to me sometimes, it happens to me ALL THE TIME.  Every time I make plans with a girl, something dramatic always happens where I don’t get to go out.  Here’s a list of some of the things that have happened:  Her father suddenly got ill and is now in the hospital, her mother had an emotional breakdown and forbade her to go, she got arrested and is now in jail…the list goes on.  Maybe some of those were lies, maybe they weren't.


So what happens to me when a girl cancels on me like this?  It triggers a severe irrational fear of abandonment.  I become obsessed about it and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.  It will burn me and run me to the ground.  But hey, maybe in this case its good right?  I mean it could be such a huge turn off that she’d cut our relationship completely.  Then I won’t have to deal with questions like, “After we get together then what?  Are we just going to keep seeing each other once every month?  Am I going to tear her family apart?  What if her husband finds out?  Am I gonna get my ass kicked?  Would she even leave her husband for me?  Would she even want to?  Would I want her to? But then what?  If she does, she has 2 daughters.  I don’t want kids.  She also has 12 dogs!  I can’t take care of a woman with 2 kids and 12 dogs.  I’m so fucked up, I can’t even take care of myself!  These aren’t even questions anymore!  They’re just the mad ramblings of an insecure lunatic!


As you can see, my mind is spinning wildly over this whole situation.  I feel like I can’t stop now because I’ve already promised her something.  I don’t know, she hasn’t texted me in several hours which means she’s probably mad at me or has already found my obsession a huge turn off.  The longer I wait the more obsessive I get.  If you are reading this I applaud you for getting this far.  You have just experienced someone’s mood go to mild to manic as I sit here and write this.
So what am I hoping to get out of this?  Why am I sharing these details with you?  I don’t know. One of two things I guess.  To get some sympathy related to how I’m feeling.  Maybe you’ve been there before.  Or, to confirm that my thinking is irrational and I should get rid of this woman immediately.  I’m not blind.  I can see all of it.  I can see how this can end in a complete disaster.  I can see my feelings getting crushed.  I can picture myself with my head smashed against the cracked sidewalk, or blown to bits with my father’s shotgun.  I can step outside my body and see myself with dead eyes laying  in a pool of red. None of it is enough to stop me from doing what I am about to do.  Because in this moment in my life, this insignificant part of history on this tiny planet in the vast reaches of space, on this useless rock that has no meaning when you consider time as a whole, that purpose is nothing but an imagined role we give to ourselves, when you see this spec of dust through a tiny microscope and you say to yourself, for once in your miserable existence, “I FEEL.”  I feel something other than just pain.   If you can see that, then you can understand why I’m about to do, what it is that I’m going to do.  There is something more to life.   I suppose you can call it hope, if only it lasts for one second.

1014,4o8wod,I may be bipolar and want medicate with mushrooms,"Hello Reddit! It's been a while since i've made a post, it is good to be back...soooo, here it comes: 

I have been having a very roller-coaster-ish life so far (im 25), and i am thinking that I suffer from bipolar disorder 2. I have been depressed earlier due to combination of marijuana abuse where I would smoke daily even though I rarely enjoyed the herb. I smokes for the habit. I do not believe the herb itself triggered the illness but was more of a facilitator and my mood and life in general were the reel root of ""poison"". I quitted smoking weed and hit rock bottom. Before I tended to explain my bad mood was caused by smoking but then I quit and realized that I did not get better. In fact i got worse. Now i was not ""numbed"" by the herb, every evening and felt bad 24/7. 

I took a pause from school, had a wonderful year and accomplished amazing things I never thought i could do, socialized, got popular and respected, got a girlfriend and so on. Things were rolling my way. Almost. In the period i felt relapses. I slowly got better and better, but now 2 years after, i feel that the progress has stopped. I have 3-4 weeks of joy, belief in myself - times where I just enjoy my stay here on earth. Then this period is followed by 3-4 weeks of mental pain, emptiness, low or none self esteem. Sounds like bipolar, right? I have not been diagnosed but i can really relate to the symptoms. I dont become manic as in I do crazy weird stuff, i am just happy and very positive which is related to Bipolar disorder 2. Anyway, i have done some googleling about bipolar and shrooms, and peoples opinions are quite mixed - some say that they can turn their bad (""badpolar"" ;-)) periods to got with mushrooms.

I have done LSD once which i found absolutely amazing and shrooms 3-4 times. First time was fantastic and the 2-3 last were mixed (they were low dozed i think) with no extreme fear but not sheer joy. Ive done MDMA once, also amazing but with a light downer the day after. 

I know the brain is complicated and mental troubles comes in great variety and is highly individual, but redditors do you have any advices for me? Any experience with this? 

I would really appreciate any takes on this.

I have incredible mood swings. One day I envision my future and all the things I'm going to do and the other I stare blankly into the ceiling punching myself in the thighs and thinking about hanging myself. I attempted suicide twice but always cried before I were about to do it and stepped back. I left school because I wasn't able to literally function there. I had such massive depressions that I was always trapped in my mind. I had episodes (usually like a week or two) when I locked myself in the room and wouldn't contact anyone and people were worried about me.

Then there are days I barely leave bed (I work from home) and easy work I would do in a matter of hours I do untill midnight and more. Trying to distract myself by music/movies/games to forget how miserable I feel. I have social problems too. There are days I get super excited to spent time with someone but when it actually comes to that I get very anxious and usually cancel my arrangments. The funny thing is I 100% realize when I have a depressive episode.

1026,b26t77,"""I HAVE Bipolar Disorder"" vs ""I'm Bipolar""","From what I've observed most people with bipolar will say ""I'm bipolar"" when referring to it and ever since I returned to baseline it's irked me for a number of reasons.

I feel like its like saying ""I'm cancer"", or ""I'm AIDS"", or ""I'm schizophrenia"", or ""I'm bulimia"". Now, it's tricky because the word ""bipolar"" has a meaning outside of the medical world.

You can certainly have a bipolar personality (for example, laughing one minute and screaming the next because something pissed you off) but that is VERY different from mania and depression. I actually like the term manic-depressive because it provides an explination.

A big reason this I think this is a big deal is because saying ""I'm bipolar"" implies that you're sick all the time, when in reality, most of us are actually perfectly fine most of the time given proper treatment.

Also, especially in the early stages of recovery I've seen and heard of many that become consumed by their diagnosis and define themselves by it, which can really slow things down. Saying ""I'm bipolar"" is like having a tattoo covering your entire body, wheras saying ""I have bipolar disorder"" is like wearing a weighted vest that you understand will come off eventually - and may return, but will come off again.

Lastly, I feel saying ""I have bipolar disorder"" as opposed to ""I'm bipolar"" when disclosing your condition to people that are unaware or uneducated on mental illness or bipolar specifically is less fear-inducing and more question-provoking.

1032,58sagw,I think i could be bipolar...,"Possibly type 2? I know you guys can't make any diagnosis for me, but I have a few questions. 

First of all, does anybody know of a good online test that I would easily be able to print the results of and show my doctor? Most of the ones I have seen are really brief and don't go into much detail - it'd be good if I could just sit down and answer a whole heap of questions so I don't feel any pressure and forget things when I talk to a doctor.

Second of all, what do treatment options look like? I know it will vary a lot depending on the circumstances but I'm just wanting to know the rough picture... how much medication could I be taking, how often, how long etc. etc. Basically, how much of a chunk of my life both daily and long-term can I expect treatment to take away?

1043,59mp0y,"Stand for yourself, people. Remember that having a good doctor is everything, and having a bad one can get you killed. Know rational bipolar treatment principles. Know alternative (endocrine, immune, and so on) approaches to bipolar treatment","I see that there is a lot of doctor worship here, along with people on cocktails of many meds which frankly seem pretty insane. So I felt compelled to write this to remind you about importance of having a good doctor and proper treatment. That's literally difference between being disabled and high functioning for you guys, I'm looking at those who are given advise to change doctors immediately in comments. Don't wait for you having to get that advice.

There are lots of good doctors of course. But there are lots of bad doctors too. And some very, very bad doctors. To properly manage bipolar, to be able to have good quality of life, you need to learn how to distinguish between good and bad ones, and NOT listen to bad ones, they make things worse. 

**Having a good doctor is everything.** Please don't ever forget this mantra. 

Now let me write about some rational principles for bipolar treatment.

**1. Antidepressant usage for bipolar should be avoided if at all possible, they make illness worse, say psychiatrists specializing in bipolar disorder**

Check [here](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/#principle-c-beware-of-antidepressants) or [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mood-swings/201304/hating-bipolar-meds-the-illness-persists), both are articles by decent psychiatrists. First link is from a psychiatrist with 2 decades of experience who specializes in bipolar almost exclusively. Below are select quotes from those articles. 

1.

>**Unfortunately, most patients in the US and across the world receive the wrong medications: they get antidepressants, which are ineffective at best, and harmful at worst (causing more and more mood episodes over time)**. I've published and done research on this topic for two decades <...>. (I know many bipolar experts disagree with me on this issue, but I don't think the science supports their wishes to make antidepressants seem more effective than they are).  With these wrong medications, patients do worse. No wonder they hate medications; it is fully understandable.

2.

>**Antidepressants can cause “rapid cycling”.** Technically this means more than 4 mood episodes per year, of any type (depressed or manic or mixed), but cycles can be as often as every day or few days and a few people can go even faster, so-called “ultradian (more than one per day) cycling”. Rapid cycling is often harder to treat.

3.

>**Antidepressants can cause hypomanic or manic symptoms** (sometimes called switching”, meaning from depressed to manic). Overall, this is thought to occur between 20 and 40% of the time when a depressed patient with bipolar disorder is given an antidepressant. Though one review found much smaller percentages, the first study dedicated to looking for this rate came out with a switch rate of 20-30% in the first 10 weeks.

4.

>**Antidepressants can cause “mixed states“.** Remember, bipolar disorder is not like the north and south pole; hypo/manic symptoms can occur while depressed symptoms are also present. In a way, this is the same problem as #2 above, except that instead of switching from one state to another, you have both at the same time. Usually this looks like agitation or anxiety, or irritability; and difficulty sleeping; and depression, all at the same time.

**2. Antipsychotics (neuroleptics) should be used very sparingly if at all. If used, than only use neuroleptics for help with acute symptoms, and not for maintenance**

1.

Antipsychotics (neuroleptics) can cause [reduction in brain volume] (http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/07/03/antipsychotics-and-brain-damage-shrinkage-volume-loss/), it was confirmed on [primates](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v30/n9/full/1300710a.html) and [schizophrenics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3476840/) and should be common knowledge by now. 

2.

""Second generation"" antipsychotics (neuroleptics) do not merit this distinction [according to some experts](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(08\)61765-1/abstract). So although atypical antipsychotics (neuroleptics) are thought to be safer than typical, they still have severe side effects, including tardive dyskinesia (a serious movement disorder), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and increased risk of stroke, sudden cardiac death, blood clots, and diabetes. Significant weight gain may also occur. 

3.

Antipsychotics (neuroleptics) can cause [wreckage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21295450) to your [endocrine system](http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/703934) with often unknown consequences. Considering that there is a probable link between endocrine system (more on that later) and bipolar, this point is of utmost importance.

**3. Lithium isn't benign either, try to minimize its dosage to lowest effective (personally, I ditched it altogether, more on that later)**

Lithium can induce the [syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15714160) of irreversible lithium-effectuated neurotoxicity. Lithium can lead to [health problems](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.132.5.529?journalCode=ajp) in children. There even are some [doubts](https://joannamoncrieff.com/2015/07/01/reasons-not-to-believe-in-lithium/) about lithium effectiveness among psychiatrists. Use with care.

**4. Beware of oppositional tolerance, it develops to almost all psychiatric meds and to all psychoactive substances**

Oppositional tolerance means that with time your brain compensates for a psychiatric medication (or any other psychoactive substance). This is because each medication/substance works by disrupting normal processes happening in the brain by altering signal strength via changed neurotransmitter levels. 

When you stop that medication (and sometimes even without stopping) you get opposite effects of what that medication initially provided. Simplified [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/58kex2/why_withdrawal_takes_months_for_some_people_or_on/) on this topic I made regarding weed, but just substitute weed with anything else, explanation will be as valid. 

Some people need much longer (or maybe even never will) to encounter oppositional tolerance. Others are not so lucky, so when medication stops working you are worse off than before you started.

**5. There are other approaches to treating bipolar disorder, completely different, but sometimes very effective**

1.

Modulating endocrine and immune systems seem promising. I'll expand only on endocrine, because that's what I have experience with. We know about links between [hypogonadism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972022) and depression, [hyper/hypothyroidism](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/thyroid-and-bipolar-disorder/) and bipolar, [estrogen](http://www.studd.co.uk/dep_women.php) and depression, and so on. Estrogen link seems especially interesting, turns out estrogen modulates lots of things no only in female, but in males bodies too.

2.

I now do hormonal replacement therapy for bipolar (over than three months now), and stopped all my meds. I know three months doesn't sound like a lot, but this approach lifted my depression without inducing mania, and it has some decent theory supporting it too. It's not perfect, but I know I'll keep trying in this area, and won't go to psychiatrist meds again. Side effects from this approach, compared to side effects from meds, are nonexistent.

To be able to do this I found an experienced endocrinologist, who was willing to try hormonal replacement approach for treating bipolar, despite all my blood tests being in normal range. I repeat, I do NOT have any pathology in endocrine system, and still use this approach. My endocrinologist is crazy in a good way - he is willing to try unorthodox approaches and does best he can to make it safe. God bless him.

Testosterone, estrogen and stress hormones are all somehow implicated, I have to monitor them. I'm replacing testosterone in particular, in addition with some thyroid hormones and even a bit of on-demand cortisol replacement, but my protocol is kinda crazy.   

There is a [paper](http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JBBS20120100005_46044311.pdf) which reviews existing hormonal replacement approaches. Another [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/attention-please/201310/hormone-imbalance-not-bipolar-disorder) on the same matter.

My very own personal opinion is that in majority of bipolar patients (not all but yes, the majority, though YMMV) the disorder root cause is not in the brain, and the poor thing should be left alone. We know about how much some disturbances in endocrine system can affect mood due to our studies on women, schizophrenics, and transsexual people. If I'm correct and this is indeed the case, it will also explain why psychiatrist meds are so ineffective for so many people on this sub. 

3.

I also looked into ketogenic diet, and on paper it's really, really promising. Extremely effective anticonvulsant, with all bipolar meds being that (including lithium, has anticonvulsant properties too). It's ""natural"" in a good way, meaning that we get major changes on cellular level, in mitochondria, etc., and for ""free""- we're invoking existing mechanism in the body, not trying to somehow externally change its state like with psychiatric meds. Our body likes homeostasis, and so invoking existing mechanisms is always better because our body will fight back otherwise. 

4.

And than there are approaches with modulating immune system, but I haven't done much research on this for now. I'll just say I learned that immune system disturbances can give full clinical picture of bipolar disorder. 

**P.S.**

Let me end with this. I was on meds for a long time. As you already know, meds and, maybe more importantly withdrawal, suck. But that's only the part of it. Another part?

Depression, hypomania, suicidality, self-harm, rapid cycling, all of that I experienced due to both meds, and more importantly, withdrawal. How do I know it's meds? Simple, I was never rapid-cycling, extremely suicidal of self-harming before, first year on meds I started self-harming. Why I'm sure it's meds not just my natural course of illness? Because I had problems keeping a job and tried to get help mainly due to this, but I always had those problems, they no worse that year when I met my first psychiatrist.

Now I tell you what: I see lots of doctor worship here. I don't like this. If you can't get a good doctor, you're probably be better off with no doctor at all, because having a bad one WILL harm you. Medication should also be used more sparingly. Being on cocktails of 4-5 powerful psychiatric drugs is not okay for almost anyone.

Why I'm so concerned about this and making this post? I have a personal motivation here people, three persons I know including myself were involuntarily hospitalized due to doing what bad doctors suggested them, so to speak ""listening to your (shitty) doctor"". 

It's your life, keep safe, question authority. No doctor will ever get how you FEEL on what they prescribe you. You gotta stand for yourself. Don't like how you feel? Change meds, change doctors, and remember that meds can cause depression, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and so on in themselves. If you doctors tells you your current meds can't do this, don't believe them, they are misinformed at best, and change them NOW. Remember, your doctor should get your informed consent by telling you everything about meds they are prescribing.

You know, the ones that tell us not to tell a depressed person to snap out of it. That part doesn't annoy me, the responses do. The people who compare mood disorders to diabetes or broken legs. 

I just want to say, fuck off. My bipolar disorder isn't a broken leg. It's my brain. My brain. I can cope with the pain by changing my perception of that pain. I'm annoyed by this idea which disregards this fact. Medication only goes so far, perhaps only far enough to give me that motivation.

Yea, maybe my brain isn't regulating properly but to deny there is anything I can do, and to deny the psychological aspects is brushing away any hope I have on those days where the medication just isn't cutting it.

I'm not going to call in sick to work whenevere I feel like hell and my whole being hurts giving up saying, I have a disease and can't be like other people. Ive done that, it isnt good. It makes things worse. Sure, a mental health day here and there is fine but, make it a mental health day not a lie around feeling sorry for myself kind of day.

I feel like these sorts of posts imply that's what people with mood disorders are entitled to do, act like invalids. No @#% I have bills to pay and you know what else? I've gone out feeling like hell and found myself having an 'okay' day. 

Respond like that to one of these posts and you're told, you don't know depression though, that's you're insensitive to what it's like to be depressed. That depression is entirely hopeless. It isn't something that is even minutely in your control and you have to lie around like a sad invalid until your prozac, lithium, whatever starts working. 

I don't openly discuss my experiences with bipolar or the nasty, severe depressions I've been through with these types of people. I assume they'll think I'm being dramatic and write off what I've learned from it as some sort of ignorance to the disease.

1054,52qtw2,are ''bipolar'' famous people really bipolar,"**How many of the famous bipolar people do you think are actually bipolar?**
&nbsp;

I used to check regualry which people are bipolar since it gave me hope, but it started to feel fishy to me ever since I saw some websites that stated that people like Jim Carrey are bipolar, which is just ridicoulus. Provided that sources on wikipedia should be more creditible ,at least it says *""this is a list of people accompanied by verifiable source associating them with bipolar disorder.."" etc* , on the begining of the page.
&nbsp;

Im not saying all of them arent though. But some people kinda make me doubt if they actually have it
For example:&nbsp;
**Russell Brand**,**Mel Gibson**,**Lou Reed**,**Robin Williams** . Even **Stephen Fry** makes me doubt how he has been managing the most of his life without meds and being succesfull. I have watched his documentary, I am pretty sure he is properly diagnosed ,but still how come he has been able to cope so well,? And that is mostly without meds in his early life up until fairly recently. At least on the outside.
&nbsp;

And then again, there are people in the past supposedly bipolar, but how can we really know? People like **Marilyn Monroe**, **Frank Sinatra** . Even earlier, like **Edgar Allan Poe** and **Vincent van Gogh**. I know that Van Gogh died of suicide and had a pretty painfull experience. I even recall that his suppoused final words were pretty grim,but Poe has not been proved to have commted suicide. And even though he didnt have an easy life, how did he manage to cope without meds until the age of 40?
&nbsp;

I just have this sceptical feeling, and reading about most succesfull people with bipolar dosen't make me feel more comfortable anymore, because, as stupid and egocentric as it sounds, I feel like I have something different than them. Maybe I know too little about their life.  The bottom line is , do you think that many of those famous people with ""bipolar"" might not have bipolar afterall? Not necessarily people I listed above, just people considered bipolar in general.

1056,pgtfwy,Bipolar 1 and completely cured??,"Hey there ladies and gents, just though I’d share with you my experiences when it comes to this crippling mental illness. Very briefly, I had a serious manic episode exactly a year ago, subsequently sectioned and then discharged within 28 days. I’ve always been skeptical of conventional medication, so even when I was in hospital I used to slip the tablets under my tongue and flush them down the toilet. After being discharged I still didn’t take any medication,  I was considered at high risk ( mainly because the doctors though that I was taking medication in hospital and coming of it so quickly after been discharged would pose a high risk of relapse) off course they didn’t know I wasn’t even taking medication whilst in hospital. Against all medical advice I refused to take any Medication, I was being called and visited by the local mental health team almost daily for at least a few weeks after discharge. 

They all where essentially waiting for me to relapse, it’s been a year now and I’m fine, no depressive episode no manic episodes, my mood is very stable, things that would upset/depressive me in the past no longer have the same affect. I am far more confident, gained some healthy weight. In short I’ve never felt better in my life, I feel like the blinkers are really off, I don’t get nervous around people, hardly any anxiety whatsoever. Nothing at all like I felt before my diagnose.I don’t really now what this is down too, but I would like to mention the following.

1. MINDSET- I never believed even when I was in hospital that there was something “wrong” with me that needed fixing, I understand and accepted the diagnose but felt that because it is largely psychological, then my best bet is to deal with in my mind not rely on drugs. I decided this very early on. I told myself I’m bipolar, so what! , if I feel depressed I know that’s just the cortisol if Iam a bit excitable I know that’s just rush of serotonin. This Hormones don’t define me I define them ! I define myself ! I’ve always been someone who’s sure of himself outside of the depressive phases of bipolar so this wasn’t hard for me.
2. HIGH STRENGTH VITAMIN D- I’ve always had low vitamin D levels and read somewhere that vitamin D is more then just a vitamin but acts almost like a hormone. I swear by this, my bones no longer ache when I wake up, no weird clicks when I Bend my knees etc
3. COLD SHOWERS-my skin is no longer dry,high sex drive, Golden complexion, a sense of vitality etc ( look up the the health benefits of cold showers so many to go through)

Today it became apparent to me that this sub is no longer of use to me, and my story and experiences are not of use here 🤍 Despite being diagnosed in 2014 and struggling with meds for a year, I've been med free and relatively symptom free since doing CTB, extensive emotional regulation work and circadian rythm reset. After 7 years without major symptoms I don't feel as though I resonate with those who are actively struggling with symptoms. 

If there is some major advice I can leave y'all:

-get in your bed for 8 hrs even if you're not sleeping
-eating regularly will do wonders for you. Don't discount a meal routine even if your meals vary
-if you haven't tried abstaining from potatoes to see what it does to your blood sugar ... Why not?
-take the time to breathe and see if people around you seem bewildered, concerned, or irritated with your behavior. The desire to not disturb the peace of others is a great guide for not acting cray cray. 
-take your meds but don't be afraid to find a medical support system to help you wean and do CBT if that's what you'd like.

1070,h8af2f,"You want it to stop? Well, you can’t, but you can manage it!","I’ve been experiencing bipolar issues for about two decades now.  It sucks. It sucks really bad.  However, I believe I’ve been able to manage it as successfully as humanly possible and I’d like to share with you how I’ve done it. 


First things first, and I cannot stress this enough: what you put into your body is the single most important way to manage our illness.  Food is our energy source, point blank.  A healthy vegan diet is unquestionably the best way to eat. You can debate it all you want, but if you eat nothing but veggies, fruit, whole grains, etc YOU WILL FEEL BETTER! 


Again, I will repeat: A VEGAN DIET IS ESSENTIAL FOR A HEALTHY MIND AND BODY!  You can argue and debate all you want, however you cannot refute the fact that if you eat a complete nutrition filled vegan diet, you cannot go wrong.  There is literally no downside to it. 


Secondly, abstain from all alcohol.  I’ll admit that I have a glass of wine a night or two a week. And I feel awful the next morning. I no longer drink beer or vodka anymore and I’ve noticed a world of difference.  You choose what you put into your body, if you’re bipolar and you drink moderately to heavily, it’s no longer on your brain chemicals and it’s now on you for the reason why you feel shitty.  So STOP DRINKING ALCOHOL!


Thirdly, get outside and be active somehow.  If you’re not athletic, just go for long walks. Be with your thoughts and accept them.  Use the time to think of different ideas on how you want to spend your life. You may come up with a brilliant idea!


Lastly, in regards to romantic relationships, there are two ways to go about it. If you’re wanting a short term one, just go with it and safely fuck your brains out with whomever you’d like just as long as you make it known that you’re not going to get serious.  If you are looking for a long term relationship, you must tell your partner about your illness, how it affects you, and you must let them know what you need from them when an episode comes up.  Open and honest communication is essential.  If they’re not willing to help you when you’re low, then they’re not a long term fit for you.  In addition to this, you must also return the favor to them if they ever have issues too. So many times I see posts on here about selfish needs and how their partners aren’t helping, but it’s most likely because it’s only a one way street. 


To conclude on how to successfully manage being bipolar:


1 - A healthy vegan diet
2 - No alcohol or hard drugs 
3 - Be active outside
4 - Honest Communication with romantic partners.",0,0

I am now the only parent. 

I had stopped working full-time in 2012 when my oldest daughter was born to be home with her. I needed to go back to work when I became single but found it hard. I have, after several failed attempts, finally returned to working in my actual career field as a teacher this school year full time.

1076,z2vrox,Was all of this legal?,"In June of 2021 I was placed in a psychiatric ward for 11 nights and 12 days. I didn’t feel things were being ran right and I thought rules were being broken by the people running it and I said so to my primary doctor. Then he told me he would pull some strings to get me out and started to act all nervous. It was my first time being placed in a hospital and I really want to know if I’m just traumatized and paranoid or if illegal things were really happening. 

In the ER I had a female security guard. I told her that my worst fear was being placed in a psych ward and she was trying her best to help me out. She took me to the bathroom so I could pee and told me not to say much because people were listening outside the door. She also told me not to eat any of the food they gave me and she threw it away. Can they put anything in your food? 

After I was transferred to the new hospital I was strip searched by a female and I was allowed to keep my underwear on. But when I walked through the main doors of the ward I immediately had a massive panic attack. This was my worst fear. I forgot my name and I lost the ability to speak. Then they started talking to me like I was a baby and they told me to walk into this small room. I did so and there was another door in there. They told me that I needed to go in and that there was someone waiting for me in there. Even in my state I knew I didn’t want to do that and I walked out of the room and down the hall. Things get really fuzzy after that but I never went in that room. I found out there was a shower in that room. I don’t know what they were trying to do. They already searched me. 

Another instance is them telling me that if I didn’t sign the voluntary papers that they would go to court and I would be there for weeks. 

And I had asked them to lock my parents out of my records because my doctor was talking to them instead of me and I was 18 at the time. But they didn’t listen. 

I also suffered for days on a very bad reaction to lithium that made me have horrible tremors, slurred speech, and eventually got me high. They took their time helping me. 

I wasn’t listened to. I was nothing. My treatment wasn’t private like I asked. Like I said, my parents talked to the doctors behind my back. Even once I told the doctors to take them off my release form. My doctors told them anything they wanted to know. Even after I was out of the hospital. 


I honestly don’t even know why I’m still typing about this place. It’s just been a rough day and I can’t stop thinking about all of it. There were a few more things that were just sucky but I don’t think they were illegal. Like liquid leaking out of my wall and having to waive my bill of rights in a nurses face to get him to let me have a private room because I was worried my roommate would hurt me. And there was man that managed to get into my room and leave a note by the end of my bed with his number on it. I just feel sick and I’m really struggling with my PTSD. I just need to not feel crazy about being angry at all of this. People I get no validation from my family that put me in there.",0,0

1083,tm3hy4,Maybe Bipolar?,"Hello folks (non-english speaker here). 37 years

I doubt that I am bipolar, even though I've heard this from a couple of doctors in the past years. First time I got drunk I was 12 and went full blackout, have been abusing alcohol ever since. Lost my parents before I was 20 and started doing tons of cocaine, did a fair amount of ecstasy and LSD to try to get out of cocaine. One one of those times, around 23 years old I had an ""episode"". Drank a semi lethal amount of tequila/vodka/whatever and had LSD. I end up punching a guys for no reason, walked alone in the streets (of brazil, quite dangerous) during the whole night, woke up next morning without shirt, shoes, all hurt. Ok, this was my episode.

I've been doing therapy on and off ever since, I am not 37 years old, great career, two kids, but struggle with alcohol. Haven't used drugs for a while, but the alcohol kicks my butt.

I am being honest saying that I would love to be certain that my diagnostic is correct, I have tried an large combination of medication (Lithium, Topiramate, Abilify, Vraylar, etc). None of them seems to work because my main symptom is the RAGE, ANGER and RESENTMENT. I honestly don't think I have experienced mania, maybe hypomania by reading you guys talking about it. I was depressed, but it's understandable how my life was on that given moment.

All I can say, I haven't been truly happy for YEARS now, I no longer feel joy in singing a song for example, I live in a ""gray"" state. But this anger and rage that comes up is nearly impossible to hold, and sometimes I end up being mean to my kids and wife, and most of the time, it takes less than a second for the guilty to come and then I feel like shit.

Again, I am not trying to deny that I have a disorder, I just think it might not be it. All the recent doctors I went took my initial diagnose and went with it, it's been at least 10 years I've been trying medications with no success.

Am I alone? Does anyone feels like this?

1086,rfk1dj,How can I get my friend to stop saying I'm bipolar?,"I went to a shrink the other day and I thought I was going to address bipolar.  It turns out, I just talked about my worries of what I'm going to do with the rest of my life since I'm retiring early and don't have to go into a workplace anymore.  Obviously when it comes to face-to-face meetings, I can't honestly bring up bipolar as a real concern, because it isn't.  I'm not going to have any more ""episodes"" if that's what they were.

There is one candidate episode that I take seriously, and that is when I went to a foreign country for 6 weeks and racked up a bunch of credit card debt and seemed to be hypersexual (though with 1 chick constantly), had psychomotor agitation, and was furious at the girl often.  I got chased through a mall by somebody who thought I was cheating with his gf, and nearly beaten up, made a big scene in the mall, had to see security.  I was almost held ransom in a drug-infested slum where that girl lived.  It just goes on and on.  I admit the whole trip was ""nuts"" but I don't know about manic.  I mean, I kind of laugh to think, ""Gees, how would that trip have been different if you were manic?"" and the answer is just, I dunno, I would have talked a little faster, I guess, that's about it?

On a throwaway cuz my friend is a fellow redditor. My friend Sam has recently be diagnosed as bipolar, and had two pretty severe episodes that sent him to the hospital twice within a month of each other. After coming home the second time, he has been on his meds and is talking normally (just not in speed demon mode like he is if he is manic). BUUUUUT

He is trying to do a lot of life changes at once, and I am just afraid he is going to spiral again, and I want to help him. He just wants to help people thru their issues, but he ends up taking them on as his own to solve. He recently referred to the several people he is dating and/or helping as ""stray dogs"" and said he is helping them find forever homes. So he knows these people have issues but thinks he can ""fix them"". I think it's going to end in financial ruin and heartache. I would never tell him he can't date someone because I don't like them, but I do want to tell him that he is in massive debt from his last episode, so he needs to quit giving the strays money!!!! He bought some furniture for a someone I don't really care for, and he has been out of a job for the last month. He quit his old job with a new one lined up, but ended up in the hospital so it delayed starting because of training schedules. He didn't even tell the person he wasn't making money at the time of buying! I listened to a lot of his side of the convo's with this person, and he treats her like he is her parent. She is super clingy and needy and a drunk. He told  that she ""doesn't drink that much anymore"", which is a problem. She has a drinking problem - she shouldn't be drinking at all. Also, her daughter and the daughter's friends recognize this girl is bad news, and told me everything they had witnessed. The daughter HATES her. I talked to his (my friend's)  mom and found out he is lying to her and his stepdad (who are just trying to help him too) about things, and his daughter tells me about things that he isn't telling me either. He is in a spending mode right now and is acting like it is no big deal. He keeps laughing off that his credit card is  almost maxed out. He is borrowing money from his family too, and I didn't know. So I am watching him buy things and don't know what to do. He bought a new RV late last year (it is financed) and is now trying to get loans to get a truck to tow it and to get a house. I don't think they will give him these anyway, but I just don't want him to spiral when he gets denied.

He's also joining a band (which this I actually support - he is realistic about this that it is just a fun hobby and I think he is a good singer and that this could be an emotional outlet for him).  

I want to talk to him about my concerns (especially since I offered money to him to pay things off that he racked up on the credit card - but now have second thoughts because I want the money to be spent on him - no one else), but I don't want him to stop telling me things or see me as ""the enemy"". We have been friends for 16+ years. I also don't want to make him think that I am abandoning him or giving up on him in any way.  Please give me some advice on approaching my concerns without offending him or upsetting him to the point where he won't tell me things. I love him, and only want him to live his best life. I think he is just very lonely (we live in separate cities and he can't leave until the kid is done with school), and wants something like I have. I have been in a relationship for almost the same amount of time we have been friends. He has gone thru several long term relationships in that time, and I think he feels like he has to settle for these people because he won't find anything otherwise.",0,0

I’m not sure if this community is just for people who have bipolar disorder or for anyone curious about it. I have a neighbor who I just found out a few months ago is bipolar. She’s very insecure about me talking to her boyfriend when there was no harm done and he and I were friends when they were broken up and I’m married. They got back together and now there’s major tension so I messaged him to make peace with it all and wish them well because we were friends and it sucks that I lost a friend because he got back with her but I get it. Well she found out I messaged him but doesn’t know what I wrote because her bf deleted the messages and I’m not trying to hide it because I didn’t say anything bad. Well she told my husband about the messages and for some reason invented stories that I wanted to take him to the hotel spa and get massages together? And try to meet up while my husband wasn’t around. Those things never freaken happened nor were even talked about!!! He asked me what the massages were like when I went to the spa but I never said “hey let’s go together!” Because 1. I’m married and that would be awkward af and 2. There would be no way of that happening because I have a child who I watch 24/7 because we don’t have anyone here to watch her so it would be physically impossible and my husband even told her that would be impossible because of our daughter. My question is, does that seem like common bipolar behavior? Inventing stories like that? My husband didn’t take what she said seriously because he knows she has a mental disorder but for some reason it bothers the fuck out of me. I want to clear the air with her but my husband keeps saying to let it go so I can’t message her or talk to her at all. Help please and I hope I didn’t offend anyone here.",0,0

1113,doanm1,Mania and Spiritual Awakenings Part II: The Kanye Edition,"This post isn't meant to review the album that he just put out.  He just happens to be a very public example of this particular topic.  The purpose of this is to dive back into the concept of mania creating religious and spiritual awakenings or experiences inside of people with bipolar disorder.

About a year ago I created a post detailing some of my own experiences regarding mania and spirituality wondering if this was a larger theme of mania for others.  There were a lot of great responses that on a limited basis confirmed what I was thinking. The post can be found here for anyone that wants to check it out.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7u65en/mania\_and\_spiritual\_awakenings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7u65en/mania_and_spiritual_awakenings/) 

I want to pre-face this by saying that I've been a Kayne fan for a long time.  I don't always agree with what he says outside of his music, but I digress.  Anyone that's listened to his music for a while would know that to varying degrees all of his albums have carried some sort of religious undertone.

Given Kanye as the example:  

* Has a public breakdown in 2016.  
* Releases Ye, an album that generally details experience with bipolar
* Releases Kids See Ghosts with Cudi, a somewhat psychedellic hip hop album largely talking about mental health
* Releases Jesus is King, a predominately gospel album about, well, Jesus

Just interesting to see, whether you like his music or not.  The question is is he currently riding a manic high and the newfound religious Kayne disappears when the inevitable crash occurs?

Once again, I want to make it very clear I don't wish any harm upon him, I don't want to see him crash and burn, and I honestly just hope he's happy and healthy.  I don't believe there's anything wrong with him loving Jesus and there's plenty of evidence throughout his career that this is actually how he felt the whole time.  The only thing I worry about is him eventually hitting the point of no return in mania that many of us have.

1132,ai6oqy,Bipollar SO-Kids and an episode,"Ok, so my SO whom I'm working on divorcing (for lots of reasons at this point) diagnosed with BP2, and probably a bunch of other things. At this point my perspective is that she shouldn't stay in the house, for the past 6 months or so it's been ""okay"". When she's okay (she's a partially functional adult), sits in a corner and sews and helps here and there with the kids and laundry. When she isn't she takes over the living room and basically lives in there instead of her own area. There's been times where she is confused every week, and I really wonder if she'll ever be able to work/function on her own fully.  

Kelly has not been sleeping right for days ie maybe 1-2 hours if any(which happens alot)? Or eating right, I do know that Friday morning she had said she hadn't slept at all Thursday to Friday (1/18/2019).

I had talked about going to my parents with the kids but as there is an expected very bad snow storm I decided to stay home, safer.  Kelly was going to go to her parents, but because it had gotten dark she was going to go Saturday morning. In any case I put some pizza on for Daughter1 and myself, and started getting food together for the other two. I was sitting on the couch with Daughter1 playing a video game (death squared).

Any case Kelly was sitting on the chair off to the side, and started making comments we guessed about the game but it didn't seem to have any relevance. 

Then she proceeded to keep saying things where she was obviously getting confused.  At one point she said Son1 was in punishment, none of us knew what she was talking about. She said something had happened on the school bus.  There were a dozen other things she said where it was as if conversations/context, we were not involved in.  Both Daughter1 and I were sitting on the couch, for awhile Kelly was silent. 

Kelly then started to talk some more completely unrelated things, completely random it seemed. Everything from thinking I was taking the kids somewhere, thinking we were looking for things. She got up and started to talk to all three kids. And they looked at me, as whatever it was she had said (it may be in the audio recording) made no sense. 

I started the audio recorder on my cell phone as I wasn't sure what was going to be said, or not.

I told Kelly several times that she should go lie down, as she was saying she was tired. She responded that, that was a good idea. Then said she was hungry, I said I would bring something down to her. She didn't go down. She kept saying random things, and then went through several rooms thinking we were looking for things, or had asked or told her stuff. When we hadn't said anything to her. 

I was started to get worried as now she wouldn't listen to me to go lay down, or at least sit on the couch. I asked her to talk to her mom using the house phone, whom I'd called. And told them that Kelly was acting weird and really needed to talk to her. I gave her the phone within a few minutes, they called my cell and said they were on their way over to pick her up. 

I had no control of the situation,  I repeatedly asked her to stay downstairs she'd say okay. Then within the time it took to turn around again and come back up not even getting a step or two.  

She kept trying to interact with the kids, which I'm sure freaked me and them out a bit, I got them to go play on their tablets, Daughter2 was in the Kitchen and Son1 had gone into the play room. Daughter1 had gone upstairs and the pizza was ready, she didn't want to come down till Kelly was getting ready to leave. And I had a short conversation with Daughter1 about the situation letting her know that Mary and Al were coming to get her mom. 

I kept having to keep Kelly from interacting the children and she kept getting up and walking around acting as if we had, started a conversation and were trying to find/get something.

About five minutes before her parents showed up she had gone down to her area, and I was by the stairs. She called for me, and I went down the steps and she said there was a man by the laundry room, and another person or two down there. And they were scaring her, and that I needed to get them out of her room.  I got her to go back up stairs and her parents were at the house within a few minutes. 

&#x200B;

Any case they took her to their place, not the hospital like I recommended. They say that it's because she hasn't slept right etc. doesn't/can't eat right (as she gets sick from a lot of foods randomly). She may have messed up the meds as well.

Any case she'll be showing up here at the house again. I've already talked to her and mentioned a whole bunch of concerns etc.. Her response was that everyone has bad days, things can happen to anyone. And to a large extent minimized all of my concerns and lets just say this isn't the first time this stuff has happened. I even asked her how many times is this acceptable to have happen around the kids? (My answer is 0 times) ",0,0
1133,a6k7kt,Am I bipolar?,"Hello. I would like some help of you guys because right now, after a complete year after a huge psychotic breakdown I had due to taking cortisone I cant tell if im bipolar or not. In this breakdown I didnt feel grandiose at all, but my thoughts raced faster than ever and I was extremely agitated. I started yelling so much that I eventually ended in the psychiatric ward. They diagnosed it as a manic episode. What I think right now, after that is that I feel like im in a constant hypomaniac state for more than a year, is- is that posible?

  
In the past I had always felt a deep disabling depression and hopelessness but now, after rewiring my own thoughts through repetition and convincing myself I have somehow accepted my depression... I have become so numb I dont feel troubled anymore. I must say im still a total outsider and in the past I have attempted suicide three times by drinking bleach, swimming deep in the ocean and by jumping off a fifth floor. I have also experienced violent episodes, but they were fueled by my empty feelings of not taking the reins on my own life. But all these troubling events were five years ago.

  
After all this I have passed through various shrinks and they always insisted that every case is different so they never told me my full diagnosis. They told me I had a mix of depression and social anxiety, so they all prescribed me with a heavy dose of antidepressants. I told my current psychiatrist I thought I was bipolar, he somehow agreed and took my medication off one by one and prescribed me only valproate. 

  
The deal is, right now, I feel good. In the past I have dealt with a lot of anxiety and Ive been so heavily medicated for some years, that I dont remember nothing at all from that time. After all of the struggling and all of the medication, right now I feel calm, and feel somehow positive despite my negative circunstances. If I feel slight stress I have learned how to cope with it, control myself and diminish it. I even dont feel tired at all and I sleep good. Since I was a kid I have always been irritable but not until very recently I have somehow learned to nullify negative thoughts through meditation. I remember I had a lot of anger inside of myself and extremely visceral and disturbing nightmares, but they have totally disappeared.

1140,8sbevi,"[27 M] with my possible BPD girlfriend[25 F] of 1 and a half year is making me feel physically, mentally, and emotionally drained","Hello Everyone,

I am currently heart broken and feel so defeated. This past week was  one huge roller coaster ride. Just witnessing a cycle of anger,  happiness, and depression within a short span is so frightening to me.  This morning, I spent the whole commute to my work with tears flowing  down my eyes just to realize I definitely can not focus on my work  today. So I drove back home sobbing. Here I am, on this Reddit post  seeking for advice and help.

Last night, my girlfriend Katy came over to work out with me at home.  During the workout, I told her that I will be busy in the upcoming  weekends as I will have to go Seattle for work. She tried to chime in  saying ""I will go to Seattle?"" implying that she wants to come to work  with me. I told her that it won't be practical as I will be focusing on  work, plus the company is paying for me. She then repeated saying ""I  will go to Seattle?"" I brushed it off laughing thinking that she is  joking. She then asks me ""Are you leaving me?"" I told her ""no"" and that  ""work is work"".

From there on, she continues working out silently while her face  shows frustration and anger. I tried to ask her what is going on, and  then she just ignores me and continues pumping the dumbbell. Then out of  no where she states ""If I make a lot of money someday, I will leave  you"". I stayed silent which then she replied ""When are you going to give  me my $400 to pay for my bills?""

Now going backward one night prior on a Sunday. We were having fun  playing video games and just laughing/talking about random things. Once  the light turned out and we were laying in bed, she asked me in a  demanding way ""Can you give me your money"". I responded ""I'm not made of  money"". Then she stood up and started dressing and threatened me ""If  you don't give me your money , I am going to leave right now. Also, I  will slash your tire on the way out"". This is the exact moment, when I  was afraid of her. Although she is this tiny girl who does have a sweet  heart for me, hearing that just hurts. Not because I believe her, but  because if I had to stay with her for the rest of my life, I will have  to hear other nonsensical things that will hurt me. It makes me feel so  defeated because there is nothing that I can do to make it better. There  has been many instances where she get frustrated or mad at me for the  strangest reasons. I will try to get some sense in her my explaining  what is going on but she seems to not understand clearly. Eventually she  just says sorry and starts hugging me and giving me kisse. At times,  she also tries to just have sex with me. Just watching her do this makes  me feel sad because I feel hopeless.

Continuing from ""When are you going to give me my $400 to pay for my  bills?"", I responded, okay I will withdraw the money for you on  Wednesday. Then I straight out told her, ""I am tired and unhappy. I did  not want continue with this relationship anymore because I feel so weak  and I am sorry for that. I just can't handle it anymore, but I still  want to be your friend and get you help whether it be going to the  doctors or psychiatrist. ""

Her face just lit up with more anger and shouted more nonsense at me.  I wish I could remember exactly what she stated, but it didn't  contribute to what I wanted. She was just mentioning how she is doing  all the work in the relationship and that I am not trying hard enough. I  know or I just hope she doesn't mean this, but it just hurts me hearing  this from her.

Just so you know, she is my first girlfriend ever and when we were  dating. She knew that she would be my first. She was reluctant to go  into a relationship with me because of this, but I told her that it  seems unfair to label me this way which will ultimately lead to  self-fullfilling prophecy of failure. Well, she used this against me  last night saying that I scammed her. It felt like more needles were  pinching my heart because I did feel that way.

I eventually calm her down by stating that I wanted to help her and  take her to a doctor as a friend. I also said lets take some time and  think about if this relationship can continue, and she screamed ""No, I  don't want it to end"". It just pains me so much that I just reluctantly  said okay, but lets focus on what we need to do first which is to see  the doctors. She agreed to.

She went home late last night at 1:00am. I was able to sleep a bit  until I woke up around 4:30am. I was just lying awake thinking about the  possible future, whether I should continue to be her significant other.  I don't want to sound selfish, but I feel like I do have a choice in my  own happiness. I want to break up with her before even going to the  doctor because I don't want her to believe that I am leaving her because  of a diagnosis.

My mind and heart is just racing constantly at the moment, I am not  sure what I plan on doing is right. I already met most of her family  members and it just feels so bad to betray her this way. Currently I am  still contemplating if I should break up now or just continue to see if  things improve. It just makes it more tough when we have so many events  planned out, such as going to Coachella next year and going to Chicago  for vacation next week.

Katy is also in the period of her time where she has been job hopping  constantly because she is not sure what she wants to do for her career.  She has been unemployed for almost a year now. Prior to that, she  jumped around 3 to 4 different low paying dead end jobs. She has this  conflict where she wants to be rich because her father is wealthy just  to make him proud but she understands that is not the perfect way to  enjoy life. I think we share the same value of trust and honesty, but  seeing her this way just hurts me so much.

Although there is no diagnosis of her yet, I strongly believe she is  bi-polar base off of my speculations. Aside from the mood swings, there  are days where she gets few hours or no sleep at all and she feels  energetic. Then there are days where she sleeps for more than 12 hours  and feels tired. I hope I am not labeling her with bi-polar which will  also ultimately lead to a self-fullfilling prophecy of failure. Dealing  with this issue has brought so much tears to my eyes and makes me feel  so exhausted. I think about what future we can have together and I  simply don't see it anymore. We both imagined what our kids would look  like together, but it is so hard to picture it now if this issue  persists or gets worse. I wish I can do more, I wish I can be stronger.

**tl;dr : Girlfriend of 1 and a half year is putting me in  tears with her mood swings. This past week was the hardest as I am  currently contemplating to whether or not continue with this  relationship but at the same time I am filled with guilt and  hopelessness.**",0,0

1153,4nijtp,I think I'm being followed,"Hi guys. I'm typing this on my phone so sorry for any spelling or format mess ups. To cut to the chase I think something is following me or watching me or something I'm honestly not sure. This is going to be long and I apologize ahead of time for that, but I have no one else to talk to. 

I'm 21 years old and live in the Midwest. The first time something happened to me was in 2005 when I was 9 years old and my family took me to see Amityville Horror at the movie theater. The next morning I woke up and a couple strange symbols were carved into my stomach (no blood) with a nail or tip of a knife. I told my parents and they freaked out and accused me of doing it to try and get attention. The symbols -if I remember right- was like an X - 1 or in that idea. There was for sure an X. 

My mom freaked out so my dad made me tell her I was making it up. I wasn't. 

Ever since then nothing has been right. This thing that has attached to me makes everyone hate me. It tells everyone that nothing I do is right and makes my parents hate me. Sometime I wonder if they're even my real parents or not. I mean I look like them but they don't act like other people's parents. 

From what I've told other family and friends my parents of my experiences growing up, my parents have been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life. I know that in my head but can't accept it in my heart. I would die happily for my parents if it meant they would show me some love. Do anything for them. 

Moving on. When I go into the bathroom at nighttime I always feel like someone is watching me from the corner. Like the upper corner where the wall meets the ceiling. I'm afraid of the dark because I know that there is something bad in it. When I turn my lights off to go to bed I sprint to my bed to let the entity know that I am afraid and to please not attack me. 

I've tried blessing the house with holy water but I still felt it. Now I've moved and while the new house doesn't have nearly the same feel as the other one did, it's slowly creeping back. 

My parents hate and are disgusted by me so I'm staying with relatives. They act like the care about me but I know deep down the only reason they're letting me stay there is because I'm blood to them. 

Sometimes I see things out of the corner of my eye. Shapes and shadows and occasionally the figure of a person. This happens at night and in the day time. 

My mom convinced me to see a psychiatrist a couple years ago and I was diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 because of my mood swings and depression but I only took the medication for a little while because it didn't help me. When I go out I'm the life of the party but when I'm alone I feel like I'm being enveloped by a dark being. 

I have days where I think about killing myself but I have never made a real plan or tried. I cut my wrist up bad a couple months ago because I felt like I was numb and needed to feel something. 

I'm always worried that people don't actually want me at their party or sleepover and I really think that everyone talks about me behind my back but then pretends to my face. 

I was in college but my parents pressured me to drop out and help pay for things at home, but that didn't work out so now I'm no longer in school and staying with different relatives. I find myself getting angry about things that other people don't get angry about. 

Some things I like to do are read and watch movies. Being around people just exasperates me but when I am around them I'm the most charming, personable, generous, and funniest person in the room. 

My current job doesn't offer health insurance so I'm not able to see a psychiatrist unless it was really needed, then I'm sure my relatives would begrudgingly pay for it. But do I need a psychiatrist or a priest? Am I crazy or am I being consorted against?

Either way I need help and I've never seen a community that cares as much, answers as fast or as in detail as Reddit. If you have any questions at all for me I'll answer them. What do you think is going on with me??

I'm going to post this in a couple subreddits because I'm not entirely sure which is the right one. 

Thank you

1155,4if60e,I need your open-minded opinion.,"Hi. Before I go further, here's a disclaimer: I do not mean to denounce your experiences, stand against medication, or imply that my opinions superior. I just want to have an intelligent conversation about bipolar. 

My father was bipolar and abandoned the family years ago.

I've gone through bouts of depression in the past. I'm unable to cope well with loneliness (I.e. Living alone after having a roommate), tense relationships, and changes in schedule.. I'm extremely regimented. I have to exercise everyday or I feel irrationally tense. Whenever I consume sugar or refined grains in excess I feel a bit detached from reality-- like anything terrible or wonderful could happen at anytime. My diet originated as a body image problem, but I eventually realized how incredibly better you feel eating this way. 

My depressed periods are mostly filled with this terror that I'll never be anything or feel anything or care about anyone again.   

But what I've found is that, whenever I have exercise regimentation, strict diet, and an available  support system, I'm almost immune to the emotional highs and lows that have historically been so terrifying. I started researching bipolar last year, when my therapist said that onset could occur at anytime.. And these things confused me...

1) a hormonal imbalance 
Some websites say there is no test to measure hormonal imbalance, while some say it clearly in the definition.

2) differences in the brains of bipolar
Doesn't lack of utility in a particular part of the brain cause changes in the brain? So if one part of a bipolar person's brain is smaller or less active, how can they tell if environmental factors or a different mindset didn't cause this change overtime (instead of a genetic predisposition)? And how are medications an effective way to take advantage of the brain's plasticity? 

3) Why is there so little about diet and exercise on treatment websites? Most people know by now that ""comfort foods"" are desired because they basically make you temporarily high. And lack of activity/being overweight/eating like crap while having a fast metabolism is not going to be cured with psychotherapy. 

I've started reading books about alternative forms of medicine. I know many of you have probably had this natural vs. pharmaceutical debate already, and maybe you know more than I do about the topic, but I've yet to see a conversation about this that didn't end in an agree to disagree... 

I'm wondering if you've tried extremely strict dieting? Daily exercise? Supplements? Did it work?  I'm just trying to understand why drugs and psychotherapy are tried first instead of changing your body's composition. If food is the fuel that runs all of these mental processes... How could it not have an effect?",0,0
1156,4azy58,"Accused by SO of telling stupid lies (Just a long rant, sorry)","Last night we crawled into bed and my girlfriend began crying. I know she's been having a hard time with depression (BP1), so I rolled over, put my arms around her and asked if she wanted to talk. This is nothing unusual, and I can usually get her to chill out until her night meds kick in and she falls asleep.

So...She starts by telling me how much she hates nighttime since our neighbor passed away (he always sat on his porch smoking and kept an eye on everything), and how scared she was because the following day she had no work and no plans, basically stuck alone in her head all day.

Suddenly, she accuses me of lying about cleaning the dust from behind her desk, because she looked behind it and still saw some dust. Mind you, this wasn't something she asked me to do, I just did it because it was dirty and didn't want her to deal with it. I told her yes I cleaned it, perhaps I missed a spot. 

Ten minutes pass...""Did you really clean behind the desk, because it's still really dusty.""

I didn't appreciate the accusations, especially at bedtime. I got up, moved the desk, and cleaned the floor and wall underneath it again. There was a 1sq' area I must have missed the first time.

Now she's pissed at me for getting up to clean. I sat down on the couch for a minute to regain my composure. 

""What are you doing?"" she called from the bedroom.

""Just sitting.""

Well now she's even more pissed, because she thought I answered her in an angry tone. She stated that I lie to her all the time, so why wouldn't I lie about this stupid cleaning job.

Now I'm getting pissed, and I'm dealing with my own BP2 with anger issues. I decide to leave, and she begins yelling at me that of course I'm leaving when she needs me. 

I'm now staying at a hotel, and she keeps texting me apologies telling me she needs me to come home. This isn't the first time something like this has happened (lots of accusations of cheating in the past). 

In a nutshell, I'm done with it. I do my best to be a caring, loving partner. I've dealt with her 2 bouts of psychosis, her sleeping with someone else, and coming home to her misery night after night when I'm struggling to get myself through the work day. 

She owns her house, but I've been the sole means of support the last two years. I don't want to go home, I feel like I'll lose my mind. And frankly, I don't want to be around someone who doesn't trust me. I'm just trying to decide if it's time to call it quits, I know I'm happier alone, but the guilt of leaving when she's in a depression is too much.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm on the brink of despair, that there is nothing worthy of meaning and desire. I rarely see my friends and family members these days. I rarely partake in my hobbies anymore, such as poetry, writing, and reading. All my enthusiasm has withered down the drain; I feel like an invisible ghoul. I have faced so much social rejection from peers and it hurts. I do not want to get out of bed most days. I brain feels as if it is on autopilot most of the time; difficulty thinking, making connections, talking, and reading in general. Depression is physically and mentally paralyzing for me. For the past five days I have felt possibly hypomanic: extreme high sex-drive, insatiable appetite for pornography, wanting to sleep with many people (in my imagination), my skin feels like crawling, agitated, irritable, angry, restless, racing thoughts, creative with writing the other night, happy but not authentically; more to do with higher level of chemicals, negative thoughts as well. I do not feel highly talkative, a big spender, etc. but my creative thoughts may enhance more. My moods are so unpredictable, I'm not sure what to do, I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor soon about blood work; she thinks it may be a thyroid issue, but I think my depression is much more wounded and deeper than a thyroid issue, though I'm not medically certified myself. Today, I feel agitated, angry, irritable, but also slightly content this morning with a high sex-drive, and this shifted to negative emotions in the afternoon.  Any advice and tips? Is this simply just depression and a thyroid issue, perhaps? ",0,0
1167,3dcklt,Is being a little mentally unbalanced funner than just life?,"I was talking to a friend today who is bi polar, and he was laughing his ass off about all little things we would talk about. His laughs seemed genuine and it made me feel sad that I wasn't laughing I don't laugh at things I don't find many things funny. I know that sometimes he doesn't have great days and his thoughts are a little dark, but for the majority of the time he is on top of the world and life seems to be going good for him. 

I wonder since his mind is not balanced perfectly does he enjoy life more, I don't find life very enjoyable for a long time now, I feel like I understand it to well and its to unjust. We all want to live life to the fullest and we all think that we are normal and decent people but as the days go on and all the fucked up stuff that happens around you it sinks you into a hole. Yes, I know change your thoughts change your life, and it does work but when I talk to my friend who is bi polar, ( who does take his medication btw ) It just seems like his life seems to be a little bit less stressful.

All my stress is self induced, but sometimes feeling something is better then feeling nothing, I don't want to ever be sick, but maybe being unbalanced would help balance the craziness in the world, the people, and the life I have made for myself.",0,0
1168,3ahjlu,So I took a bipolar online screening quiz...,"And the results indicate I show signs of having bipolar.

I also took similar quizzes for schizophrenia, anxiety, ADD, and depression, and I came up positive for possibily having them as well.

So either I'm pretty coco for cocoa puffs, the quizzes are too vague, or I'm a loser on a Friday night lol.

Anyway, I did take them with intentions of trying to figure myself and my issues out more. I have been ""diagnosed"" in the past with depression, anxiety, and ADD, and am currently on antidepressants under a psychiatrist's care. 

However, I struggle with racing thoughts. I'm a very high strung, nervous, anxious person, and went on Zoloft last week as it's interfering with my life tremendously. I'm also generally depressed. I started getting curious about bipolar as I noticed when I'm not on meds I will go from feeling low to doing stupid things like charging a $1000 laptop or change jobs on a whim.

My focus and thinking is very fuzzy, and I drift off in thought a lot, and I think that's where the ADD diagnosis came in. I'm convinced I don't have it though and don't take meds for that anymore. 

I question the manic thing, as I don't have mania like all the stories I've read that included bizarre delusions and such. I've never had a psychotic episode or lost touch with reality in that sense. I just feel very restless, like my thoughts won't stop. 

I plan on talking to my doctor but I'm afraid of getting a bipolar label in 5 minutes like I did with my ADD diagnosis. 

A frontal lobotomy would be nice. lol",0,0

If you feel that way, go on living you life and ignore this post please.

However, if you don't believe in ""mental disorders,"" think it is just a form of population control combined with Big Pharma making profit off of us like cattle for the rest of our lives, please open discourse here.

I personally believe I have a psycho-spiritual condition.  I take meds only to exist in society.  (I am from the US btw).

How is it logical to call label someone with a mental ""disorder"" and then proceed to treat them to bring them back to ""normal"".  When ""normal"" is an arbitrary human construct that changes constantly.  It is the label ""disorder"" itself that causes us to be ostracized from society, not the symptoms alone.

1173,1zymts,"I believe my BF is having a manic episode, but he won't admit it. I'm becoming irritated.","Update: We talked. He told me he was coming down from a manic episode at the time. So I wasn't wrong on that. Not that that really matters. Anyway.. I told him I was sorry and I know what I did was wrong. We talked about why I get upset and we both know I need to get help. I won't get into the details of what's wrong with me, because I haven't really sorted it out myself. But I believe it has a lot to do with depression? He said he still wants to spend the rest of his life with me, and we're trying to help each other grow as partners. 


I don't know much about bipolar disorder, but I've been with my bf for 4.5 years. We're in a LDR and am very familiar with his typing and speaking habits. I FEEL like I've noticed different times where he quite possibly may be manic, but he will tell me he can't be because he's on his meds. What can I say to that? He probably knows more than I do.

This morning he texts me paragraphs after another about his family packing up (They're moving soon) and he's saying things in a way that he doesn't usually say thing. Like if he were speaking, it would sound like he's talking a mile a minute and not taking a breath and saying things like ""It's crazy. That is crazy. You're crazy"" And little tiny sentences like that. Normally he's a very introverted and almost apathetic sounding guy unless we are having a great time or talking about something he's passionate about. So this is highly unnormal, especially right off the bat. He then goes to tell me he's been off his meds and needs to get more and goes on about his bloodwork blah blah. And then tells me he's really pumped because he got a new visual novel and how it made him squeal just typing that out.  This is were I get really irritated. I try to be understanding and open, but I become jealous and in a bad mood because it feels like whenever he may be having a manic episode/is overly excited about something, it doesn't involve me. I know that sounds childish, but over the course of 4 and a half years, and going through many times where I don't feel like he cares about me because he doesn't show it very well all the time, it irritates me when he is very obviously excited about a new video game.. or a visual novel.. 

Also failed to mention that I pointed out he might be manic and he says ""I'm not ruling it out. I'm logical. I'm just not blaming it."" It seems very obvious to me. 

Since then he's said he obviously needs to hide his happiness from me unless my name is involved. And he can't imagine living with me, sharing his life with me like I say I want, if this bit of happiness causes this much of a problem. ""Something petty is making you happy? Fuck that."" And now he doesn't want to talk to me today.

1174,1tg4j7,I feel so betrayed. Doctors lied to me.,"So, ever since I can remember I've always wanted to be a police officer. But I found out that I'm probably going to be disqualified as an applicant because of previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder. THIS is why I didn't want to get help. I went through a really tough spot in my life as a teenager and very reluctantly got help. I really wanted to get help. And did. But this was one of my fears. The fear of being fucked over in a job because of a diagnosis. I haven't needed medication for some time, and haven't been to an appointment in the same amount of time. Because I haven't needed it, as soon as my life got better so did I. I'm even highly doubting the doctor's diagnosis. I haven't had a mood swing in an extremely long time. I asked the doctor time and time again ""Is this going to affect my chances of employment anywhere?"" and I was met with the same no each time. The level of betrayment I feel is through the Goddamned roof. I'm nervous, I haven't had a good nights sleep in about 2 weeks. My dream career seems unlikely. I went through 2 years of criminal justice to become an officer, but was met with this unfortunate revelation 2 weeks ago. All I want to do is help people, but can't because I thought I was doing the right thing and getting the help I needed. I suppose not.

I have denied it for some time but lately I have caught myself on the verge of having to do some minor chore and just skip it, because... idk. On the other hand, I know, that whenever I get exited about something, I can go all day doing it. Only the problems is, if I don't finish it by the end of the day, the next day I just might forget about it. For example: a few years back I have gathered my friends and we have build some pull-up bars near our living block. It took us a day. And it was great. But when It comes to actually working out on them I skip a day, then a week then I don't go at all. I get bored. Another example: I have always wanted a model aircraft carrier. I bought one and assembled half of it in a day. But when it came to finishing touches... it just stands on my desk. For a month now. Same goes for work. Wen I get a new project the first week is exiting. By the end of the month, I have no idea what to do and I feel like Facebook is the best way to spend my time.. I know that this might be because I'm lazy, but the spikes of excitement ... Am I bipolar?

The mania, if that's what it was, that preceded this nearly 2-year depression was just....ridiculous. I just went berserk on an online psychology forum. Overshared, flirted like a maniac, used too much profanity. And I smoked too many cigarettes during that time. That was it. That was IT. It was this hateful depression that ruined my life, not the mania. 

13 years ago, I had an episode with more dangerous behavior: promiscuity, drinking too much, driving drunk, spending money on stupid shit, etc. But that was 13 years ago! And, weirdly, there were never ANY consequences: no STDs, pregnancies, traffic tickets, etc, etc. Since then, I've struggled with depression off and on, but I've been functional. If I experienced mania, it just looked like being more social than usual and immersing myself in spirituality. I've had a very even keel life for more than a decade!

What I mean by that is that the connection we have with the elements and all things during a psychosis might be real. After all, what is reality? It is very subjective and reality may not necessarily be what we see in our every day life. 

But unfortunately there is a prize to pay for seeing what is behind the curtain, by penetrating God's realm and see the universe not as we are supposed to see it but as an entity such as god would see it.

But now I'm back to believing bipolar does not exist.[Rant, discussion opener]","Basically I'm sure we've all struggled with the diagnosis of bipolar at some point. And I have gone back and forth on this a million times. So I'm not going to speak in any absolute terms, but here is where I am currently at. My diagnosis was the result of a full blown manic epode. No question about that. I literally believed that I was Jesus for a month and the whole 9 yards. Was completely euphoric 24/7. No longer required sleep, all that stuff. But what happened was I was under an unmanageable amount of stress and in a horrible spot in life. And instead of going depressed, or dying from stress, my brain had to do something. So it flipped some kind of switch where I could no longer process things negatively. Well after a month of shenanigans I wound up in the ER. After throwing around 10 nurses and doctors like the beast throwing wolves around in beauty and the beast,  I was held down and given 2 shots of haldol, which brought me back down to earth. It's been about 3 years since then, and I've had plenty of time to try medications and assess the big picture. Personally I don't think Bipolar exists. And I think the diagnosis itself is in fact a very harmful mindfuck. It seems ridiculous that after one episode you would be burdened with this diagnosis for the rest of your life. Most people don't realize the power our own thoughts can have on ourselves. There used to be in psychology the term ""nervous breakdown"" for these types of meltdowns. I think that needs to be brought back. Over the last 3 years I have come a long way from the life situation I was in. During that time were horrible, horrible depressing lows. I tried a lot of meds to no avail. I often isolated myself to basically solitary confinement. I'm sure a lot of us do. But there I think lies the problem. It's been proven that just 24 hours in solitary confinement can do a lot of damage psychologically to a person. We are meant to be social creatures, pack animals if you will. So moving foreword to the past year, my life has improved so tremendously from where I was when I had my melt down. And the big picture seems so clear to me now. I feel great most of the time, my life is together. I have a wonderful girlfriend, tons of friends, I like my job, I have money, it's awesome. I'm truly happy, no denying that. And I did it all without meds. I absolutely didn't do it alone. God damn I was so suicidal and thank god I reached out to people for help. And slowly and surely I took care of all the problems in my life causing me grief. Another huge factor I believe is spirituality. Which was very fucking hard for me to figure out. But now I finally have a view on that that I feel comfortable with and it has helped me immensely. I truly believe this life is a spiritual deal, though I have no religion or anything, just kind of a mash up of them all. Anyways any feedback would be appreciated. And no I'm not manic, just been thinking about this a lot and getting it all out. Much love, and good luck. ",0,0

I in particular got curious about this thing when I was put on antipsychotic for anger, I just observed that my thoughts got very clear and I became very articulate and verbal.  I also realized that it got very easy for me to focus while studying.  I could just simply sit and study without thinking all the BS that randomly popped up.  

I used to think I had a very minor form of adhd for many years, way too minor to get a diagnosis because of my inability to focus, but I feel it might be this thought disorder. And it is because the antipsychotic subsides it which is why I am able to study better.

1203,3buh00,Understanding Bipolar To Get Help,"Most individuals that suffer from bipolar have one goal. That goal is to live a life that is as normal as can be. To get through today without having any emotional problems, to make it through the big meeting at work without having people wonder what is wrong with you and to simply be able to enjoy your daughter’s graduation are all additional goals that you may have. 

Before you can fully learn to cope with bipolar, you need to fully understand your condition. You need to know what things happen, as best that you can, so that you can then trigger your coping mechanisms to work for you. 

There is no 100 percent sure way of stopping these things from happening to you. But, there are countless things you can learn to do to help you to improve your outlook.  

To get to that point, we will start by giving you all of the information you need about your condition so that you can better understand what is happening to you. If you are a family member who just wants to help someone that has bipolar, then by all means, you too can learn all that you need to in order to deliver the help that you can give to them.

Bipolar is a condition in which there are extremes in moods and life experiences. There is no doubt that bipolar is a health condition that is serious and disabling to those that have it. It is a mental illness and it does require necessary treatment. 

You may have heard bipolar called Manic Depression or that a person suffering from it has a manic depressive condition. But, what scientists have come to learn is that manic style behavior is only one extreme of this condition. The other part of it is that of depression. Both of these conditions are vitally serious to your well being and even to your life span and must be treated.

While doctors do not have a cause for bipolar, they are working on finding one. Along with that, you can be sure that there are many scientists looking for a way to cure the condition. Yet, until that happens, we need to examine what we do know about bipolar and what it does to the person that you are.

For most people bipolar starts when they are just in their teens. Some believe that it is triggered by puberty. Others  
will not develop this condition until they are in their early adult years. Bipolar can last your life time, too. 

For most individuals, bipolar is a condition that doesn’t happen all of the time. You don’t go in and out of moods ore other experiences within seconds and you don’t do this all of the time either. For example, some people will have bouts that last for several weeks. Others will have them for a few months at a time. Although it is possible to have bipolar in which your symptoms flare all of the time, this is really the rare case. 

If you don’t get help for bipolar, your condition is likely to continue to worsen. There is no doubt that depression itself is a killer. Therefore, not getting help is simply not an option. But, the good news is that there are medications, treatments and therapies that can help to reduce the symptoms and help you to cope with your condition.

1211,10n3qdz,Is it ok to not medicate?,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II late last year, after years of cycling through hypomania and depression. I was diagnosed because I noticed what was happening to me, I researched it, and asked a psychiatrist for help. However, also being autistic, I am quite sensitive to medications. I used to take SSRIs for depression and those only made me feel worse, for example. So I am very hesitant about taking medication for BPD.

All that being said, my main hesitation comes from the fact that I seem to be managing my symptoms without negative impacts on my life. I don’t make poor choices or do things I regret while hypomanic. My brain just feels electrified and everything seems interesting and fun. I’m aware many people take up new hobbies during this phase and then later drop them but I tend to either stick with the new things I pick up during hypomania or at the least, put a pause in it and return to it when next I feel able. Depression always comes back. 

But now I see that neither one lasts forever. I will feel the worst I’ve ever felt and I now tell myself “it’s ok, it’s because of the BPD”. And sure enough, I can ride the wave until it passes. And when mania returns, if I feel inclined to make a purchase or something, I can tell myself “it’s hypomania. Wait and think this through a bit.”

This approach, along with proper research, some new vitamins and supplements, and exercise, has helped me a lot with these cycles. So do I even need to bother with medication?",1,0
1212,10abpvj,BPD Mania,"Searching those two words on TikTok brings up droves of fakers. Even when it is pointed out that the DSM-5 does not list it as a symptom and if you have had one single episode of true mania, clearly defined symptoms and duration that you have Bipolar one, there are still some that say “well mine is still mania”. 

The correct word for BPD is euphoria, which some are slowly switching too. 

It’s so highly offensive to those with BP1, we don’t post quirky vids of it as it is serious and psychiatrist Tracy Marks even says that the chances of never being hospitalized are slim for those who get it.

1213,z4rf5u,BD correct abbreviation (not BP),"I feel like the Reddit community for bipolar disorder and others (ex: bipolarSO’s)would be less confused for borderline personality disorder if people used the correct abbreviation. If you look it up online the only time it is called BP is in online forums. In the DSM-5 and every scientific article and books I’ve read the abbreviation is BD (bipolar disorder). And has been long before bpd (borderline personality disorder) was added to the DSM. 

Every time I see a post on here with this misidentification it makes me roll my eyes. It’s a similar reaction to when people use the incorrect terms (ex: hypo/mania). I don’t know if people just don’t know or if people don’t care.

I know it doesn’t matter to many people. And I know this is a weird thing to have issues with. But it irritates me to no end. I spent the first 5 years of my journey teaching myself as much of the science behind this disorder and it baffles me that some people don’t care to educate themselves about something that they will experience for the rest of their life. I don’t mean to call anyone out in particular. I genuinely don’t want to offend anyone. I’m just very very frustrated and maybe a lil hypomanic.",0,0

1216,wl3wyc,The expansion of mental illness bothers me...,"Disclaimer because...well, sad world that can't handle different opinions or take anything with a grain of salt. Take it down now! How damaging! I, and only I, decide what misinformation and am the self-appointed, holy protector of those who would be hurt by these words! Based on an arbitrary morality that has no concrete basis or logical grounding and generally was vacuumed-up unconsciously then forcibly pushed on others. Moral totalitarianism at it's finest. Anyways...here:

Don't question your diagnosis. Take your meds. Trust your doctor. Research your illness. Respect and understand other conditions. The DSM5 is legitimate. Psychiatrists are good, very knowledgeable people who might just save your life. Ok phew.

The definition of mental illness has expanded so much in the past 50 years that literally anyone who casually walks into a psych office can be slapped with one or more diagnoses. All based on the holy DSM6 or 7 or 9 whatever it is now. And these are interpreted by ""professionals"" who spent 4-6 years at what are now glorified propaganda centers.

I picked up a book ""The Myth of Mental Illness"", haven't gotten to it but just the idea made me pause. NOT SAYING mental illness isn't a thing...for the ninth time.

I ran around naked, was tackled in the ward, talked to animals, thought I was God, and generally ruined my life...on multiple occasions. Yay meds! And yay for awareness truly. I and millions of others would never have progressed this far without taking things seriously and recognizing the severity and legitimacy of mental illness.

But the over expansion, imho, diagnoses human suffering in ANY mental form, as a disorder and not just life itself. As if life on its own, for any species, has been anything more than a gritty struggle for millennia.

Do you really think ""neurotypical"" people don't have issues? The more I learn about my own neuroses, the more ""normal"" people's become exceptionally obvious to the point where I can only relate to neurodivergent individuals because at least they are honest and have empathy. Neurotypicals just don't label themselves or get diagnosed formally. As if my psychiatrist is some holy arbiter of health with no issues simply because they studied psychology. Yea ok. Probably has NPD.

1217,wkq93y,I'm a leader with bipolar disorder and it sucks,"I just need to rant about this. First off, talking about my body and my intelligence makes me sound like a doucebag. I hate that. I am not humble bragging.

Im basically built like a rugby player. I was one of fhe smartest kids in gifted class. People tend to follow larger men and the fact that Im highly intelligent makes it even more likely for people to listen to me. Every place that l have ever been dropped, I end up running the show.

I feel like I have always had a sixth sense and can really feel the vibe of people and I have always felt something so strange has been off with her I’ve never been able to connect on a humane level and have never been able to open up or trust her and she is not a personable person at all.

1227,q8g5ut,Toxic relationship with bipolar fd me up ..help,"I’m going to try and make this quick, but I guess my hope in writing this is that someone will be able to relate or confirm my belief. 

Freshmen year of hs I was super insecure, but I was happy and had friends. Not long into fm year I started crushing hard on a boy  in my class who was super into himself, SUPER good at swimming and super into girls. He had tons of girls in his phone always. Anyways I was innocent and “fell in love” w this boy. He pressured me into losing my v card and made me do other things I wasnt comfortable with which isn’t cool butat the time I though that’s what love was. Fast forward 6 months he breaks up w m and then desperately cried for me back. We get back and I find out he has sex with another girl (his sisters friend at a sleepover at his house). We break up, he has more sex, lies about it, and we get back together. He would creel me how depressed and suicidal he was and all these things he promised I keep to myself (one of the times he all allegedly cheated one I told his mom abt his suicidal ideas as I should have). He would say that if I don’t stay with him he’s going to kill himself and would drive like 100 mph when he was upset to scare me, he was diagnosed w bipolar sophomore year which made sense and later he was sent to rehab but These made me feel obligated to stay w him bc he was at a vulnerable time.. it was a VERY emotionally draining and toxic and this went on for 4 years.
Anyways I would always go back to him bc no matter how bad he f d up he would always say “if you really love me youd work through it with me”. And I needed up sheltering myself off to just him my senior year. 

We break up when we go off to college and I have my first manic episode at college, like close to a psychosis and I get diagnosed with bipolar 1. Looking back, I can only place my reasoning for my episode on this relationship. I have no childhood trauma and no family history of mental illness AT ALL. I am in an credibly loving and supportive family but I can’t seem to get over how this could have happened to me. If anyone reads this, could this be a logical reason ? I know bipolar isn’t contagious but I can pinpoint the time my mental stress began is when I started seeing him.",0,0

1231,ldx1ll,Reconnecting with nature and moving our bodies can help with our mental health issues!,"As humans, we were born to be wild.

We were born to move, to explore, to play, to be in nature.

It’s in our DNA.

If you think about it, our first home was the earth 🌍There was a point in time, long. long ago, when earth was all we had. Until we started building, no one was born with shelter- our first floor was the dirt and our ceiling the sky. Our decor the trees, the flowers, the ocean and the mountains. What a beautiful thing if you think about it 💭🌊🌸⛰

So it’s no wonder that being outside in nature brings us a feeling of peace and energy.

And it’s no wonder that sitting at a desk inside all day feels uncomfortable and exhausting.

And it’s probably why so many of us struggle with mental health issues.

Sadly it’s most likely why so many children are being diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and the like.

Did anyone ever think of this- maybe it’s the education system that’s damaged and dysfunctional and the children are just acting in the way they first designed to be? Wild and free- Desperate to move and run around, to be outside and play, yet confined inside to a desk for most of the day.

To me, it sounds like the education system needs some adjusting, not so much the kids.

We are not connected to nature anymore. We aren’t doing what our bodies were originally intended to do.

So we need to go back to that. We need to make it a priority to get up and move, get outside, explore and play! Think back to times you’ve ever done these things- how happy, alive and peaceful did they make you feel?

It’s the weekend. Get outside and go for a long walk in the woods. Go on a road trip, do something that makes you feel alive and free. Make it a priority to reconnect with nature I promise you- you will feel better after than you did before. It will bring you happiness and energy, which is something we could all use during these crazy times 🤍✨",2,0

1241,drds6v,I love being Bipolar,"I followed this subreddit in the hopes of finding like-minded individuals who could relate to me, unfortunately I have yet to find that here. I seem to always be a black sheep in almost everything in life. In my family, work and well life. This is a great subreddit though, people are passionate about helping each other out. I have learned of resources like Daylio to see how erratic my behavior has been. I have learned a lot from other people's experience here and this is just a post to kinda vent out my own experience. I have dealt with this condition for all my life and I did not even know I had it until pretty recently. About 2 or 3 years ago. **If you want the tldr just skip all this and you'll be surprised at how I managed to make such a simple thing into this very long post. I like to talk a lot as you'll find out.**

Everything started to make sense, at first I was in denial, but as I read the symptoms and my psychiatrist broke things down for me, it really started to click why I was the way I was. I'm not going to lie, it ain't easy. I have many days where I will blurt out negative and dangerous words about myself. Due to the verbal abuse of my childhood from my uncle and school bullies. I learned those words aren't really me talking and just remnants of the demons of my past. 

* I usually clench my fists and counter with ""No I am a great person and have a lot to live for. Never has there been someone like me. I am a loving soul who is on this Earth to do good."" 

I knew there was something wrong with me since my first psychiatrist visit in the Dominican Republic. I am American, but my mother and father were born there. I was about 17 I'd say. Maybe younger. I told the psychiatrist that I'm always depressed, I was shy, quiet and always in my own world playing video games for far too long. I told him as well under no circumstances will I take any medication. As my father had suffered a stroke recently that we would later find out accelerated his Alzheimer which he now has. I thought at the time the pills were the reason his mental faculties were waning. And that's why I was so against medication at that time. He instead wrote me a prescription for a book... the 7 habits of highly effective people. And this is where my obsession for knowledge began.

* I figured that whatever it is that I had, the solution to curing myself was hidden somewhere in books. If I read enough books maybe I could fix myself. Maybe I could stop being so pathetic and sad. Maybe I could live a happy life.

Fast forward 2 or 3 years I had my first real life-threatening manic episode. I couldn't land a job and my dad's condition worsened. I was so desperate to find a way to help my family that I started hitting up every single family member asking for wisdom or help in getting a job or some incoherent request for salvation from this hell I was living in. I was not eating and was about 98 pounds (I'm 5'7). I went outside and went to a cop and blurted some more incoherent shit. Next thing I know I'm in the hospital. I knew they were going to put me in a mental hospital and I begged my mom to take me away from there because all that they would do is drug me. 

* That is exactly what happened. It was by far the most dehumanizing experience of my entire life. And it only lasted a couple days but for me it felt like an eternity. My best friends and immediate family were the only people who visited me. My reputation from then on was completely in the gutter and people treated me differently. This is when I began to blurt out the most negative thoughts. To this day after 7 years, I still cannot control this impulse. I will say things like ""Kill myself"" or ""I'm a faggot"" or ""I'm such an idiot"". Either under my breath or in my mind or if I'm home I'll say it out loud. The system in place for mental health care is disgusting in this country. To think it use to be so much worse in the past. 

This is why I do not take medication. I do not trust doctors. I will only take medication under certain circumstances. It really only applies to sleep. But these are the reasons I prioritize sleep above all else.

1. If I cannot fall asleep.
   1. If an overwhelming sensation of what I call ""The weight of existence"" hits me where I fear not for my life but my loved one's lives. The thought that anyone I love can die at any minute. It has only happened a handful of times but this fear is so intense I cannot stand it and just want to sleep to reset my mind and go back to my normal self which is the only solution I find to this.
   2. If I am having an intense manic episode. (Hasn't happened in a long time). Only sleep will return me to my senses.

I also during my manic episode became unable to lie and worse yet unable to sleep, which is by far what I grew to hate the most about being Bipolar. I told my best friend's mother that we smoke weed. My Best friend was not too happy about that as he never wanted his mom to find out. We had a falling out and he said he never wanted to see me in his life. I tried to do things like bring him a case of beers. I apologized to no end. I do everything I can to make amends. To no avail. I come to the conclusion that the only way we can be friends again is if I become a better person and show him that I can change.

My mother then takes me to the Dominican Republic where we meet with a doctor who gives me the first medication I take for this disorder (I still had no idea I'm Bipolar). I gain a whopping 40 pounds within a month of taking this new medication. Something I really needed but within a month, thats pretty dangerous I imagine. It shows you the dangers of the medication they give us. I don't advocate for people to get off medication because it is an essential tool for living a productive life. It is simply just something that I have learned to live without. I get back to my city where I'm from and I go visit my friend. He sees me and takes a step back and is dumbfounded at how much weight I've gained. He still wants nothing to do with me, but he can tolerate my presence. His little brother is also my best friend and never got mad at me for any of the stupid stunts I pulled during my manic episodes. His friendship I cherish above all else and is a good reason I'm probably still alive today. Love is a powerful medicine.

I then get my first real job. My millionaire cousin took pity and gave me a job as a bag boy in his store. For a whopping 8 dollars an hour I would kill myself working for him carrying all types of heavy groceries down the conveyor belt and bagging groceries and helping people get it to their car. It was by far the worst job in my life and I got fired from it due to always showing up a bit late. I thank him to this day for teaching me the value of a dollar. I use to respect him, but have come to see him as a money hungry fake family member. He survived a brain tumor which shows how resilient he is but the way he treats some of his employees, I just can't respect a man like that. Many of my family members are rich. I am dirt poor and I can't lie I do not like them. I consider myself in that position, I would prioritize in helping rise all my family from poverty who showed the drive to do so like myself. Not through handouts but IDK, being treated like a crazy person by these people leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Kinda like how Thomas treated Joker. Most people will grow to fester a deep hatred. But I still love these people, I just wish they'd give me the opportunity to show them my skills.

Well after I got fired it was during the same week I got accepted into a career training program for inner city youth. Knowing now that if I do not do something and fast I will be destined to work shit jobs the rest of my life. Working with my cousin I would always tell them we'd work together one day as associates. This is where my current obsession with becoming a millionaire by 30 began. I came in and stated my objectives and why I chose to do this program. I want to retire my mom and dad so they no longer need to work. They spent all their money on me and my constant fuck ups. It became clear that the only way they are going to retire is if I pay them back by becoming successful.

I put my heart and soul into this program. I read two books that were key to my success in completing the program with the best internship they had to offer. The 48 Laws of Power. Think and Grow Rich. The combination of the two is what I consider to be the reason I managed to come out of the program with an Internship at Google. Before this however I had no idea of how great Google was or it's reputation for the work environment they had established. I reconnected with my best friend a month before I had to choose my internship and pitch to the class why I want to work there. I only had Harvard and Microsoft in mind, but it was my best friend who told me to do everything in my power to get the Google Internship. And now I get to the point where I say why I love being Bipolar. I was filled with so much positive energy and a strong and impeccable faith that I was going to succeed. And that determination got me to experience some of the best months of my life. 

However once I reached this new level of success, I began to get imposter syndrome. It was hard connecting with my bosses. Me being of Dominican descent, and still having an inferiority complex from my verbal abuse growing up. I gradually started to under perform. I mean I landed consecutive internships from 2014 to 2016. But being forced to go to college to continue the internship was draining me. My father had a tendency to go missing every time finals week came around. I failed every single class and my GPA was in the gutter. Just like High School. By 2016 I found no point in continuing my schooling. It was painfully clear college was not for me. I hate school and I hate learning things that have nothing to do with the work I want to do. I want to learn not study. Where learning I do with passion and studying is more of a chore to memorize and regurgitate information onto a piece of paper. 

So I try to just go for a full-time position as one of the other interns was able to land one without even needing to do an Interview. But then I get the news that I need to do an interview. By then I'm well aware there's no way I'm getting the job. I use to get very nervous during interviews and had little to no experience doing them. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong. The invitation for hangouts wouldn't show up on my email. That already wasted 15 min. Then they called me on my damaged iPhone 6. The internal speaker would produce muffled sounds. I knew that my career in Google was over. And I was right. It was only in this year 2019 that I finally mastered the art of interviewing. After failing constantly in many interviews, I learned what to say, how to say it and what questions to ask to differentiate myself from the herd.

Today I still struggle to stay stable. Sometimes I let my emotions best me. Sometimes I say things that end up hurting me in some form. Sometimes I feel very sad. But something that this condition has gifted me is unrivaled positivity and happiness that infects everyone I meet. Through all the books I've read and all the random information I learned because of not being able to sleep. I've gained a power to make friends. Like Naruto my talk-no-jutsu is overpowered. I can make almost anyone like me if I try hard enough. I focus on things that they may like and try to understand them.

I'm now married. I have a wife that believes in me and my potential. I also work as a concierge at a luxury apartment complex. Most of the residents love me. Even the ones who didn't like me at first can't help but like me. I try so hard to pinpoint a way to connect with everyone. My friends are mostly all musicians, insanely talented individuals. My best friend is a programmer whos a certified genius. My other best friends are also talented in music, business and wise beyond their years. A trait we all share due to our collective experience being brought up in the warzone that is the hood and our understanding in the power books have. That's probably a subject for another post in another subreddit though. One of my friends in our mastermind group actually spent time with Bad Bunny recently. Had a private conversation and managed to show him his music. 

Now to finish this incredibly long post which I apologize to anyone who had the attention span to follow this crazy life of mine. While this may just be a symptom of my bipolar disorder to believe I am greater than I actually am. A delusion as most doctors have told me, I've been told by many people growing up that there is greatness in me. Even my former coding professor who is also bipolar told me this recently last month. He worries a lot about me because he knows what we deal with. I will do everything in my power to increase my power so that I can leave this world a better place in one form or the other. I refuse to see myself as a victim and will not make excuses. Action will be the food and drink that will nourish the success I crave so obsessively!

1251,77suku,Got 1% for exam paper. Wrote bush did 9/11,"Question - Am I Bipolar? Thanks for reading 🅱️🅱️


Felt hitler vibes, cos he was bipolar...
Now I am so confused why I wrote what I wrote, as now I feel different. Like I have two personalities and was in at extreme high when I did the paper.

 Mind was distorted, thoughts all over the place. Well when I say thoughts all over the place. The bipolar disorder was evident (even though I haven't been diagnosed) My mind goes in and out of a fantasy world which varies my mood and therefore sometimes I properly answer the question to the point and on the other hand I decorate the exam paper with my political pet peeves. Like saying bush did 9/11, Donald Trump 2020, Obama care sucks... Well it's was sarcasm that I said Donald trump 2020... 

Anyways, would you consider this a serious case of bipolar? Do I need to get help? DO You think I'll eventually get out of control? 

I have fixed by problem of random shit writing in exams by actually studying.

I wanna know if any of you have cases of bipolar and that you are afraid if it makes you break the law or have no thought of morals and ethics.

1253,12o7hxp,is bipolar inherently bad?,"warning: probably a mania induced post. my brain is erasing all the bad things and hyping up the good things here.


my experience with bipolar has been pretty up and down, obviously. but i was depressed before the bipolar, on medication for that, and once the bipolar was diagnosed i was switched meds and put on something else. that was changing around for a while too, my mum and my doctor handling all of it.


and since the diagnosis, since the medication, i've been.. better? i much prefer this to depression. i just wasn't functioning like at all. now i feel like i'm more myself. i'm chatty, sociable, it's like how i was when i was younger. my personality is blossoming instead of being hidden by a cloud of blah.


there are the shitty parts, yeah, but can't those be negated by medications? we're getting the mix right. my mania isn't that bad, the worst it has been is like a week long hypomanic episode. 


it's a lifelong thing, unlike depression which i could've overcome. but if i can manage it properly then does it have to be a BAD lifelong thing? i have so much support. i'm super educated on it all and i can tell when i'm getting high and getting low. i have medication and people who'll make sure i take it, and can tell when i'm not. 


really, i've felt better than i have in years. maybe later it'll all go to shit but right now it's been good for me. 


i'm not tryna romanticize this. these are just thoughts i'm having right now in a hypomanic state. later i'll be depressed and pissed at the bipolar. but for now, why not enjoy it?",5,0

1257,rwx02z,Bipolar husband finally broke my last ounce of self worth and dignity with Manic rage,"
For background my husband self medicates with weed, mushrooms and alcohol and is not consistent with his medication. He spends excessively, sleeps all day and gives very little support to our household. I have been supporting us financially for most of the 4 years we have been together. Last year he got his 3rd DUI and now all driving responsibilities fall to me too. 

A couple of weeks ago his doctor added another medication and after only taking it one day his mother told him not to take it. She does not have a medical degree. I don’t even know if he’s been taking his other meds. 

When he takes his medications he is the kindest man and has so much love for me. These past few months his manic episodes are nearly everyday. 

On the 31st of Dec I had an IVF treatment which is very painful for me (not painful for most). On the 1st I woke and took the phone out of my sleeping husbands hand only to find he has been exchanging masturbating videos, sexual messages and general interest in carrying on a relationship with hundred of women, men and transgender women on Kik, Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp etc. there is also a trail of him paying women to make videos for him too. 

- I believe that people can love any person or way they want to love. My hurt has come from bringing hundreds of other people in our marriage which is monogamous and in a way that I consider cheating. 

I hit my final breaking point and confronted him. He grabbed a beer and started drinking again straight away (9am) and only cared about his phone and getting it back. He said some very cruel and vicious things including that he prays I don’t have his baby and he’s not sexually attracted to me that have broken me. He says he’s miserable and I make him want to jump in front of a truck. 

He deleted me on all apps and blocked me when he got his phone back. He was only without it for 10-15 minutes. 

I called his mom for help and my sister took me away to her house. His mom told him I was harassing his family by calling and asking for updates so the only message I have from him is to stop harassing his family. Now his whole family has blamed me for hurting his feelings when I yelled mean things back and breaking our wedding and engagement photos and they have blocked me from all forms of communication.  

I don’t know if they took him to a hospital, if he started taking his meds and if he’s getting the help he needs. 

I’m struggling with so many emotions. Trying to understand his manic behavior and hyper sexuality, why he was cruel, if he really means what he said etc. the main emotion is being blocked and not knowing if he is ok. Should I have stayed and put my pain, hurt and anger aside to help one more time? 

I’m not sure I’ll ever forgive him but he’s my husband and I want to make sure he is safe and alive. Please note he has not apologized or asked for forgiveness. So I don’t know if I’ll ever be in a position to choose if I want to forgive. 

Any help or guidance of how to deal with this situation or advice based on past experience would be appreciated.

1263,4zrhcq,"Unpopular opinion: Self diagnosis isn't bad, it can be a life saver.","Before I was diagnosed with bipolar,  I had a partner with bipolar. I also am very interested in  psychology, so I was pretty well informed.  I am not qualified like a psychiatrist, but I know myself, and I am pretty well read about bipolar.

At the time, I had a psychiatrist who also was my therapist. I had been on medication for depression and anxiety for about 6 months.  My partner picked up pretty clear hypomanic behavior from me.


I told my psychiatrist about this behavior. going from not being able to get out of  bed, to dancing around, sleeping for 3 hours a day, cleaning for 12 hours without a break and thinking I was the best person ever.

My psychiatrists answer?   ' that's your anti-depressant working.' ( i had been on it for 6 months at this stage)

2 weeks later, when i was back to not being able to get out of bed?

' that's how anti-depressants work, they come and go.'


When I went 4 days without sleeping, and went on a spending spree?

'you're stressed, and you're acting out. basically you're a naughty child.'


When I believed that there was ghosts in my room?  
'it's just anxiety'.

When I thought I was sent by a god to  save the world?
'Well, there's nothing wrong there if it doesn't make you unhappy.'


At this stage, I was very much doubting her, but everyone told me 'she's the expert!!'. But she started to tell me things that were very easily disproved.  like  'People with ADHD do not have sleep problems. In fact, it's well known they sleep better than normal people.'

That's when I decided to trust myself, and my partner.  Later on, I have been diagnosed by multiple other professionals.    If I did not trust myself and my partner, and went with the ""the professional is always right"" dogma,,  I would probably be dead.

I had a pretty bad manic episode in January that my significant other still cries over. He petitioned me into a hospital where I stayed for 3 weeks. I got out and was fine with some new meds that I didn't want to have, BUT TAKE.

Unbeknownst to us, I got pregnant a few days after my discharge from the psych ward. 1200mg of lithium a day, 1200 mg of gabapentin a day, 4mg of prazosin a day, and 900-100mg of thorazine a day.

The whole time I begged my outpatient psych to put me back on Abilify and get rid of the Lithium. She dragged me down hella slowly to 450mg of lithium a day and when we all found out I was pregnant (12 weeks of us all being ignorant of the pregnancy) she finally took me off Lithium completely and gave me 10mg of Abilify.

**SIDE NOTE: how in the world do we go from 1200mg of lithium to just 10mg of Abilify to function. they overmedicated me like a motherfucker, I stg.**

My significant other damn near begged me to abort the kid, and I did. His reasoning was because,

""You're on too many medications, you could hurt yourself or the child, you could go manic and end up in the psych ward again leaving me with the child alone.""

My mother wasn't much better. Her main points for aborting was because of me being plain ole bipolar...she begged me to not only abort the child but to also get my tubes tied.

I'm at a loss tbh. I just found this community and it's been almost three weeks since the abortion.

I’ve only been prescribed very recently and I literally just bought the meds but I’m hesitant to start taking them yet bc I plan to roll in 3 weeks for halloween - it’s my first roll in 2 years and before I took a break, I used to roll ALOT - in raves and house parties and I dabbled with psychedelics, coke, valium and sometimes a mix of those so I knew how much I could handle at that time. There was also a time I was on SSRI (Lexapro) and it really dulled my roll which made me take more ecstasy than I would usually take - totally do NOT recommend this. It was risky and I was reckless. But I was fine, I didn’t experience serotonin syndrome or any other serious effects… LUCKILY. Never experienced a severe depressive crash as well, I just felt physically tired and I felt the tingling afterglow. 

Today, I am more wary on what I take and I haven’t really been taking anything except smoke some pot. I’m really looking forward to rolling again but would just like to know if I need to go off these meds a few days before I roll or would it not interfere with my roll at all? 

PS. I know it’s not recommended to take mdma when on bipolar meds - I’m aware of the risks and I appreciate the concern - but I’m really keen on taking some in 3 weeks, I would like to hear from people who have knowledge or experience about this so I can weigh it out and prepare for my roll.

I am done with this country preaching about their right to own guns and having so many I live in the South, and everyone is a hunter or owns a gun that I know. NRA stickers on the back of jacked up pickups, it’s so annoying and frustrating. 

Now that yet another mass shooting happened 5 (!) of my friends have shared the same exact post that the pussification and lack of discipline has led to too many mental illness diagnosis’s and that we should be worried that those that are mentally ill will be getting guns and shooting randomly. Their solution take away guns from mentally ill, lock them away and medicate them! 

About that, those I’m friends with are very non violent, I’m a very passive person. I used to get angry easily but I was more likely to take off and go somewhere to cool off. I’ve been bipolar since I was 13, diagnosed at 27, married now for almost 9 years. I’m 31 now in cbt therapy long term, I’m on medication and I’m not a danger to anyone. I’m just a mother and a wife trying to do the best I can.

I am SO DONE with the whole mental illness causes mass shootings! Blame the real cause in my opinion kids that don’t care about anyone that’ll kill because they can. It’s not the mentally ill, don’t blame the weird kids, I was a weird kid who read books at recess and stuck to myself because I have severe anxiety and people are hard to get to know. Just because I am bipolar doesn’t mean I’m going to get a gun and shoot up a church or a school. I don’t want a gun I shot tin cans as a kid, I know gun safety, I was taught by my uncles how to be safe with guns. But I don’t want a gun, I don’t hunt, I don’t want one for safety, I live in a small safe town. 

If we are going to talk about gun violence leave the mentally ill out of it until you know for certain that he was in fact diagnosed with it. I’m bipolar, my brother has major depression. My great grandma was undiagnosed bipolar, it’s genetic in our case. There are violent video games blame them, blame parents not disciplining their kids blame who you want but don’t point fingers and make us more ashamed to be sick. I hate sharing my struggles I’ve been told secondhand that it’s an excuse and over diagnosed. 

That’s my say in it, I’m so so annoyed about it and I pray that they don’t take away my treatment, or flag my account both instagram, Reddit and Facebook, because I am sick, I don’t post anything bad but with this going on it’s like a witch hunt out to get us that are sick! ",3,0

You can have bipolar, live with bipolar, manage bipolar, struggle with bipolar, suffer with bipolar and many other things with bipolar. But unless you are a sentient abstract noun, you cannot actually *be* bipolar.

I know this is perhaps a trivial linguistic quibble. I'm sure I myself have lapsed into using this language unconsciously. But it gets my goat when I notice it. We are not an illness, we are human beings affected by one.

On reflection, I think the analogy I think I have in mind is that I find it anomalous that illnesses generally don't have adjectival forms in this way - we never say somebody 'is cancer', or 'is heart disease', or even 'is myopia'. We don't even say someone is depression or mania, we say they either that have those things or that they are depressed or manic.  
   
Perhaps some people have different feelings because a psychological condition is a little more intimate and personal than a physical condition - I don't know. I am not sure how I feel about this line of thinking myself. Friends and family I know are cancer survivors - for a younger member of my family particularly that is something that has shaped and strengthened her personality in important ways; in that sense it is an important aspect of her identity that I hope she will take ownership of and be proud of as she grows up. But I would never wish a potentially lethal, distressing, painful and life-shattering illness on anyone. Personally, especially since we live in a society where we are too often defined too much by other people by our condition, I prefer to register my small linguistic protest by *having* an illness rather than by being it.  
Other people with bipolar will have different preferences and I respect that. I am more concerned with people at large not respecting those of us for whom the locution of 'being' bipolar jangles somewhat. :)

1291,8nwlld,I really hate what kanye is doing right now,"He's probably the worst person to represent bipolar disorder and, honestly, I think his album might be making it *worse* for the rest of us.

There are a ton of problems.  He hasn't talked about treatment or recovery at all.  He is embracing ""crazy"" behavior and making that part of his public persona.  He talks about embracing Trump, his stupid comment about slavery, and saying he's worried about the #MeToo movement.  He hasn't moved away from his horrible behavior at the Grammys.  In other words, if any of these are actually symptomatic, he's **embracing** his symptoms rather than talking about **overcoming** them.

Calling Bipolar a ""superpower"" in this context is awful.  I think everyone has had the feeling of manic energy feeling like a superpower - and sometimes it does fuel bouts of productive energy.  But that doesn't come anywhere close to telling the full story.  And, in this context, it is basically doubling down on his bad behavior.

And here's the worst part: **the most controversial things about Kanye are related to his *stupidity,* not his moods.**

Saying ""slavery was a choice"" is just fucking stupid.  Embracing Trump and the comments he made about the Black community and democrats is just fucking stupid.

Then on the album Kanye says this:

""Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too // I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd  //  Thinkin' what if that happened to me too  //  Then I'm on E! News""

This is just fucking stupid.

I loved *The College Dropout* and *Late Registration.*  There's a lot of emotionally real things he talks about on those albums, and he's much more articulate.  I didn't see any of that on what he just released.

He is reiterating and reinforcing all the negative stereotypes about people with Bipolar disorder.  He brought *nothing* to the table in terms of the complexity of the disease.  His stupid-ass cover art plays into the worst misconceptions of what this disease is.  He is basically putting on a show of all irrational things that people believe about Bipolar, and blasting it back to the public with a megaphone.

And hearing how many people talk about not wanting to take meds because of weight gain? What are your priorities? Don’t get me wrong, it fucking sucks being fat, but the ONLY bad part of it is how other people treat me. Like strangers telling me not to eat things.

I'm wondering if it's alright to mention to someone that you think they may be demonstrating bipolar symptoms? Or that you think they may benefit from seeing a psychiatrist? No one ever told me that, and I'm 34 now... I had to come across bipolar type 2 on my own. I really wish someone would have pointed me in this direction, sooner.

My ex has been working really hard to get his mental health under control. I think he might appreciate hearing this, but he also has some potential Borderline tendencies, with being aggressive at times, and not trusting people. I just think he may benefit from this, and I feel obligated to share, because of how much I've seen him suffering. I was thinking about sending him a kindly worded email about how I was diagnosed, and that we seem to have similar behaviors, with some links to youtube videos for more information.

With my friend, I'm not sure how to say it... or if I should. She's been making reckless life choices since going on Lexapro, and she's had what she calls ""mental breakdowns"" in the past. There's some hypersexuality and abnormal behavior happening. I might just try to continue being a concerned friend.

Here’s what I know: when I’m depressed, tiktok is a soft comforting glowing screen of entertainment to distract me from myself. When I’m hypomanic, tiktok lets me lie in bed all day, racking up dopamine hits in a way that bothers nobody and keeps my bank account safe. It brings me slightly up from depression and brings me down off my hypomania, turning me into useless, mushy state of nothingness.

I've been on medication for over a year, there was a mix back a fourth testing things out but ultimately this was my cocktail:

* **Quetiapine** 200 mg a day
* **Olanzapine** 10 mg a day
* **Venlafaxine** 150 mg a day
* **Sodium Valporate** 600 mg a day
* **Lamotrigine** 200 mg a day
* **Piracetam** 1200 mg a day

So, this combination generally worked well, can't say it haven't regarding my mental state. The thing is that it came with some really horrible side effects killing my self esteem and daily life. Surprised huh? 

I've gotten into obese BMI really fast, I've been counting calories for months along with fasting and just COULDN'T get rid of the weigh gain. I just kept on being bigger, taking every comment regarding my looks really personally and it hurt really bad killing my self esteem. Right now my appetite is way lower. I'm really unable to eat too much, could call my eating child portions but I just eat normally without counting calories but I can easily tell when I'm full. I lost 35 lbs already, which is crazy and people might just call me out saying I MUST be on stimulants but I'm not. I feel so much better in my own skin right now, no longer not taking off my shirt at the beach.

Second thing, I guess it's more complex for men is ED and not the kind of ED you might be thinking of right now, I'm talking about Erectile Dysfunction with a complete loss of libido. I mean my lower part was just not working, completely. Could not get erect, doesn't matter how hard I tried and never orgasmed while on Venlafaxine. I felt like I'm less of a man, just crying about what the fuck I'm doing to myself and constantly thinking about why I'm doing this. 

Moving over to the mental part, I've become a emotionless robot. I wasn't depressed, sure it's a great thing. Neither in a manic state. It's just that I couldn't cry of feel bad about somebody in situations where I should. Like someone getting hurt or a loss of a close one, like it was gone. I became empty, I wasn't feeling bad or good just ""meh"" and ""whatever"".  My mind became slow and I was constantly tired

Once again guys, I've seen how posts like mine turn out. Just because someone mentions being off meds they are hated for it why? I don't think you guys shouldn't, medication might work for you and tolerating some side effects. I just wanted to speak up my honest opinion, thanks for reading :)",3,0
1302,ow8nua,Does someone else abuse bipolar?,"I will start with the fact that I don't take medications, because they hit too hard. I have trouble talking, saliva leaks out of my mouth etc. 

I work as a scientist and sometimes, as science goes, the results make no sense. To figure out what is happening, I need to remember details from papers I have read 5 years ago, or textbooks that I have read 10 years ago. Then create very ""loose"" associations to make up a hypothesis and essentially figure out a novel experimental set-up to to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Normally this is next to impossible. 

I have figured out that I can induce ""manic"" state by not eating for a day. I prefer to call it hyper state. In hyper state, I have borderline photographic memory and have way ""outside of the box"" ideas. 

The issue is that my brain cannot handle it for very long and I start seeing images. First flies everywhere, then bigger objects like cars or animals. That is a sure sign I need to stop, otherwise I also start hearing voices. I say that I am sick and take a few days off. I just just lie in bed and let the depression hit. If I have not used the hyper state for too long, the depression lasts just a few days.

1306,eod320,Boderline personnality disorder? Why It seem to me a diagnostic error and should be include in the bipolar spectrum.,"I originaly posted this in a comment, but I think it could be an interesting post to start discussion...

I see the downvote and I probably trigger some bad shit for people. Wich wasn't my intention. I'm sorry. I dont  want to deny any suffering from people who receceived a bdp diagnostic.  Your suffering is real, no doubt about it. So I'll try to explain more my critic of the bdp diagnostic as how it's  made in the dsm.

 1: I hate the personnality disorder part. lt's written like it's  a flaw from the personnality itself and not an actual illness that the person suffer from. An illness is something  we need to treat, a personnality is something that define a person (so  it's  kind of his own fault).

2: a lot of criteria seem copied from the old hysteria diagnostic  who was clearly misogynist. In that sense, a clear majority of bdp people are woman. 

3: a lot of the bdp person had suffer from trauma in their childhood or later in life. There's a lot of sexual agression, abusive parenting, violence.......  in their history. So many symptoms of bdp like trouble maintaining relationship, depersonnalization, feeling rejected, abandonned, bad self esteem... are normal response to trauma. 

4: The variation of mood may be in a shorter lap, but it's still thymic episode. It fit the original description of cyclothymia by Ludwig Kahlbaum. There was'nt this idea of lower intensity of episode like in today criteria. The main difference was the lenght of the episode. So this is why I emphase of bdp being a sub type of the affective bipolar illness.

5: This diagnostic come with too much stigma. Stigma that are calidated by the medical system. When someone received a bdp diagnostic where I live, they have to do group therapy, that dont suit everybody. ( i personnally like group therapy). They are also exclude from some psychosocial service that could help them because of how they are view by the medical system. Also, the meds are not systematically used and often ssri can be used alone or with only anxiolitic. When there's a tons of evidence that those meds are not good for people who experience high and down, when they aren't paired with mood stabilizer. 

In conclusion, I dont  pretend to own the truth. I'm just highly critical on the dsm over impact  in modern psychiatry. I feel we need more research and a scientific approach detach from psychanalist.

She has been telling me that her ex was someone else. She didn’t lie about what happened to her with her ex, it’s just that, it was a different person. That’s all. 

We have been dating for two months, and I believe she went to their church sometime last month. She also had me think that she is not using Facebook anymore when we met. But, when I got to be close to her family, I found out about her Facebook. I stalked it, and found a guy liking and commenting on her photos in the past. I confronted her about who it was. She said, it was her ex that she had been telling me, but it was just a different person.

I actually don’t give a fuck about her past, it’s just that, it hurts me knowing that she made me believe it was a different person. So now, I’m starting to think she might still be in love with him, or she might have seen him sometimes. But she told me it had been like a year since she saw him. She said she had trauma with that person that’s why she had decided to forget everything about him. She just doesn’t want me to know about him because I’m telling you, the way she said to me about that guy in the beginning was really traumatizing.

Last night, I gave her a chance to explain everything to me because I want to continue our relationship. I told her to explain everything to me, no lies, just all truths. I asked her about the timeline because I don’t know, the timeline of her breaking up with him seems pretty essential to me. I was squeezing her out about the details, I sounded like a fucking creepy investigator, but I just wanted to tell her the truth.

She said she told me everything and she’s telling the truth, why don’t I just fucking believe her. If I won’t trust her anymore, it’s better to end this relationship. 

Now, I’m starting to think to stop this because I know myself, it might get a while before I forget this. I am kind of guy who forgives, but I don’t forget. Ever. But, I love her. It think what we had in the last few months was amazing.

I had a lot of focus on projects I was doing. I didn't like to be interrupted. Got TONS of work done. At the same time I was very touchy and agitated.

I suffer from intense anxiety and agoraphobia separate from the Bipolar/Unipolar depression, whatever it is, and that usually curbs me from any impulsive activities like gambling, drinking, going out and getting laid a lot, but  I do have urges to be impulsive and spontaneous, storm outside into the snow, self-harm, drink a lot at home, binge eat. I don't have any money to spend as I can't work right now (or complete school) because of the extreme level of my anxiety (which might be related to trauma in my past). However, this state feels like a COMPLETE switch from my depression, not just a couple of good days here and there, which is why I think it might be hypomania. Just a few days ago I went from feeling hopeless, exhausted all the time, no motivation to do anything to a  sudden surge of energy, creativity, motivation and focus and the compulsion to just do spontaneous/impulsive things (within the comfort of my home). (My libido has also risen from the dead for some awesome Skype-sex with my boyfriend last night). This has happened several times, fairly infrequently compared to the length and frequency of the depressive episodes.

I'm going through one of those episodes right now, and my self-confidence feels like it's through the roof, and I feel great compared to the depression. I feel great, happy, more elated than I have in my life ever. I'm having trouble sitting still and want to work on big projects. I'm in an outpatient program right now and I literally could not sit in class because of my need to ""do something"". 

Has anyone had unipolar depression where they felt like this infrequently? I know my possible hypomania isn't as extreme with the impulsiveness as some other people, but it's so, SO different from my depression and lasts for weeks before the depression comes back and it's like an off-switch to my on-switch I'm experiencing now.

I don't want to feel like I'm clinging on to a Bipolar diagnosis, it's just I want to make sure I'm getting the right treatment and know if something is possibly going to affect me for life.  

Does this sound familiar to anyone who is sure they are Bipolar II? I know none of what you guys say is a psychiatrist's final decision, but I've had one psychiatrist give me the diagnosis, the other one go along with it until I mentioned my intense anxiety today, and now I believe he's considering that what might be ""hypomania"" is just anxiety.  But I personally feel that it's not. My anxiety feels different, and I get it just as intense when I'm down as when I'm up. The elation and energy is something that doesn't come along with my anxiety during depression, and it's definitely present during these episodes.

Sorry for the text-wall. Any ideas?

Not sure if this is where this happens, but need some advice. Diagnosed rapid-cycling bipolar the other day, put on mood stabilizers (epilum) & then gonna get on anti-depressants next week.

1353,3alm7h,Do I have bipolar disorder? 20/M,"First off, sorry for breaking the 'do not attempt to diagnose yourself' rule, but I feel like people here may be able to provide some insight.

The first time I experienced any real mental health issues was about 19 months ago. It all started with insomnia - I became unable to sleep for more than a few hours on most nights. For a while this didn't really affect me that badly, while a little sleep deprived I maintained a relatively good mood most of the time.

Inevitably though, the insomnia began to take its toll on life. My attendance at university slipped drastically, and when I did make it into lectures or tutorials I would be far too sleep deprived to absorb any knowledge from it. So I made an appointment with a local GP and was prescribed some sedatives.

This helped with the insomnia, moderately, but I soon began to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression. These worsened over the course of a couple of months and culminated in undoubtedly the worst mindset I have experienced to date. I experienced frequent panic attacks; terrifying sleep deprived delusions in which I would stare at myself in the mirror and watch my face morph into completely different shapes and forms; a pervasive feeling of hopelessness and frequent thoughts of suicide. I went to see a GP and was diagnosed with insomnia, depression and anxiety and prescribed an SSRI.

I took the SSRI for about 9 months after this. It got me out of the bad place I was in, but I didn't particularly like how I was while taking it either. My anxiety was gone, but to the point where I didn't particularly care about anything, including things that I needed to have some degree of concern about in order to function. This care-free stupor was punctuated by brief hysterical lows in which I would feel intense suicidal feelings - worse even than those before I had been taking medication. This would occur once every couple of weeks, and last only a day or two. While in this state I would do things such as plan ways to kill myself (and come very close to going through with them on occasion); cry hysterically in front of family members; or take cocktails of prescription medications in high doses which I took from my stepdad's medicine cabinet. I knew this would either get me high in some way or potentially do me some damage depending on the particular cocktail, but at the time that seemed like a pretty good deal either way.

So eventually I discontinued the antidepressants, probably around 9 months ago. I'm very glad to say I've not experienced anything like the first depressive phase since then, but my mood is still a little unsteady.

I still struggle with insomnia, but it comes and goes and is usually somewhat more manageable. My mood these days is quite varied though. Most often I feel a little low - not severely depressed like before, just not particularly happy or enthusiastic about anything. When I'm around friends I perk up a lot and often have fun, and as a result I try to avoid spending time alone as much as possible. When on social outings with friends I will often be incredibly enthusiastic and energetic; dance a lot; be very talkative etc. I've also had quite a lot of casual sex lately which up until a few months ago I've never done before, and on occassion have been using various street stimulants a little more recklessly than I perhaps usually would.

A lot of these things do seem similar to the symptoms of bipolar disorder I have read about. However, there doesn't really seem to be any pattern to my mood lately. I've read that bipolar phases often last a few weeks at a time. This doesn't fit with my experience since discontinuing the antidepressants. While my mood is rather variable and goes between quite intense loneliness and apathy (only really occurs when alone) and quite intense joyfullness, most of the time it doesn't cycle in such a way. Even if I've been feeling low, I can usually go on some sort of social outing the same day and still be very happy and energetic. I have had a couple of weeks in which i've felt pervasively low and not wanted to see friends as much, but these are pretty rare.

So that's pretty much it. I'd be interested to hear ways in which this is similar or different to your own experiences so I can weigh up whether there's any likelihood of me being bipolar. I know it might be better to go to a professional than to reddit here, but whenever I visit doctors I find it incredibly difficult to describe anything coherently - I just become a stammering mess and neither me or the doctor is any the wiser about what the problem is. I'd like to avoid it if possible.",1,0

A second problem with the word is that it's minimally descriptive. Because of that it lumps together a lot of different conditions. Autism spectrum counts as crazy, but also bipolar II. Maybe it's better to be more specific so people better understand that mental illnesses (in the broadest sense) can take many forms, with many different symptoms and limitations.

1364,2m3b8a,I'm really upset at my pdoc..,"Little history about why I stopped taking my meds to begin with: I've had issues with chronic nausea because of my gallbladder for years. It got so bad that I couldn't take my meds anymore because I was too sick. After having my gallbladder out a couple of weeks ago I started taking my meds again (after about a week so I can confirm no nausea). when i started them again i found that the gallbladder nausea was masking nausea from my medication (viibryd- an antidepressant) So I stopped all meds until I could see my pedoc which was today.

I posted here a bit back saying that I was feeling pretty good off my meds and I knew i needed to go back on them but didn't feel like it. You convinced me that I really needed to get back to my meds. (which was when I found out they made me sick)

anyway, I went in today and let her know that, since being off my meds, I was pretty okay as long as nothing in my life went wrong. when something did though I became overwhelmed, anxious, nervous, irritable and went from snapping at people to crying. I couldn't handle pretty much anything.

Her response was that it wasn't the bipolar, it was just stress, and that I didn't need to go back on meds since I was doing so well. I told her that bipolar people CAN be stable for a while but then eventually we'll hit an episode and then it may be too late. She said that what I experiencing wasn't hypomania or depression (because i wasn't suicidal) so it didn't really count and that not being able to handle anything wasn't due to the bipolar... as if bipolar doesn't effect stress in any way. 

I did convince her to put me back on meds (abilify and prozac now) and there's no point in finding someone else because she's leaving the practice before even my next appointment. But I trusted her and the fact that she even thought that a bipolar person would be okay long term without meds shocked me and really upset me. That kind of dismissal of the severity of bipolar and the statistics of people on vs off meds can kill someone. I definitely won't be recommending her to anyone... ",0,0
1365,2dyurk,SO has been acting super weird over past 2 months. Could it be bipolar?,"I have to admit that I know absolutely nothing about bipolar disorder. Last I ever learned of it it was either wild mood swings for every other month or something similar that I learned from my friends back in high school who knew equally nothing as I did. 


My SO of about 5 months has been acting differently for the past 2 months. About every other week or every two weeks we'll have an *amazing* time together, just the best time of my life, and then we'll have absolutely terrible times together, nothing to talk about. She also goes on upset rants about something I do almost every other day (e.g. one day she says I'm too touchy with her in public, the next day she says I don't touch her enough and wants me to hold her in public more).

She has mentioned to me before how she was recommended to go to a therapist by her family doctor about a year and a half ago, but she hasn't made the commitment yet. Initially she couldn't because of her lack of insurance, but now she has insurance and still hasn't really made any effort to see a doctor as far as I know.

We've been on a very bad road for the past month and a half and it sounds like we're at the make/break point. Honestly at this point I'm not so much worried about myself as I am about her/her future -- if this is some kind of bipolar disorder I really want her to be seen by a doctor but I don't know how to word it without it basically meaning ""you're crazy"" (which, incidentally, when I jokingly said that to her before, she became really upset). I'm not even sure if the things I described above could be some symptom of bipolar disorder or if she's just a really needy girl who has to have everything perfect.

My mom, stepdad, and husband died in the same 6 months in 2020.  I was diagnosed and had my first severe manic episode 6 months later.  

I know Kanye West was diagnosed after his mom died, and Pete Davidson after his dad died.

Makes me think there’s a grief connection- what’s your story?

However to sell their drugs like Latuda and Vraylar and Rexulti, they use the word bipolar, and you want to know why? Because saying Manic Depression like that on TV is scary sounding, where bipolar is a much less harsh name to use and it is just safer for them to call it bipolar to not scare anyone to try their stupid meds to begin with.

Also I have noticed all med commercials show theses newer meds and not the actual ones that have been working for decades. Those are proven and work. Newer meds give a ton of side effects as well.What do you all think about this; Just IMHO.",1,0

1388,uvq1x4,"My creative writing final, titled ""It Was the Worst of Times"""," 

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of energy, it was the age of weakness. It was the epoch of euphoria, it was the epoch of despair.

Charles Dickens’ echoes through my head when I think about Gwen. The highs are so high when I’m with her, and as soon as she’s away from me, the lows are so very low. 

Our relationship has been an emotional rollercoaster ever since I met her. 

Walking into that quaint coffee shop with $8 lattes and a cozy library in the back(to justify those gouging dollar signs I guess), was the best and worst decision of my life. 

You were reading *The Bell Jar* by Sylvia Plath, flitting your aquamarine irises across the pages through the lenses of those hipster style glasses that just made you look like an adorable librarian. 

I sat down across from you.

“Are you also a mentally ill fashion writer trying to make it big in New York City?”

God that was a terrible pick up line.

She replied, “Would that make you Buddy Willard? The creepy guy that degrades my writing and exposes himself to me?”

I laughed, because the joke was funny, and because that was the only way I knew how to hide my anxiety talking to women. 

“Alright well if I’m Buddy, would you be excited if I asked you to grab drinks with me at a dive bar instead of to the Yale Prom?”

It took a few minutes of actual normal conversation to convince her I wasn’t just a walking-talking husk of a human, hiding behind characters etched into paper, before she agreed to meet me later that night. 

That night turned into multiple nights of exhilarating fun and authentic connection, and eventually, mornings, with *breakfast*.

By the time you were my girlfriend Gwen, I was completely in love. Not just infatuation, but I really deeply cared about you, not for the feeling it gave me; I simply wanted the very best in life for you.

6 months after I met you in that coffee shop, I was eating dinner with you and your phone was right-side-up on the table when it buzzed from a text message. I watched as you picked it up, typed your reply with a smile on your face, and put it face down on the table. I didn’t think anything of it, but as soon as you had scarfed down your food you told me you had to go run some errands and would be back later. Again, not suspicious.

My perception changed when I logged into Venmo later that night. My friend had requested me to pay him back for the ice cream he bought me the other day. I happened to see her name pop up in the friends list feed, paying “Jason” for “Long Island Iced Tea from a new friend :).” Gwen wasn’t running errands, unless that errand involved splitting drinks with a “new friend.”

I was lying in bed awake, thoughts racing, when Gwen opened the door and stumbled back into my place. 

“Hey babe, sorry I was over at Julia’s place and we had a drink or two.”

It was definitely on the side of 2, two shots, two mixed drinks, and two beers maybe.

“That’s ok, next time tell me where you’re going. I thought you were running errands?”

It took her a second to make up an excuse. 

“I was on the way to the store when Julia texted me, so I bought some wine and cheese and we had a little girls night in.”

That was the moment that I *knew*. 

I just decided to go to bed. I didn’t really want to confront her without having a night to think. She tried to climb under the covers with me but I honestly was very uncomfortable with that. I got up and told her I was going to sleep on the couch because I was having trouble falling asleep and I wanted to watch TV.

The next morning I made breakfast and decided to give her another chance to come clean. When she came into the kitchen I looked her in the eye and said,

“So where were you *really* last night?”

She replied, “What do you mean? I was at Julia’s all night. It was just me and her drinking wine and watching TV.”

“Ok so then who is Jason?”

Dumbfounded, her face confirmed everything that I already believed to be true. She didn’t even respond, she just walked away. I think she knew, that I knew, that she was cheating on me. She left her phone in the kitchen though, and I didn’t wanna leave anything to chance. I unlocked it and scrolled through her texts. I clicked on Jason, and there was a text from last night *after* she came back to my place. It said, “Hey Jasonnn ;) thank you for a good time. I never expected a short king like you to have such a big di–”

I slammed her phone on the counter. 

“Gwen! Get the fuck in here right now.”

“What?”

“Do you even love me? I know you’re cheating on me, was it just a hookup or do you even give a shit about how I feel?”

“Honestly, I don’t think I ever loved you. I’m sorry but I think I just *liked* you, and now I don’t.” 

She shrugged, as if it was some passing remark, incapable of affecting my emotions. But to *me,* it was as if she took my heart and threw it in a wood chipper. 

I dissociated for a moment, violent images of the mass of meat descending into those sharp slicing teeth. The ventricles were spurting blood 10 feet in the air, and then landing on my face and in my eyes. It started red and then transitioned into a deep, inky black. I looked down at my hands and all I could see was black, void of anything but darkness. The murky liquid dripped down my face and eventually blinded me, searing pain radiated outward. I wiped my face with my hands and then I was back in the kitchen.

“Gwen, get the fuck out of my place. Right now. I want you to pack all of your things. I want you to walk out that door, and keep walking. Walk out of my life.”

I grabbed my wallet, put on my shoes, and slammed the door behind me. I headed to my coke dealer’s apartment and picked up a financially irresponsible amount. Then I hit the club. 

The handicap stall looked like a blizzard by the time I got done with it. A warm and numb sensation crept its way into my face. My vision was razor sharp and my confidence exploded into an impenetrable suit of armor. Nobody could stop me. I pushed my way through the crowd to dance. The DJ obviously knew I was there. Every song he played was for me, I was the only one in that mass of sweat and shiny clothing that belonged there. Every girl that looked at me wanted me. I could see it in their eyes. 

Then I hit the slopes once more. I could feel every grain of powder enter my bloodstream, each line further numbing my face. When I left the bathroom I couldn’t feel my body. I had entered another.  I was astral projecting into a celebrity. I could tell that every person I talked to just wanted an autograph and a bit of my time. Every drink I pounded felt like water, like nothing. I wasn’t the life of the party, I *was* the party.

I started talking to this girl that really needed a Commercial Driving License for that *Dump Truck* of an ass. She took me back to her place and poured me tequila shot after tequila shot before we got it on. Hearing her moan with ecstasy only added to my high, every movement of her hips piercing me with euphoria. 

After the orgasm had faded and the post-ejaculatory regret kicked in, I put my clothes back on and wandered the streets. I was coming down off the cocaine and the alcohol had shifted from intoxicant to simply depressant.

I saw a woman walking with her boyfriend, her arm linked in his. The way they talked they just seemed perfect for each other, totally in love. When they got to a crosswalk I heard her say, “Jared, this is exactly how I imagined falling in love when I was a little girl. I really feel like you’re my soulmate.” They kissed passionately under the streetlights, the light perfectly reflecting off the puddles on the pavement, creating a blurry bokeh. 

The words of Sylvia Plath were suddenly in my ear.

“There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in the room. It's like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the opposite direction--every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it's really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and excitement at about a million miles an hour.”

I lit up a cigarette and began to stroll towards the “bad part of town.” I didn’t really walk this way very often but I honestly had no regard for my safety. I just wanted to feel something. Even anxiety would have been welcome, the fight or flight can be exhilarating at times. I craved that blood pumping, high energy, euphoric at times rush that adrenaline can provide. I used to bungee jump and drive a motorcycle because I was addicted to it. Eventually the rush wasn’t enough though. I built a tolerance to it. I also just didn’t have anybody to share those experiences with these days. 

All my friends had moved away and stopped responding to my texts or just stopped making plans with me. I truly was alone except for when I was with Gwen. That’s probably why she left me, she realized that nobody really liked me, and she wasn’t sure she did anymore. It was an easy decision for her apparently. 

I sat down on a beer crate in the abode of a homeless man living under a subway overpass. He started talking about how he was dope sick because he couldn’t afford another hit of smack. At this point I didn’t give a single fuck about what was the “responsible” or “acceptable” decision. Nobody was going to stop me, nobody was going to tell me what to do.

I told him I would pay for his bag if he hooked me up with his guy. He jolted up from his “chair” and told me to follow him. 20 minutes later I had a syringe in my hand and my new friend “Sam” was wrapping a belt around my bicep. 

This was it. I should have been nervous but I just felt nothing. I had no feelings anymore, that wood chipper hollowed me out. My chest cavity had no heart, just an inky black slime remained.

I missed Gwen. She made me stable, prevented me from going on benders like this. Now I had nothing to live for. If I wasn’t ever going to be enough for her how could I ever be happy in life? My family had never loved me. One day they went on vacation and the babysitter dropped me off at a foster home. I was 4 years old, unlovable, but abandonable. 

It seemed like abandonment had finally caught up with me once again. Sam prepared the needle and asked me how much I wanted. I told him I didn’t want to wake up. He seemed to understand and we walked up the road so that he wouldn’t be associated with what was to happen. 

I remembered thinking deeply about suicide methods when I had read *The Bell Jar* years ago. Plath wrote, “The trouble about jumping was that if you didn't pick the right number of stories, you might still be alive when you hit bottom.”

A knife was too painful and there was too much blood(believe me I hate blood that's why that wood chipper hallucination came to mind so readily). Pills were just a pussy move, if it was gonna be drugs I wanted to do something really *bad*, something you really shouldn’t do if you want to live a good life. And guns were too quick, no drama.

When I finished that section, I decided I was gonna make it heroin. For being so bad for you, it's so romanticized by society. I remember seeing this quote from a Polish politician when he was advocating for more sensible drug policies, “A jump from the sixth floor is definitely more harmful than taking heroin, yet we don't forbid building sixth floors.” I think Plath would have asked him at what number of stories does heroin become worse than jumping. She would have had fun writing about that I think.

Sam helped me find a vein and the needle slid under my skin, the prick didn’t even register. I felt no physical pain anymore. The numbness had spread to my brain, not chemically, but emotionally. 

The first word I uttered to Gwen was when she was just about to start a new chapter of that painful and sad novel. I started a new chapter with her and by the time the book ended, nothing was left but a letter from the author. A letter from the author for the book of my life should have been something I put a lot of thought into. But typically that happens on a deathbed, and the bed I was laying on was made of cardboard and broken meth pipes.

I opened the notes app on my phone and I was tempted to write *Fuck You Gwen*, but she wouldn’t have even cared. I just typed out a short will, leaving everything to Sam, mentioning that he was a friend of mine. I typed some identifying information and tried my best to make it so that the police would know it wasn’t foul play. He deserved a better life, I hoped he would go to rehab or something, turn his life around and not turn out like me.

With no affairs left to take care of, I eased the plunger of the syringe towards my vein. The amber shaded liquid disappeared into my arm, making my blood a smoothie of cocaine, alcohol, and heroin. I immediately felt the smooth and reassuring hand of Lady Heroin, she caressed me and told me that all was well with the world. I had nothing to worry about anymore, I had no problems waiting for me when I came back. Where I was going there were no earthly problems. I closed my eyes and reality seemed to “melt” away, the sensations that I normally experience were entirely foreign. Everything was deeper and thoughts and feelings *floated* through my brain as it separated from my body, and soon my body separated from the ground. I visualized myself laying on top of a cloud, drifting by like I was on a lazy river through heaven. The cloud ascended higher and higher until the sky turning into a blinding white, I was entering purgatory. The last thing my consciousness created was a voice that uttered the last line of that Dickens’ novel that reminded me I was in “the worst of times.”

Now I know she don’t like me at all because she got dry. I fuck everything up. All because I constantly fucking confuse friendliness for flirting, I thought since we slept on the phone together on Saturday that she liked me. I hate myself so much.

Also yesterday my friends played a prank on me where they acted like they were her ex and told me not to touch her, and I confronted her ex and asked if it was him and he said no, later I got a text from the same number asking why I didn’t fight him, and I told my friend how he is different in text so he must be a pussy. This “friend” decided to tell me to “stop talking shit” and “chill out” because they told me it was just a prank” earlier and that I “need to listen”. They never fucking told me it was a FUCKING PRANK.

1408,o5cyyb,"Looking into possibly being a roommate with someone that has a BP Dx, any insight is appreciated.","Greetings everyone, 

I’m 19M and finally about to move near campus to attend college (I already finished one year, which I spent attending from home bc covid). I’m not diagnosed Bipolar, but I am NeuroDivergent in several ways. My knowledge regarding anything related to being Bipolar is sort of limited, but I’m extremely open minded and accepting. I might have royally fcked up wording, because I haven’t been around this community before, so please do correct me if you feel my wording is insulting (or even just incorrect for that matter).

It’s time for me to find a roommate (I’ll have a separate room, but will be living in the same apt.), and a wonderful gal (19F) I met at freshman orientation contacted me the other day! I’m quite excited because I’m pretty sure living with them would be great, but there are also some things that I do feel might be important to consider. Keep in mind, while I have met them in person (spent 4-6 straight hours in person with them, and I find we have a lot in common) and have been in several classes with them (we share the same major, which is in the medical field), I’m sure there is much that I don’t know about them.

At orientation, we discussed NeuroDiversity quite a bit and we talked about our different dx’s. They disclosed that they have a Bipolar diagnosis (not sure about specifics), and they have a support/service dog to help alert/ground them when they’re in a manic/stressful state (or something like that, but it’s really difficult to remember).

While I’m very accepting of ND’s, especially because I’m ND myself, I do find importance in having a basic understanding of someone before I make the important/large decision of living with them, or at this point like looking further into it.

I’m genuinely trying to not come off as a shit human being, as I want to ask relevant things in a sensitive/appropriate way that won’t A. trigger them and B. make them feel “less” for being Bipolar. Would it be appropriate for me to ask them the following?:

1. How does being Bipolar influence your life, and how do you predict it will influence you during this in-person school year?
2. How often do you experience manic episodes or other altered states which deviate from what you consider your “balanced” state?
3. Would you need any supports? How could someone, as a roommate, support/accommodate you? 

Are there any other questions I should ask?

Should I or should I not mention it to my parents? (They’re kind people, but I fear that they’re old and may come from a generation that stigmatizes anyone dx’d Bipolar. Maybe they wouldn’t, but I don’t know)

Is there anything that would be beneficial for me to know?

Am I overthinking this??

I’ve taken a psych course & do love to read about psych & neurology, like a lot (but at the same time I recognize that neurodivergence can influence people in vastly different ways, even if they have the same Dx, so textbook knowledge may not always be accurate (which is also why I’ve come to ask this community)). 

I appreciate anyone that’s read this far, even if you find you don’t have the energy to respond. Any comments, suggestions, or criticism, would be duly appreciated, as is your time.",1,0

I'm on the medication combinations that they were making fun of. Y'know why? Because without it I can't leave the house. I can't sleep. I'm paranoid and delusional.

Like right now, I know it's symptom to believe you're not bipolar when you are, but There's a MASSIVE chance I'm lying to myself and pretending to mimic those symptoms

My meds are placebos. I know they are. I've been given them so they can monitor me and prove that I'm lying to myself. I know that one day I'll show up to an appointment and they'll confront me about it and tell me that I'm not actually taking the medication they're saying I am

Even if I am, I don't think I should continue taking them. If they are what they say they are, I don't think that's healthy for me. If I'm not actually mentally ill, I'm assuming that could cause damage to my health and I don't need that 

I'm completely convinced that it's the truth. My boyfriend is saying I'm unstable but I know I'm not. I'm not unstable I'm just having a break of truth and seeing past my lies of it. Soon I'll fully uncover all of it and I'll prove to him that I'm telling the truth",0,0

Being Bipolar messes with my social skills BIG time. I can't make any friends because of it. Especially in my depressive phases. So it gives me social anxiety and it prevents me from doing anything social.

However, I also count being gay as being a comorbidity, because it's just a hugely hugely negative thing that prevents me from living a normal life. It cuts off communication from society at large I think.

Also, being Christian is also a comorbidity to me, because here in California it has prevented me from blending in with normal society. It's hecka secular and antiChristian here. I've lost many friends and have been shunned just because I am Christian.

Lastly, I am big time overweight and morbidly obese.

&#x200B;

My mom has had bipolar since her mid 30s. About a year ago her mental state was in real bad shape, her medication was not working with her. She used to recover for a while and after a week or 2 and she would get another severe manic episode which lasted 1 week while on medication. She used to take Olaweb 2.5 and Depakote 250mg.

&#x200B;

Medication was no help so I decided to do some research and found out about Omega-3 fish oils. I did more research about it and it was really helping bipolar patients with depression. I couldn't find any information on how it affected bipolar patients with manic.  So I though and gave it a try.

&#x200B;

I need to find out the correct dosage and which fish oil would be suitable for bipolar manic patients.  After a few hours of research I found this [page](http://psycheducation.org/treatment/mood-stabilizers/omega-3-fatty-acids/) deep somewhere in Google.  The correct dosage amount is  >1000mg EPA everyday.

&#x200B;

I bought some fish oil from Ebay-Amazn and began giving it to her.

&#x200B;

After I started giving her fish oils everyday, after a  months her episodes became less frequent. From every 2-4 weeks it went to 5-6 weeks, then a month later 6-7 weeks and so on. To see results it took a while and I'm happy that it was working. Her episode severity also kept going down. I gave her fish oils only when she was not on her episode. I used give her her regular medication with fish oil when she had her episode.

&#x200B;

Today, it has been a year and her last episode was 3-4 months ago(not severe at all!). This time her episodes are very easy to control and she recovers within 1-2 days(before it took 1 week) with her regular medications.",2,0

TLDR: Took about 12 mg of MDMA and probably have bipolar III. Wondering if I should expect some depressive symptoms from the comedown.

I think I am on the Bipolar III/cyclothymia spectrum though the diagnosis isn't final (my father has bipolar I and my current psychologist thinks I have symptoms of bipolar). It's definitely not strong, I spent 4 years without a depression (aside from isolated days when I'm ridiculously emotional for no reason). Had my last depression last winter and it lasted about 2 months. Took Prozac for about 3. Manic periods never lasted more than a week or so and I can usually notice and manage the symptoms well, so usually it just leads to some insomnia and a lot of creativity, higher libido and social energy (not normal for me, I'm quite introverted).

Two nights ago I took a small dose of MDMA with a fuckbuddy (I think it was 12mg but too be honest I'm confused on how much, I just know it wasn't a lot, just enough to get a bit high). It definitely had an effect. I was in a very good mood and sounds were a little different, my pupils were huge, etc. I'm very sensitive to drugs (I get high from two puffs and very tipsy from a glass of wine) and it was my first time trying it. Today I feel very energetic (helps that I drank two cups of coffee which I probably shouldn't have), my libido is very high, I'm having trouble concentrating and I've written two poems already which is a lot for me. It probably adds to the mania that I spent the week with a lot of different people and had a lot of sex. Over-stimulation usually leads to mania for me.

So what I am wondering is if I should be scared about the comedown from the drug and expect depressive symptoms. I'm thinking because I took a small dose it shouldn't be too bad but I hope I can hear some stories/advice. Thanks!

&#x200B;

This whole ordeal started on December 31st, which is already my least favorite day of the year for reasons that I will explain. That also means that I've been seriously struggling for all of 2019. So, on 12/31 of last year, I was piss-drunk, as is customary for me at NYE, and I forgot to take my medications. I'd been heavily medicated for five years, and had suffered some pretty significant side effects, including 80 lbs of weight gain and excessive grogginess and hypersomnia (I was sleeping 12 hours a night, which made life very difficult). I had been on Prozac since I was 13, and prior to 12/31 I had been on Zyprexa, Prozac, Tegretol, and Keppra. I've been on other drugs over the years, but those were my regimen at the time. My diagnoses are Bipolar II and OCD, so that drug regimen is a little inappropriate (I learned later), but I trusted my psych NP, so I did as I was told.

&#x200B;

\[In retrospect, I maybe should have been suspicious of her knowledge of BD bc every time I reported a side effect, she added a new drug instead of changing the one causing the symptom, until I was on Zyprexa, Prozac, Topomax, and Welbutrin. Now, Welbutrin lowers the seizure threshold and Topomax treats seizures, which means when I asked her to take me off Topomax bc it was making me stupid, and she did, but left me on a v high dose of Welbutrin, I had a grand mal seizure. That was back in September, and the ER doctors did some tests and sent me home bc my scans were normal. Less than a month later, I had another seizure and another $1000 ambulance ride, and this time they told me to go off Welbutrin and take some Keppra, and I complied. My neurologist agreed to this assessment later, and he and my psych NP decided to add in Tegretol (a mood stabilizer). So, then I was on an antipsychotic, a mood stabilizer, an SSRI, and an anticonvulsant. The side effects were brutal, probably bc that's a terrible combo for BD2.\]

&#x200B;

So, on NYE I was drunk and I forgot to take my medication. That next morning, I was terribly hungover and in my sleep I had somehow pinched a nerve, so I was in excruciating pain. I spent two days sleeping nearly constantly, and gobbling hydrocodone when I was conscious so that I could fall back asleep. By Jan 1, I was already withdrawing from the longer-acting of my drugs, and I couldn't keep anything down (or brush my teeth) bc I couldn't stop vomiting. That meant I didn't take my meds for several more days. I figure now that I was probably detoxing from (accidentally) quitting those drugs cold turkey, but at the time, I was sure I had the flu. By the 10th, the worst of it was over and I thought I was finally over the ""flu,"" so I started taking my medication again (without consulting my psych). This is just the first of many mistakes I've made this year.

&#x200B;

On Jan 15th, I flew south to spend 16 days with my v conservative, v traditional family. I, being a proper northerner, am a democratic socialist with tattoos and facial piercings and I wear Birkenstocks with yoga socks in January. This is important background info bc you'll understand why I'm the black sheep of the family. Most of that side of the family never went to college, and I just finished my BA in English literature, which they don't understand bc I didn't actually learn how to *do* anything. They all work blue collar jobs, which is perfectly respectable, but admittedly different from the path I was privileged enough to take. So, I was already unsure that I wanted to continue taking my medications bc I had felt very clear, mentally, and other symptoms such as my compulsive binge eating had gone away during the 10 days I was unmedicated at the start of the month...

sidebar: I'll add now that that was the first time in my decade-long career of taking various psych meds that I'd ever taken myself off my meds without consulting anyone, but I was fed up with my psych's poor management of my regimen. She attributed all of my problems and side effects to lack of self discipline, like telling me to attend Food Addicts Anonymous instead of removing the drug that was causing my compulsion to eat when I wasn't hungry; or like attributing my crippling hypersomnia to lack of ambition rather than the two (2) antidepressants and the atypical antipsychotic I was on; that sort of thing.

So, it was not difficult for my family, which is generally anti-prescription (oh and they're connoisseurs of toxic positivity), to talk me into going off my meds. Now, I'm not disputing the fact that it was ultimately my decision to take myself off my meds, but I also know that I am awfully malleable when I'm in a vulnerable emotional position, and I am generally wont to listen to ppl I perceive as trustworthy and/or able to back up my preconceived notions. But in any event, I went off my meds around Jan 21st. On Jan 29th, I called my psych's cell phone on her day off and confessed what I'd done, and how I was detoxing, and I'd gone off Zyprexa, but I'd left myself on Prozac, and basically what did she want me to do? She told me to stay on Prozac, and come see her after I got back on Feb 1st. I did this, though I now know that Prozac by itself can trigger a full-blown manic episode in someone with Bipolar II Disorder, which, if you'll recall, is me. The most hedonistic month of my life ensued.

I had a really awful yeast infection for the first full week of February, but I got myself off mentally by giving my husband very enthusiastic oral sex. I had watched some such porn, got myself nice and baked, and then went about it in an entirely new fashion, with far more emphasis on teasing, and a fair amount of kissing, licking, and ball-squeezing. He didn't seem to mind at all, maybe bc I was showing him a more extroverted side of myself and that excited him, or maybe bc I was sexually excited about him again; it probably doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

Around the 11th, I was feeling really horny and I was (quel surprise) completely baked, so I decided to message my high school boyfriend, who had ripped my heart out when I was 16, which my husband then eventually mended a year later. P, we'll call him, facilitated my introduction to sexuality. I was in the sixth grade when I met P. We were in the same school play and we'd become friends. He was eccentric, to say the least, even for the north. We were 12 and he wore suits to school, which I thought was adorable. I've known for years he was/is really a douchebag, but at the time I was impressed by his knowledge of Beatles music and anime. Our relationship was always incredibly volatile--lots of fighting and disparaging remarks--but at the time I thought that was normal bc that's how my parents had been. Obviously it wasn't as damaging as an adult argument can be, but for a 12 yr old it was always p intense.

&#x200B;

I do remember the first time I ever felt physical arousal was while talking to P on IM. He told me I was beautiful, and I felt a sharp pang in my clitoris. As we grew up, he always had a girlfriend, and my friends and I regularly heard stories about his escapades. Some of my friends even participated in the stories. Tbh I'm not entirely sure why he wasn't an incel bc he was a total nerd and/or twat, but he was decent looking, p popular in our circles, and very sexual. It was probably an American Pie Band Camp kind of thing. We were theatre geeks, and we all hooked up with each other.

&#x200B;

I wasn't involved in his sexploration until I was in 8th grade and he was a freshman in HS. We both did theatre, which was how we had met two-point-five years prior, and I had gone to his show the previous month, so he came to mine in May of that year. He worked the curtain, and we exchanged flirty glances the whole night. When we were cleaning up the lunchroom (remember, I was still in middle school, so our school plays were performed on the cafeteria stage), we walked past the bandroom and he pulled me into the alcove with the instrument lockers and we made out. I pinned him against a tuba locker and stuck my tongue down his throat, which other boys had liked, but he didn't. Afterward, he told me I was ""too enthusiastic."" We went on one date, and then we didn't talk again seriously until I was a sophomore in HS. In the interim, I had several boyfriends, but no one serious. I had not yet been in love.

&#x200B;

I had a brief emotional affair with a 22 year old college man when I was 14. I realize now how inappropriate that was, but at the time I was just thrilled to receive the attention.

D fixed my car and we went on dates and made out, but I was never serious about him. He told me last year he was in love with me for years, but I honestly never knew.

T left his girlfriend of 2 years so he could ask me out when I was a freshman and he was a senior at a different HS. We dated three separate times over 3 years, and he ended up falling in love with me, too, but he didn't tell me that until years later, after I was engaged. He was the first man who ever touched my vulva, and he fingered me under my red sundress in a park in broad daylight in the middle of summer with lots of people around. This revealed my penchant for exhibitionism, but that is a story for another day. He won't talk to me to this day bc I was his first love and his first heartbreak.

\[I kissed, in total, before I met my husband, 47 people. This included boys and girls; friends and boyfriends and friends' boyfriends and girlfriends; and even my stupid-hot stepsister. I was a foreplay nymphomaniac.\]

&#x200B;

Then there was the captain of the football team, with whom I had a very serious--and often risque--flirtation. He wanted to date me, but my heart belonged to P, and drama ensued.

I'll explain that in a moment, but first I have to disclose something: I had an abusive childhood, and I had been medicated for depression since age 13 (diagnosed at 8 yrs old), so I was mentally unstable already, but I became hypersexual during puberty when I discovered the intoxicating sexual high of having a boy/man wrapped around your finger. I had to grow up quickly, and though I was only a young teenager, I was very sexual. This, coupled with p intense features (square jaw, high cheekbones, and chin-length raven hair) got me p much anything I wanted. I've gained 80 lbs since then, so I am not nearly as attractive, but trust me when I say I was desirable. I looked legal, but around town my nickname was ""jailbait."" I only remember 1 man ever rejecting me, and it was bc he didn't feel the age gap between a 13 year old girl and a 19 yr old man(let?). At the time, I was disappointed, but I'm now grateful that he didn't take advantage of me like so many boys and men wanted to and/or did. I acknowledge my part in my actions, but it's not like I was making out with brick walls; these were 19 yr old boys sending me dick pics when I was 13. They were not without fault, regardless of whether or not I was a cocktease.

So, the school quarterback/football captain (R) was in my sophomore year math class, as was P. The first day of sophomore year, I walked into first period and P was sitting by the door. R was at a table in the middle of the classroom, but we hadn't yet met. I sat next to P, and that was my seat for the next four months, during which time we secretly dated.

One day in mid-September, P called me and we laughed about our shenanigans with friends in middle school and reminisced about how crazy we'd been for each other, and how disappointed we were that we had never made it past first base. By then, I'd been masturbated by T, but I'd never experienced an orgasm with another person (though my personal record was then 9 consecutive orgasms, at the hands of my vibrator, of course). I figured with how skilled P was with arousing me in conversation, he'd be decent in the shee--oh, well, we did it in a forest, not in a bed, as we were teenagers and had to at least attempt to hide the fact that we were sexually active, though I'm sure our parents knew what we were doing.

&#x200B;

We started by meeting for coffee and ended up making out behind the parking lot. Another time, we walked to the forest behind my neighborhood and kissed, topless, on a low-sitting tree, with me on his lap. He was the first person to have seen my breasts (girlfriends had, but not romantically) and I asked him to bite me; softly, at first, but then the force increased. I was in Heaven, moaning so loudly a man walking his dog nearby came to investigate and we had to hide. P started with biting my nipples, but I ultimately ended up with bruises all over my torso, and I proudly wore turtlenecks for two weeks, enjoying my secret. I dropped suggestive hints and flirted with him in front of our friends, but we hadn't told any of them what we were doing. Then, he started telling me he loved me, and I was in paradise. I loved him, too. I realized I really did; I was in love with him. It confused me when I first realized how I felt, but after saying it in my head three times ... ""I am in love with P"" x 3 ... it felt real in that way that painfully true statements often do.

I ramped things up by inviting P over to my house while I was home alone. I had just had my wisdom teeth removed and I was high on hydrocodone, so we couldn't swap spit, but we spooned while watching TV for three or so hours, his cock hard in my backside the entire time. I pressed backward intermittently, rubbing my butt into his crotch. Then, I'd give him 15 minutes to concentrate on the series, and then I'd surprise him again. I got off on knowing how much he wanted me, and he couldn't have anything.

&#x200B;

When my mouth healed, we met again, back in the forest. I was a bit melodramatic, so that night I was wearing some of my black lace lingerie under my pajamas (which happened to be black satin, but that wasn't intentional) bc I was feeling myself that night. He texted me and said he was outside and told me to meet him and we'd go to the forest, so I wrapped myself in a blanket and grabbed my only boots, which had a 5 inch heel (btw, that's not generally good for tramping through the forest without a trail). I was an embarrassingly over-the-top teenager tbh.

&#x200B;

It was 10 o'clock in late November, so it was pitch black outside. He led me by the hand through the forest and we laid down my blanket in a bare patch. We sat down, and immediately commenced the snogfest. I pulled off his coat and his shirt so that I could kiss his chest, which was unimpressive, but I was in love. We kissed that way for a bit, and then he flipped me onto my back and hovered over me before pulling off my pajama bottoms. He pulled up my top so that he could kiss my mons, above the line of my thong. This was a completely new experience, so I was already bucking my hips. He pulled off my panties and kissed my clitoris. He licked in varying settings for maybe 10 minutes before I got bored and took back control. He did not give me an orgasm, but I wouldn't expect to cum from my first experience with oral sex. I was still figuring out what turned me on at that age, and I later realized that I can only orgasm if my legs are spread very widely. Also, my pelvic floor muscles have to be clenched, preferably around a dick, but it's not entirely necessary. We kissed and held each other for a while, but we eventually gave up and P walked me home.

&#x200B;

We met one more night that week, and we French kissed in the backseat of my car, parked on my street. We listened to jazz and he fixed my stereo. I felt his cock through his underwear, but I was too afraid to do anything with it, so I mumbled an excuse, and didn't press the issue. He left and I went to bed unsatisfied.

&#x200B;

The next morning, I wore a long black vintage satin dress, with black pumps, a knotted string of pearls, a cat eye and red lipstick. I also curled my short hair, so in all I looked a lil like a flapper. R went crazy. I sat on his desk before class, as I had several times before, but this time I sat right above his lap, and looked him straight in the eye, fluttering my eyelashes. I pulled out all the stops in a misguided attempt to make P jealous, as I felt like things were sizzling out and I needed to regain his attention. Unfortunately, R's girlfriend witnessed our flirtation, and that caused problems for him, but I try to remember that he was an enthusiastic participant, so I can't be blamed for everything.

&#x200B;

As you've probably guessed, it backfired, and P essentially ghosted me, but like 2011 style, which meant ignoring my google chats and text messages. I moved away later that year bc of family issues, but I was so glad to be away from that whole situation. After he broke it off with me, he told me he had never loved me, and essentially that he had used me to play with. He then told all of our mutual friends that I had begged him for a purely physical relationship, and then became obsessed with him, and when he broke it off, I started stalking him... they all stopped talking to me. It was probably the loneliest time in my life; I had gone from being one of the ""popular kids"" in middle school to having 3 friends all because (as I saw it) of this jackass. I felt utterly defeated. When I moved away, I tried to forget about him, and I met my husband and moved on, but obviously I didn't forget about him, bc I messaged him on February 11th.

1461,aby6gm,The blind leading the blind,"I guess this is my first and last post of 2019 on reddit in the community. I am sure that there are some productive and positive  people with bipolar out there and on here. Before the end of 2018 I didn't want to believe anything was wrong with me. I didn't want to take the label, I wanted to be the old me. I didnt want to talk about mental illness, I didn't want to believe something so intangible can be real but it is. 
I barely made it to my 27 birthday, and on the way there I noticed how unconscious I've been my whole adult life. Nothing mattered to me I never really had a sense of family leaving home at 17 being abused physical and emotionally unstable trying to hide it all in a suit and tie and just grind. Dropping out of college, alienating great friends, believe it was me against the world led that to my reality because now it is. 
I've assassinated my character and it's the hardest thing I see for me to rebuild what took me 27 years to establish. I have no idea where to start, maybe I do but my shame and fear is crippling.  

But through all this I've kept a positive attitude going in and out of depression,manic episodes filled with rage. Through all this I know if I wake up I have to make the most of every single day as conscientious as possible. 

In 2019, not that the year matters but today, tomorrow and the tomorrows after that, I'll make sure that. I am here, present and now.

Reading the stories on here have made me notice. That while we are all a victim of something or someone that mentality isn't going to get you anywhere besides a pity part with others. I hope you all stay strong, stay balanced, stay positive and stay blessed.

Also, lets be honest most of us have probably gone off meds, I sure have, its gone batshit wild, but I've done it and can understand why he does.

The reason why he's my role model is because he embraces his illness, and is proud of it.

He is also a genius and if you've listened to his music its hard to deny, and it inspires me that even someone with this disorder can achieve and create what he's created. He gives me hope.

I'm writing a story featuring a character with Bipolar type 1. I take a lot of care and caution when trying to portray any type of illness/disorder or neurodiversity since I am someone who had their own issues and knows the sting of being poorly represented.

I've had friends with Bipolar (unfortunately they aren't in my life anymore.) And can speak from that perspective (As an outsider looking in of course.) but that also means I can't ask anybody about certain aspects.

So if it's not too offensive I'd like to ask some questions for the character so I can represent him the best I know-how.

A lot of my questions are to do with medication experiences.

How well do medications actually manage manic/depressive episodes?  Are they still experienced to a lower degree or are they averted almost entirely?

What is medication like generally? I hear it's hard to stick to and can cause side effects like weight gain and emotional numbness, is this common?

Is it possible to tell when a manic episode is coming? I've heard that there are symptoms like a higher sex drive, and a 'lightning under the skin' feeling. Is this common? Are there other factors to tell? I imagine it's not something you can check on a calendar, but is there a 'routine' Bipolar can fall into? (Probably not but I thought I'd ask.)

Please let me know misconceptions about Bipolar so that I can triple-check my character. Are there any sources references you'd recommend? How about fictional characters that you feel do a good job of representing you?

I'm happy to ask any questions about the character if it helps :)

Edit:

For clarification, I can assure you I am not a neurotypical writer trying to make bank. I have diagnosed OCD with an emphasis on the 'O' and highly probable ADHD (Which is currently being diagnosed.) As well as other issues that are less pertinent to this example. It's a story highlighting the dangers of ignored/neglected mental illnesses and disorders while simultaneously drawing attention to horrible ""mental health support"" agencies.

I also can assure you that the story never takes place with the Bipolar character's POV. His entire arc focusing on his bipolar is through his friend witnessing it (Which is someone whose shoes I have been in.) I'd never feel comfortable writing from a perspective I can't see myself in/haven't experienced, especially if it's something so personal as a mental illness.",10,0

1496,13e7m7h,Hyper-sexuality,So I am a 23F and have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for the last 4 years. When I enter a manic episode I get hypersexual and not necessarily with him. I have never actually done something with someone else but my body and my mind is wanting more. Like he is not enough. I love him I truly do but is there anyone who can relate and how do you cope?

1501,10tungx,I feel like my life has been stolen,"Hi y’all! I’m 31 (non-binary) and have been diagnosed since I was 29. I recently ended up in the hospital for another inpatient treatment and it was a terrible experience. After I got out I was determined to work hard to reduce my episodes. I don’t want to end up suicidal again. I’m taking my meds every day because before I was skipping 3 times a week so I could drink and be out with my friends.

However, I’m struggling because it feels like this disease takes away everything that made life feel more full.

Things like going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day feels stifling to my social life. I know it’s so important but I hate missing out on time with my friends because their activities all take place later in the evening when I need to sleep.

I’m completely sober and have been for 24 days but I miss going out with friends and having fun. I used to go out to raves in my early twenties (and yes, I did recreational drugs and drank). I never overdid the recreational stuff but totally abused alcohol. I miss taking LSD or mushrooms with my friends or by myself and having my whole attitude about life shifted afterwards for the positive, however I know that these activities lead to episodes.

I am stopping caffeine and I completely stopped smoking weed which was my primary way of relaxing after work. I miss weed especially but I’m trying to stay strong and stay stable.

I feel like a wet blanket and a child. I hate that I can’t do things late at night anymore, I hate that my medication means I cannot go out with friends and party with them. I hate that certain friends never hang out with me anymore because it’s boring compared to their other friends and activities.

I feel like people take for granted the freedom they have in the every day lives and I’m becoming more and more resentful and stuck in this depressive episode because it feels like everything is being taken from me.

I’m so frustrated and don’t know what to do. I want to do the things that help me control my illness but I feel like my life has been stolen and it’s not worth living if I have to live like a child with a bedtime and dietary restrictions and without the spontaneity that I used to have in my life.

How do I get through this?",0,0
1502,10nyui0,I want to marry my imaginary girlfriend.,"Hi I was grown up in a very strict family and I was never allowed to have female friends. My paranoid mom always kept me away from girls . My childhood was also very bad . Then at the age of 16 , I created an imaginary girlfriend to give me mental support. I know that she is imaginary. She always helped me through my difficult times , she has always been my best friend. Now , I want to marry her , I will not tell anyone about our marriage. But I have a concern . My concern is that I and always scared that my psychiatrist will lock me up if they ever find out what I am doing . I also worry that my psychiatrist will diagnose my with a mental illness or something like that( I am already diagnosed with bipolar 1) and will give me very powerful meds that will eventually kill me . But whatever the case is , I really love my own creation of my mind , my imaginary girlfriend, I am ready to die for her , all I want is just to be with her . She is my imagination by the way . Now my question is that , will my psychiatrist force me to get rid of her ? Will my psychiatrist lock me up if they ever find out what I am doing ? Will my psychiatrist force me ECT ? Will my psychiatrist make my life miserable? I have only onething to say I am happy if everyone leaves us alone , my imaginary girlfriend doesn't command me to do something harmful , she has been my support through my difficult times and she helped me survive my paranoid mom and careless dad . I love her very much . I know that I am not normal but I just don't want help . Please answer my questions . Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks :).",0,0

1506,zc4caw,I think this girl is going to kill me but I can’t tell if I’m just paranoid. It’s consuming my entire life.,"I used to edate, and 4 years ago i had this girlfriend from across the country. This girl from her city messaged me, and me becoming friends with her/talking to her ended our relationship, and my ex proceeded to ruin her reputation and have her branded as a manipulator and liar from everyone in their city. 

This girl and I have been talking on and off ever since. Recently after we hadn’t talked for a bit, she messaged me from a burner number pretending to be a complete stranger and tricked me into reaching out to her again. 

Our most recent time talking ended horribly with lots of cussing out and insults, as they usually do. Our friendship was always very toxic as we both have BPD and i have bipolar. 

She’s always wanted to meet in person very bad and has always gotten really angry when I didnt want to/couldn’t. This last time we talked I gave her my address to mail me something. 

After that during a fight she revealed to me that she has known all of my online accounts that ive never told anybody about and has been stalking my online activity for several years. 

I cusse her out and told her that this was the last straw and that i never want to speak to her again. Since then she has tried to contact me 4 times and i have told her to go fuck herself each time. 

She scares me, she openly cheats on her bf and unapologetically lies and uses people a lot. I think she’s really mad at me for being mean to her and making people she knows irl not like her. 

And now she has my address. I am so constantly scared 24/7 that out of nowhere im gonna see her or one of her goons with a weapon and get shot or stabbed.

i need to move but i cant for a few months because of money. I’m scared to sleep, leave the house or go into my house. 

Shes never threatened me befor but has hinted at liking violence a lot. 

Am i being crazy? I feel like the only thing that can stop this crippling paranoia is moving somewhere she doesnt have the address.

TL;DR I have pissed off this one girl from thousands of miles away a LOT over the years and now she has my address and I am completely consumed by the fear that she will kill me",0,0

1519,x4b1zk,A change of perspective (YOU REALLY WANNA READ THIS O:) ),"Hello hello community,

How are we doing today !

I have been reading some of the posts in this community every now and then, and every time, I feel I can relate to a part of what you guys say. After all, mental health issues are not a straight forward process, it's as complex as it can get.

However, I am not here to vent and share negative vibes, nor I am here to tell you ""think positive"", cause you know, I am not stupid XDDD.

Anyways, I wanna share with you a bit of what I have been through and the change of perspective that I reached, and I am pretty sure this will only boost your energy even a little, no drawbacks I promise :D.

So, I am 25 yo, developed mental health issues bla bla bla, anxiety bla bla, panic bla bla. A lot of labels from different specialists, but to be honest, it was not as bad as some people, I managed to graduate, keep my relationships, etc etc.

What I want to talk to you about, is the following, A couple of months ago, I had what some call the dark night of the soul, you know, when you feel like you hit rock bottom, and that's it for you, (not necessarily suicidal) but you know, you kinda give up and feel that the world is being unfair.

At some point during that night, I had this thought ""I cannot live with myself anymore"", and it just got stack in my brain, I couldn't distract myself or change my thoughts, that was the theme of the night. And it made me sad, mad, frustrated and every other negative feelings on the scale of the energy levels.

However, being the skeptical overthinker that I am, a thought snapped through my brain,  ""I cannot live with myself anymore"" is more than it looks like, follow up with me, there is an ""I"" and a ""Myself"", that's literally 2 different people, the I cannot be with myself. THAT LITERALLY MADE ME THRILLED, like which one am I, it feels like there is this neutral creature ""I"", and I think that is what defines me, not the myself.

I found me a distraction to think about that night, and this time, it felt like a healthy distraction, because what I am doing here, is finding my true self. Now, I kept thinking, the reason that I am feeling this way, apart from physiological issues, is mainly external factors !!! (relationships, work, childhood issues, unresolved problems, suppressed / repressed / denied feelings), we all know that that's the real cause of this misery, but you kinda can't do that much about it.

Then I started thinking, who should be responsible of MY feelings, me or external factors ? they are MY feelings, I mean imagine you are having a coffee in a coffee shop chilling, and a random dude walks by and says ""hey, feel sad now"", that's bizarre right? are you really gonna feel sad over that ? hell no! you will probably through that cup of coffee on his face xDDD.

Now, make the analogy, I should be the one responsible of how I feel, I mean it's true that our bodies are stuck with multiple messed up issues, but try this for instance, a very very simple technique that I just want to put here so you can start questioning things. So, Close your eyes, and stop your brain from working, literally do not think about the past nor the future, stop that narrator that never stops in your brain, you can do that, and just be still. You can focus on your breath if you want, that helps stopping the brain from working. Just stop it, imagine that your brain melted and it became a lake, and be still that's it, even for seconds. Well let me tell, you will feel so peaceful, you shut down the engine ! you are just in the moment, not in the past, not in the future, this exact moment. Surrender your body, WHATEVER you are feeling, as bad as it may seem, as frustrating as it is, as painful as it is, it's only there because you are resisting it. Resistance my friend is what causes pain, I mean, why don't you just surrender your body to the feeling !, I am scared ? screw it, I don't care that's my body go nuts, let the fear spread in your body, don't label it or anything, just let it run through with no resistance, and just stay still, no thinking. Guess what ?  that feeling will walk around, here and there, finds nothing and just leaves, and trust me it leaves once and for all, I don't mean it's over no, I mean what you just did is you permanently reduced the fear that is hidden in your self. Fear / Panic / Depression / Sadness and grief etc. they are all the same. I mean you have been resisting them for years, try something else for a change, let it go, you are not gonna die so just say ""then what ? "" 

Now, what can we do with this exploration ? well it's up to you my friend. Personally, after finding out that and trying it out, I decided to work on my true identity, it's not an obsession or a full time job lol, it's simple meditation, simple breathing, simple letting go and surrendering mechanisms. And mark my words, you will build a small base, you will boost your energy enough, so you can think straight and start improving and making the decisions that will make you be better.

I hope I am making sense and I am not blabbering xD,

Anyway, I hope this was even a bit helpful, but I am telling it cause I tried it myself, and I have been in deep shi\*.

Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss this matter, it always helps to talk about stuff and can potentially help you :D

Be safe,

I love you all",0,0
1520,wfrdx6,"I may be insane, or perhaps just human, but....","... I will make this brief. It involves manic-episodes. I am sure it is the same for many, or even all, but my processing power seems to increase, beyond measure, while manic.

Question: Have any of you managed to figure out a way to induce manic? For me, after an episode, I am absolutely exhausted. But, during it, I am able to think much, much clearer. I have many interests, most of them involve our psychology. Having been through so much, nearly taking my own life, and having to deal with the loss of so many loved ones, many to suicide, I am determined to learn how to , again, induce this state of ""higher-functioning"", in order to gather my thoughts about this ""problem"" we all share. I am tired of feeling like shit, unable to gather myself long enough to make sense of the my thoughts. I am no long depressed, but the fading of it was , I believe, due to the fact everyone I once counted on , shit all over me. Im not here for a pity-party. More than anything, it is absolutely wrecking me to know so many who suffer from past experiences, only to tell themselves they will ""get through it"", when all they do is ignore it. Most I know develop a heavy drug addiction, or bury themselves in work.

I'm not even sure if this was all constructed correctly, but I feel that my pain would be alleviated if I were to be able to ""slip a switch"", so that I can push my mind to work this out. The guilt I feel is horrifying. What I feel, mostly, is numb, but it pales in comparison to the guilt of even the slightest possibility that something could be done.

I don't wanna go into it all but it was some god awful things that I would never ever say to a person I don't know or to a person who my husband participated in acts I'm disgusted with the messager over.

The things she said and called me where huge triggers. For my addictions and it will just debilitate me.

They blasted my shit on Facebook so I raged and posted hers on Reddit. I'm stupid.

I'm not on the spectrum. But everyone kept asking me what the fuck was I thinking and the wife may have been psycho but I was wrong and I really did not see anything wrong with it. I thought it was just a nice message. It would've made me feel good to have gotten that message. Had my SO gotten that message, I wouldn't have thought they were putting moves on them. I would've have taken the message exactly how it read. And people were calling me a ho and making huge assumptions, calling me psycho and crazy and no matter how hard I defended myself and laid it out exactly how it was people just didn't care. 

It's my own shit really. I already had all this other stuff going on. So when I got the wife's words in my head, I shouldn't have jumped to reddit thinking people would understand where my heart was and that I am not and was not then this person that these people have made me feel.",0,0

1525,vr7ecr,"Help, I don't know how to grieve my BP ex-bf","Hey everyone,

I'm having a really tough time and I wonder if I might get some insight. It's been almost 5 years since I started dating this guy. He said he was ADHD. Within 3 months he was telling me we had to move in together because we couldn't be apart. Then he started telling me I was too busy for him (I was finishing my doctorate), and promptly broke up with me. 4 years later, I can't tell you how many times he's come back into my life and told me his whole world revolved around me, and that if I just did exactly what he needed me to do in the moment (focus on him over school, focus on him over my new job, eat exactly what he wanted me to eat, take care of myself exactly like he wanted to, followed him into every one of his emotional tunnels without fear, feeling hurt, wanting to be my own person) then we'd be perfect together.   
Well I didn't. I was sick of him trying to tell me who I was and what I needed to be doing as everyone else in my life thinks he's very controlling, and emotionally dangerous as he will build me up but devastate me in the same day. I saved a copy of a sound file once where he was screaming at me, and when I brought it up when he was in a good mood, he got super pissed that I had recorded him. I thought I was protecting myself to bring it to his attention about how cruel he could get. He stated it had nothing to do with the endless love he had for me in the moment and I was a fool to keep it.  
Last year he got me pregnant. While I said I wasn't ready because I felt we were in a really unstable place, he was soooo supportive. A week after he stood by me while we aborted, he was screaming at me and telling me I was always criticizing him and never supporting him. He left me in the middle of a park two hours from home. Again. Honestly after that I distanced myself from him. He scared the shit out of me. I wanted to grieve the abortion together and he basically threw me off and told me in so many terms if only ""I'd followed his emotions in the early days, we would have been successful and married and had many kids by then"". 

He recently re-entered my life after I gave myself some much space. He told me he never loved me at all, just an image of me, and said he wished my best friend should have been raped, as he blamed them for our most recent time apart. He was always trying to isolate me from my friends and family. And I fought like tooth and nail, sometime in deceit to keep people in my life so I could just have a general reality check when he told me one more time that I was a piece of s\*\*t. But oh wait, he really loved me. The weirdest part of all of this is, he has someone still standing by his side, not in a romantic capacity, but someone he romantically rejected who supports him through everything. He would mouth off about her and how boring and unattractive she is, and say that he wanted me. And on top of that, she has helped him to start a reasonably successful business where he is gaining a lot of connection with others, and notoriety which he loves. It feels good for anyone to be admired. And as he's always felt ""kept down by the man"", I think it's a type of self confidence he could never foster for himself and is giving him a new sense of respect for himself. I'm so happy for that.   
But I feel tossed out like another's days trash. I moved on from him sooo many times, but I abandoned over 8 relationships over the last 5 years whenever he came back. My mistake. But I could never truly commit to him, because honestly I would have had to become a shell of a person with everything he required me to do to stay standing next to him.

I'm human. I'm angry that I see him feeling supported as if it's a measure of what I got wrong, and that I deserve to be alone. And at the end of the day, none of that is true. I tried confronting him about his bad behavior in intimate relationships sooo many times. I tried to stand up for myself. And I moved on, soooo many times, to carve out a human space for myself that I am okay exactly who I am. My accomplishments are great for me. He always tells me he could have lifted me higher had I submitted to him. Every time he found out I did something like travel somewhere great, or made a life plan with someone else, he had to top me, and then tell me to my face that ""if I had just figured my shit out, then I could have been with him"". 

I feel so hurt from the first time in the bed room where he screamed at me for needing a hug or cuddle. To the many times he told me that his bad behavior was a reflection of my actions. I need to heal. I don't even know where to start. I had begun to, to make space, that none of his actions were my fault. Please help.",0,0

1529,v0wh50,What I think is the reason for Bipolar disorder/Mental diseases," 

Written as a Bipolar/not as a Doctor or student. I am an amateur.

What do u think is the reason for Mental diseases?

I thought about it for a few years since the start of my Bipolar disorder.

Why do u get a mental Illness and why don't u get it within 1 year. On google it says

""**Fifty percent of mental illness begins by age 14, and three-quarters begin by age 24**. ""

What does this mean for Humans? Does it mean the reason for Mental Illness is other people, that make u feel how u feel?

If you're a kid and you go to your friend and his/her mom tells u that u are different doesn't it makes u feel bad and can be traumatic?

If I think about my life as a kid many life situations made me feel so uneasy and left a scar on me. Mentally.

if u want I can share some stories about my life as a kid.

Can they comprehend? Do they know what these meds do? Are they aware of how serious my illness is based on the amount I come to get?

1541,tvoqia,Feeling extremely violated and used,"So like my title reads, I am feeling extremely violated and used. I am a 28yF, I was diagnosed at 21. I started lithium, Epival, Seroquel, and a tranquilizer when originally diagnosed. I only stayed on that med combo for five months. For two years I was unmedicated and somewhat stable through exercise, routine. Then I was put on clonazepam, which has been okay. My Dr. Retired in august and his replacement hasn’t come from the other province because of the pandemic. I’ve been going to the ER for my meds. Fast forward to a few weeks ago: the dr wants me to come off a bit of the clonazepam (I take 1.5, so knock off .5) Then she added Lexapro. I knew it was a bad idea and she knew I was diagnosed bipolar and insisted it would be okay. It didn’t go well. I was yawning, and the yawns felt medicated, restless legs and then mania. My mania included over spending, binge drinking, promiscuous activities…. Paranoid features. I called the pharmacy and was told I could stop taking it. I stopped taking it and it swung me into a deeper mania. The point of this point was about a guy I met while manic (I’m still manic btw) Basically he found out about my condition quickly and started telling me to “take my pills”, go to sleep… eat… etc. etc. I was coming off a four day bender and he came over and slept with me while I was super vulnerable. I feel used now, even though that was last week. He knows I’m in rough shape and tell me what to do with myself but yet he will— send me pictures of alcoholic beverages, won’t come check on me unless he can sleep here…. Wants me to stay in a hotel room for four days with my dog so I can go away with him to work-even though I have my own career. Work is great, personal life not so great.

I got prescribed adderall and abilify but I have only started taking the adderall because I personally do not want to take a mood stabilizer. I took Lamictal for a week, had bad side effects. There’s other reasons why I don’t wanna take the abilify but don’t feel like getting into them rn. I’ve been taking 10 mg of adderall a day, 5 mg in morning and then 5 mg in afternoon (going to go up in dosage eventually). I’ve never taken a stimulant before so this is new to me. I haven’t really experienced bad side effects from the adderall and I think I notice a positive difference. I feel super happy today… but I don’t know if this is the adderall’s doing or a manic episode. The first day I took adderall I experienced a bit of euphoria for like 20 mins which I heard is normal. Anyways my question is this: is it a terrible idea to just keep taking the adderall and not the mood stabilizer? If I notice it’s making drastic differences to my mood I might start taking the abilify as well. But so far I have only experienced positive mood changes when I take the adderall.

1556,s0ngoz,Writing About From Hypomania to Mania,"Hello! I’m writing a character who is bi polar and I just want to know what I should/shouldn’t include. For more context the character is school aged (16) and she’s met a girl but I think at first the assumption is that its cliche love at first sight, when really this character is in hypomania. I’ve heard some bi polar people say that love can trigger hypo/mania and some say hypo/mania induces love (for as long as the mania lasts). 

So the character starts off in hypomania, and slowly she gets more paranoid/agitated (as she thinks she is being stalked/surveyed) and at the point in the story I’m at right now she is manic, made clear as she goes from not wanting to have sex as she wants it to be more special to just impulsively having sex because every day/moment/thing/one is so special

I’m struggling with how to write the development from hypo to mania. I’m trying to draw off of my own experiences (I have a few personality disorders, substance abuse issues and they have kicked around a bi polar diagnosis) of my high and low points, but it’s different, y’know? I can go from suicidal to loving everything in a day. So it’s hard for me to write more of a slow burn, hence why I’m posting this

So, basically, what do I include to show the mood has gone from hypo to mania? Do I amplify the hypo to a debilitating level, or is there symptoms that are more mania exclusive? For example this character would never drink or take drugs ever (in her right frame of mind), but in her mania she gets drunk on absinthe right away (please don’t do this, for many reasons)",0,0

Fortunately, I snapped back into my reality (no offense to true trans people) and I started to question if my meds are a bad idea.  I went off them two weeks ago and I don’t plan on going back.  I would rather have 6 months of productive and happy times followed by 2 weeks of destructive mania as my psychological cycle than a shitty life and no manic episodes.

That being said I want to get rid of this akithisia, so I can return to work, not making money is making me worse. What meds combos or meds can I ask for?

I can't go to work due to this akithasia, I've been off for a week and I have to make my last paycheck to be able to pay rent, really worried.

Edit: they ordered a gene mouth swab to see what meds react to me in what ways, but instead of waiting they just started prescribing me meds due to a maniccepisode I was in and I believe I'm out of it, I'm seriously against meds but I know bipolar patients should be taking them. But I really think I can do this with just therapy and finding ways to manage this better and identifying symptoms. I'm not suicidal and agreed if I were to be I would go to the hospital to get help. I really think the psychiatrist should be prescribing me meds as opposed to my physician, and I really think they should have waited for the gene swap.

Yesterday I had bought her a small bag with tissue paper that had her favorite candy and a $10 Apple Gift Card. She asked why I did it. I told her just to show I care. She then told me she doesn’t feel we are compatible and that I deserve someone who can love me how I need to be loved in my love language (intimacy) and she needs someone who can love her in her love language (acts of service)(Which I just tried with the bag..?).  She then explains to me she knows I care. Her mom, sister, and step father are all in shock and they don’t understand why she is thinking about divorce. We had been in contact yesterday so I called them to tell them she is still on the fence. They came over to talk to her. When they asked her why she is thinking of leaving she said because “He leaves his pants on the bathroom floor and doesn’t always clean up after himself”. I have been doing better as a while ago she told me it was pet peeve. BUT DIVORCE OVER THAT?  She is walking around like everything is normal. I am having a hard time acting like things are normal. I’m devastated and having trouble focusing on day to day tasks. 

Her plan: her plan is to get an appointment with the therapists and go to 2 therapy sessions alone. After 2 alone she wants us to go together. Keep in mind she just filled out the application so this could be months while I just continue to grieve. In the meantime through Thanksgiving etc she is fine and I’m supposed to not even show that I am upset. 

Everyone is telling me it is either her medication: Lamictal OR she is having an affair/has her eye on someone. The kicker to all of this? On vacation last weekend when I asked what was wrong she said it was with her Bipolar and she couldn’t explain to me what she does not even understand in her own head. I am giving her space and I’m not trying to do anything anymore to get her to snap out of it. I am just lost and devastated.

We (friendship group) still all want to be there for him and support him but, honestly, have no idea where it goes from here.  We've all been blocked on socials and from contact. Can you please advise and provide some insight as to where his thoughts might be? Should we keep trying to send messages of love and support? Most importantly: how do we best support our friend in his time of need when he doesn't think he needs it?

Also probably a thousand more questions that would make this post too long. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated- thank you.

1572,q4efes,I don't think im actually bipolar,"I think when I was diagnosed a few years ago, it was just circumstances that lead to my hospitalization that made it seem that way.

Here is the story. 6 years ago me and my then wife were having problems, I had just broken my foot at work, and couldn't walk for a little over 5 months due to a difficult recovery. I think things were strained between us for a long time and we sort of just had an argument that led to us separating. Literally anyone in that position would get depressed, i just lost my wife and could barely walk at all. 

Was basically just living with my grandparents since I was 23 and let my wife stay in our apartment. One day I decided enough was enough and attempted suicide. Again, might be a bit extreme but anyone in my position would at least be considering that option.

Well thankfully there was a place that could help me where I live and they made me do inpatient for a week while evaluating me. 

At one point while going to group and working through everything i kinda broke out of the depression. And you guys know what that's like, I basically started to realize the situation I was in with 4 days left on my hospitalization. So I started getting really anxious and fidgety. Anyway after the hospitalization I was still feeling that way and when they went to reevaluate me I was showing some of the symptoms of mania. Put the two moods together and you're gonna get the good I'm bipolar diagnosis.

Well i stayed on my meds for a few weeks and then my ex wife brought me the divorce papers and I attempted suicide again. After the hospital visit I stayed on more meds (seroquel, lithium, trazodone, and a few others) well then I moved and couldn't get more meds so i had to abstain for a few weeks. And in those weeks after, i felt nothing. No depression, no anxiety, just normal. And for the last 4 years off meds same thing, just chilling, working, playing video games all that. Like literally nothing negative, no suicidal thoughts, no mania. Obviously a little bit of stress here and there.

Well cut to this last week, I got a new job and get hit with insomnia. Insomnia freaks me out so I start waking up with panic attacks and just anxiety.

I think my initial bout of divorce depression and my week long hospitalization. Along with the meds that can literally cause depression symptoms. Made me develop an anxiety disorder or something which I am currently experiencing.

Basically the only time I feel like i want to die is when my anxiety is bad. I honestly think i just have really bad anxiety sometimes and not really bipolar disorder. I know full well that I might be wrong here, and if anyone else spends 90% of their time not experiencing symptoms too then please let me know.

1575,ps892e,Help regarding my friends physical/ mental state.,"

   Hello!!! I am here to possibly get some clarity on a situation involving my best friend. She is a 22 year old female with several mental health conditions 
  So, we weren’t really talking/friends for about a year. We ended up reconnecting and literally started back off like we were friends forever. So around late June she was complaining about her health. She works a physical job, and said that she was having a hard time at work. She said that she was getting sick at work and throwing up/dizzy and kept having to leave work. So this lasted all through July and into august but it didn’t seem like it was getting worse.

 Late July we were supposed to be leaving on a trip, me, her, and my partner. The night before the trip she went to the ER because she said she was having an extreme migraine. So hours before the trip she had to cancel and didn’t come with us. Since then her health seems to be deteriorating. It started with the intense migraines. Then she said that she has been having muscle spasms that move across her whole body with numbness. It will come in episodes and she will cry and scream in pain. She suddenly wasn’t able to work anymore and took a leave of absence from her job. So she’s been to the ER at least 10 times the past two months, her pcp, a neurologist, and physical therapist. Previously the doctor said she MAY have fibro. 
She had an a brain mri, and I went with her to her appt. they said that everything looked fine.     

The neurologist stated at the appt that fibro can be hard to diagnose and she was not sure if she had it, so she didn’t want to formally diagnose it. Doc also stated that she should see a psych, which at first I thought was shitty to say to someone who’s having physical pain, also she already does see a psych and she is diagnosed with ptsd, bpd, adhd, and anxiety. 
 
Now after this appointment it seems like things are getting worse. Her family sort of in a way told her that they don’t believe her. She has been obsessing over it, and obsessing over parts of her body asking me if they look normal, such as the other day she kept telling me it felt like there was something inside her nose blocking her breathing and she couldn’t inhale. I try to calm her down when the anxiety starts to come out and explain to her that she is okay. 

It’s difficult because I don’t want her to think that I’m not supporting her, or believing her because in a way, I do. But I also think that there’s so much anxiety built up around it that she’s looking for things that might be wrong with her that really aren’t there. 

The other day she called me freaking out and saying that someone poisoned her shampoo and that her hair was clumping up and coming out and that it was fried off. I felt so bad and was scared for her. (She has a roommate sort of that is a family friend) She came over to my house last night and I did her hair for her this morning, and honestly it really did look fine and the same as usual. Her hair felt soft and definitely didn’t feel like any chemicals had fried her hair. Same length, no bald spots, no hair falling out, same thickness. So now that this has happened, along with her obsessing over symptoms that may not be there, I am sort of starting to second guess things. I am afraid she may need to see a psychiatrist and talk with them about EVERYTHING. Because it seems like she might be having a psychotic episode. 

I don’t want to mention this to her because right now I am the only emotional support she has. Her family is supporting her financially also. But I am worried that it’s getting worse. All the doctors and ER visits they have said nothing was wrong and that everything looks okay. So I really don’t know what to think or do in this situation. I don’t know if she’s going through psychosis or something, or if she is going through the physical pain but is a hypochondriac and having extreme anxiety about it. The thing about someone putting something in her shampoo is what makes me think it’s mental.

I had a manic episode as a member took information from this bipolar group and tried to smear my name in another forum and proof my point wrong as I was bipolar, ""You know what that tells us about him"" were is exact words. The problem is its a running forum where I have personal contacts, friends and work who didnt know I was Bipolar, they are asking me why I didnt tell them. I'v made some mistakes recently at work and I thnk them knowing Im bipolar is going to result in my termination. Also my friends have stayed away from me. My life is ruined because some piss ant rich privileged little white kid wanted to gain solidarity with others by showing I am a lesser human. Sound familiar, this is how the Nazi's started. Create fear then ofter safety then you have unity.

This is America and I can sue for Slander and Deformation of Character.  I was hoping other members might know his address and contact info so I can send it to my attorneys and they can sue him but I can't because its against the rules so Im really not asking that. Ironically he has a degree in psychology so his actions were not ignorance but malice.

You can PM me if you would like please. I'v tried to follow the reddit rules but I also have learning debilities and under the american disabilities act am asking for reasonable accommodation, if this post is deleted it would violate this law and could be accountable in the court of law.

Hi. I’m so sorry but I don’t have bipolar. I didn’t find a subreddit for mania and I wanted to seek insight from people who has experienced it before. I’m so sorry if I’m taking unnecessary space in the sub. Please take it down if I do. I’m not asking for a diagnosis but if this sounds similar to mania.

F20
Formally diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder with panic attacks in 2017, and ADHD-C in 2020. Informally diagnosed OCD and childhood emotional neglect caused C-PTSD. Soon being tested for borderline PD. 
I recently (3 months ago) started ISTDP-therapy, but my therapist is on vacation right now until two weeks.
I’m very high functional on the outside, to the point where my therapist says I have developed schizoid traits only from running away from all the bs I’m feeling inside. 


It started in the beginning of June when I felt myself tweaking and all of a sudden my brain got washed over with absolutely all amounts of adrenaline or dopamine or whatever and had the worst panic attack of my life I thought I was having a seizure. I went to the emergency room feeling like my brain was assaulting me with lots of adrenaline like it felt like I was on fire it was so much and my lips even turned completely pale. Ever since I’ve been tweaking like a motherfucker on speed.
I just turned myself in for the first time because whatever the fuck is going on isn’t good or usual to me. I’m not feeling euphoric but I’ve been having a severely unusual level of energy and agitation for nearly two months now, which I’ve been thinking just has been severe anxiety. I’m very control seeking body conscious so this feeling has freaked me the fuck out. I feel warm and tingly in my head all the time, or like there’s water showering down my head or that my brain is on fire. In general severely high level of anxiety, derealisation, depersonalisation, twitching, literally tweaking and EXTREME irritation. I’m very energised and sometimes I wake up throwing a tantrum. My thoughts are racing, I’m overanalysing ALL THE TIME and I always have new ideas over shit I’m obsessing over to the point where I get exhausted. I’m crippled in my room by anxiety. Way more emotional lability. Ex. Started self-harming just because I was feeling nauseous. Intrusive thoughts. I’m completely unable to rest or to sleep, I’ve been prescribed zopiclones to be able to sleep. I’ve been on vyvanse before for my adhd and it sorta feels like I am on that, just without the emotional regulation and the slight euphoria I usually feel from vyvanse. 

I’m fucking exhausted. I can’t fucking relax at all. I find myself screaming and crying sometimes and I even broke my phone during a tantrum. I have schizoid traits from complex trauma so I’m not used to this. 

My psychiatrist just gave me zyprexa, but I’ve had bad experiences with meds before and I’m too paranoid to try them. Fuck.",0,0

1584,oqxika,I think I might bipolar,"Disclaimer: Starting to realize I might have bipolar… will eventually bring this up to my doctor if I have the guts to since I ghosted the last appointment because the last time I saw him I was really sarcastic towards him since he sounded like an ass when I was updating him saying things like “ that’s why I’m here…lol… for u to help me??….” He was laughing and saying he never seen this side of me… I was half laughing too but I was actually annoyed by him :D

I had selective mutism in elementary school and In gr.7 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I was in and out of therapy/ medication till I was about either early 19 or 18… idek im turning 20 next month.

Between my doctor the word bipolar never came up. It was always just depression so that’s what I always ruled it out to be. 

When I read back on my journals, I noticed that I always say the sentences “ I want to hold on to this feeling before I get depressed again” and I describe it to be butterflies in my stomach, I’m productive asf, and I get so excited that I can’t even sleep. I literally pull all nighters when I get into this euphoric state of mind. I clean my whole room, I even fricken SANITIZE IT i deep clean it. I switch out my covers, clean my bookshelf, clean out my desk, shelves… I feel as though everything is turning out for the better. But then after I have a nightmare for a couple of days, I get depressed. Dedass why tf do I get depressed over nightmares that I barley remember?? I just feel so groggy. I also get depressed when I feel threatened by disrespect or disregard that I don’t matter. Ik I sound sensitive but whatever.

When I’m depressed I literally want to die. Unalive myself is always on my mind but I wouldn’t act upon it. It’s just literally the only think I can thing about when even the lightest thing goes out of my control. Like for ex… running out of eggs?? Ugh. I also get intrusive thoughts which… I’m pretty sure I don’t have to explain here. 

I didn’t realize it was a pattern until now when I’m turning 20.

I’ve done risky and on the spot things:

quit my job with no advanced notice 

“ghosted” my doctors and therapists, friends, people I knew

I literally bought a dog $1300+

I dyed my hair that cost around $290

spent $200 on makeup in one day

Spent $300 on online clothes also in one day….

got acrylic gel nails $80 that I diy removed them after a week (they usually last 1-3 months) because I got too angry  (I actually just took them off last night)

Idky I did that because I’m a broke person 

sexted (that shiet traumatized me :D  not because he leaked it, but because I was disgusted of myself I never thought I would do that. And now I can’t even look at my privates without feeling genuine disgust. He wasn’t even my boyfriend… just some guy online from tinder)

“dated”around

Lash extensions for again, no special occasion whatsoever
 
I’ve  spent a lot of money on food whenever I got pissed off. 

I also bought a gym membership in the beginning of 2019. I’ve never been to that gym Prior, and I never took the free trial. I just bought it and took the longest package they had which is 2 years. And NOW I never go to that gym. I go to the gym at a community centre… and even then, I don’t go regularly.

Most recently, I booked a tattoo appointment without thinking about it. Someone even told me they’re surprised I didn’t give it a week to think about, I just did it.  It’s not a small piece… I literally told the tattoo artist I wanted a huge back tattoo my budget is around 1.2k-1.3k+ mind you, I’ve never gotten a tattoo before and I also booked this when I was in my “happy” state of mind… :DDD 

Those are just the ones I remember from approx 2019-2021 ish

Some of these things I never told anyone I knew.  So yeah.

Even right now I feel calm and “normal”? Again… but right before this post I was actually sobbing and screaming into my pillow, biting my hands cause I was literally just done.

1585,ooyj4e,HELP - difficulty in transitions? Irritability?,"I have no idea if this is bipolar related but it sure got MUCH MUCH worse when I 'developed' bipolar in my 20's.

I have the HARDEST time with transitions, as in transitioning locations (or social situations to some extent) specifically. I'll be planning to go to my bf's house and I will be excited all day and have every intention of being bubbly and fun, but then for some reason moving locations/the transition of people just kills me sometimes. I already have a REALLY hard time with irritability ever since bipolar developed (worse in some moods than others but always there somewhat), and I can't even quite describe it but I just cannot deal with the transition and suddenly I become irritable super easily. This is not who I am, I hate it and am fully aware when I'm doing it, but I can't stop it for the life of me. I am just irritable in general but it gets worse in moments of transition. I am not mean, more cold and distant/uninterested. I have a harder time making those transitions some times more than others, and it fluctuates in severity. It is separate from hypersensitivity issues (mostly touch and visual for me) to some extent, although sometimes they will constructively interfere to a larger effect.

I feel like it's ruining my life even outside of the severe mania or depression I was used to (although I can't quite pinpoint my mood anymore and find it difficult to determine during an episode anyways). But I'm sleeping (5-6 hours, sometimes a bit more) and I'm not suicidal. I feel like there are two opposing forces fighting inside me and the devil usually wins.

And I DO NOT mean big life transitions. I mean walking 1 block to visit my boyfriend, things like that.",0,0
1586,onu6id,Going on a Cruise- Suggestions?,"Hello! 
Background: One of my more distant friends was confirmed with Bipolar Type 1 last year after a series of pretty high intense manic/bizarre episodes. In multiple episodes she’s mentioned to me and her husband that she thought I was going to kill/harm her (there’s not reasoning or logic behind that.) 

Last October, she was still adjusting to new medications , me along with a few friends spent the night at her house. I woke up to her about two feet from the couch staring at me blankly- I screamed and it really freaked me out, she had no explanation of why she was there.

Current: We booked a cruise over two years ago that has been rescheduled multiple times due to Covid. We will be sleeping in adjoining suite rooms on the ship, I’m slightly nervous about my safety just incase she has a manic episode in the middle of the night.  I also know in the past she’s had issues of not taking her medicine. 

How would you talk/discuss with a distant friend about your worries? The last thing I was to do is trigger her or make her feel isolated.

* I think about suicide 23 1/2 hours / 7 days a week, with half an hour of me being distracted by my cat
* I've been this way forever now because of early childhood trauma. I've never seen a reason for living and though I find stuff everyday, I have yet to find any good reason to keep me from killing myself in the eventually. All I have is my family cause goddamn if there is an afterlife I would spent eternity ashamed of myself for breaking their hearts, they've done so much for me I constantly self-loathe for being pessimistic, which ends up in an awful cycle of self-hatred. I do still consider doing it once they all pass away. 
* I stand by my argument that just as no one chooses to be born, no one should be forced to continue with their life. Suicide is every individuals' own decision and though it is really sad, no one should be frowned upon for choosing so. But I know absolutely no one would back me up on this, so it remains another one of my colder opinions. 
* Rapists should be castrated. You take someone's right to consent and, in some cases, their virginity,  I think your right to reproduce should be revoked. Ok, maybe not cut people's genitals off, but I think a lifetime of celibacy would be a fair punishment. 
* I have AD/HD as well as a panic disorder on top of bipolar and all my doctors seem to be constantly confused on how to help me. I feel like a child being moved around through so many doctors and having my family have to be on high alert on me all the time.  
* People seriously need to pussy up and stop getting so offended over swear words. 
* I once considered shooting up my school at least to the point of planning the attack. 
* Even if I go to jail, I really would like to kill someone one day. 
* I romanticize death and terrorism. And I know it's awful, but my trauma makes me so hyper-stimulated about the idea of dying and bringing your loved ones with you instantly. 
* I'm enby in a Spanish-speaking country and I'm mentally screaming any time someone misuses my pronouns, but I don't feel comfortable coming out yet. 
* Death penalty is necessary for extreme cases.

1608,krcd16,Looking for Writers who Want to Embarrass Themselves!,"Hello all,

My name is Ethan Fisher-Perez, I'm a first-year Neuroscience student in college, and I am trying to get a multi-platform mental health service called Above Cognition off the ground.

On my website, I plan to host the experiences of people with various mental health issues, which is why I've come looking for writers. If you've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and have a keen interest in writing about your experiences to help others, please let me know!

Writing about yourself can provide you with relief and understanding, and every post has the potential to help someone avoid what you've been through and provide them temporary and long-term relief.

This is a relatively small venture for now, but I don't plan on stopping any time soon. If you're interested in being part of something I believe could be important for many and bolster your resume with an entrepreneurial venture, I'd love to hear from you.

My mother has bipolar, and while learning about her symptoms made it easier to empathize with her, there's one thing I still struggle with: logorrhea. It has led her to humiliate me by airing her dirty laundry with my father in front of my friends, and she's talked my ear out about things I had no business knowing (like abuse she went through, or things people said about me that made me deeply insecure and vulnerable) when I was a child. All in all, that symptom hurt me more than any other aspect of the disorder. Even when I was on the verge of a panic attack she WOULD NOT STOP. And a lot of the time, the things she says are crytpic and full of clichés (like repeating phrases such as ""you only live once"" again and again), like it's an automatic response. I thought learning about how it feels from the inside would help me empathize more and help me make my peace with it.

I said that this made me uncomfortable because I wanted to be able to share stuff with her without it potentially jeopardizing my medications, and she said she keeps her notes intentionally vague and won't share information thats not relevant.

So my grandfather (on my moms side) died a few weeks ago. My mom has 2 sisters. At the funeral, my eldest aunts back gave out and she started having a panic attack before the services started and I had my panic attack meds with me. My other aunt works in psychiatric hospitals (idr the job title she has) but she works with medications, so I offered it to her to judge the matter. She took half of one of my pills, and I felt like a hero because my aunt was able to calm down enough to go to the services and see off her late father.

I mentioned this to my therapist, just that I felt like a hero and it all worked out.

The next appointment she tells me she directly emailed my psychiatrist about the situation and my psychiatrist had questions for me. This lead to an argument where I tried to express how betrayed and hurt I was that she did this behind my back without telling me, and she refused to apologize at all.

I'm pretty sure this breaches her confidentiality agreement, right? I was not a danger to myself or others. 

This betrayal lead me into an emotional breakdown where I actually almost killed myself because I was so overwhelmed with how exhausting existing is, and I havent allowed myself to be alone for the last 48 hours because im scared.

1612,k41qft,"Hi friends, I need your inputs for a honest question. Is it possible to move away/separate from someone with bipolar without breaking their heart?","Here's the story. I moved into a new place in Feb. which overlooks a grand house. There's a pretty girl in that house and we somehow exchanged smiles. I had a very good feeling about, sort of infatuation I think. Then again, in due time I felt that the girl was so deeply loving me (with all the gestures, and signaling from widows etc).Her dad seemed concerned and uneasy about it.I was impressed although the scenario seemed desperate. I was blinded by the admiration towards me. Although, we never spoke or met we have  developed a connection. Then a couple of months back I realized that the girl is mute. So, that explained the signs and her dad's concern. I was mentally preparing to talk to her dad about a potential relationship. I believe in karma so, I just wanted to talk to her parents as my attempt and leave the rest to fate whatever the outcome(yeah.. Indian). Then one fine day(which was last week), she comes out of the house staring at me with zero expression.. no affection or care which she showed earlier. I was really confused by the mixed actions and it had to be something and my research brought me to the term bipolar. Now as I type, she still shows subtle signs like the lights on or off, windows open with the AC on (In India, these things happen with very protective parents). She's almost always looking for me. So, I'm really really confused. I wasn't prepared for it (I can't deny my own family either). I don't want to break a sensitive heart at any cost. Will a bipolar person forget love feelings soon (if I'm gone from here)  or will she keep on thinking that I might come back?  Should I behave such that I'm an arrogant brat and break her chain of feelings? Please advise me.",0,0

1615,jp309w,Sassy psychiatrist doesn't believe I'm bipolar.," I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at 13 years old, when I presented my first hypomania, and began an untreated cycle of extended periods of depression, and a splash or two of hypomanic episodes.

I've been going to therapy for the past two years, after 11 years or so without it, and I love my therapist. She's confirmed my bipolar diagnosis, with PTSD as well (tons and tons of emotional abuse), and recommended me to go to a psychiatrist, because despite all my efforts, my depression still got in the way too much.

The psychiatrist didn't, for a second, believe I was bipolar, she treated me as if I was delusional and just read it off the internet, and that I was really BPD, just because it's her specialty. I told her I had a horrible history with meds, and was really reluctanct to try them again, I had them trigger hypomania and depression before. She assured me I was worrying about nothing and prescribed me with Lexapro 15mg, I said fine, then she also prescribed me with exactly the same medication I told her I had problems with, big red flag. Later, I found out a friend of mine was also taking Lexapro, and that his psychiatrist prescribed him with almost half of what mine gave to me, which was the second big red flag.

After a month of feeling like a heroin addict, it finally kicked in and I felt ""normal"" for a couple of weeks until I got my first mania in two years, and now I'm going through our much beloved subsequent depression, and it's hard. I went to a revision and she kept treating me as if I was a confused teen that didn't want to accept my BPD diagnosis, she started to ask why I kept calling it mania. I told her I didn't want to take any more Lexapro because I was only getting weird side effects and back pains, and she refused to tell me how to get off it. She pushed me into taking pretty strong anti-psychotics for my insomnia (I can fall asleep just fine, I can't stay asleep for long, pretty difficult to treat) and told me I could take them daily, after I told her I had acute IBS and didn't want to take any more meds that would be hard on my body.

My psychologist was pissed, she told me to get away from there, told me she was sorry and that it was weird that she behaved like that. And insisted that I demanded instructions to get off my meds, which I did, and now that it's starting to wear off, I feel much more miserable than when I began, but at least I don't feel like a zombie anymore and in control of my life.

I honestly don't know how people switch through meds, to me it's much more easier to live with my emotional imbalances than to go through this mind ruining rollercoaster just because a psychiatrist feels like it.

Just overly anxious. Health anxiety. Panic attacks. GAD. A little OCD as well. I went through a really bad run in 2016. Since then, things were going really well. I was functioning normally. Well my dog died last March suddenly and that fucked me up. It took me almost 6 months to pull myself out of that rut. I started doing well again, and then c19 had to come on by, and with all my anxiety history and issues, I’ve been a off and on mess since March. I was coping okay, until July. I started having panic attacks weekly, then daily, then went into a complete spiral of anxiety and due to how bad my depression was affecting me, I become depressed. I seemed to pull myself out of it slowly, it was fucking hard. I was literally staying at my moms everyday for a month because I couldn’t be left alone due to how bad my anxiety was. I had/have a major fear of fainting. Anyway, like I said I slowly was coming out of it. I forced myself to stay home one day, and I did it! And I stayed home. I felt like I was becoming more productive again, still having panic attacks off and on but I could handle them. Only issue I still had/have is bad insomnia every night. I started laughing again. Smiling more. Joking with my husband and having sex with him again. I felt like “I made it through it, I fucking did it”.. then, a few days ago out of nowhere I woke up feeling off. Ever since Friday I’ve been feeling way more anxious again. Basically how I felt at the beginning of my last anxiety break down. I’ve been assessed by many professionals btw. Anyway, i did something stupid and googled and somehow came across bipolar disorder and now I’m obsessed with worrying I have it. Today I was having such intrusive thoughts this morning, I kept saying what if I open the door and jump out of this moving car? What if I like lose my mind and I can’t control it and I just do it? I’ve had intrusive thoughts before but these were so scary.. I don’t know if I’m in the right place and yes I’m aware nobody can diagnose me on here.

1621,j46wxj,I spent over $3k on stuff over the past couple weeks and idk if it’s mania or not,"So I’m a big gun guy, and I’ve had this project I’ve been working on for a little over a year just laying in my closet being neglected. So after getting ripped off and realizing buying the other tools needed to do this project myself would cost the same as getting it professionally done I decided to ditch the sunk cost fallacy and pay for that. In total it’s gonna cost about $700 to get it taken care of. 
Next my anniversary is coming up and I wanted to get something that said ‘I’m sorry I buy lots of guns, please don’t leave me’. So I had my heart set on a pair of diamond earrings for her. After some looking around, I found I nice set of classic styled lab grown ones for $300. Probably overbought, but we are getting married next year, so why not. 
Today, I bought $1k in ammo online. Like the rest of the world, the gun community is on fire. It’s a mix of an election season, COVID, and the riots that’s causing the issues, but suffice it to say that everyone is buying everything, even if it’s price gouged. That being said, I have a site that I go to for most of my gun stuff and they had bulk packs of rifle ammo for pre-order. After checking around and coming to the conclusion that the price was probably not gonna drop, I bought it and a case of larger rifle ammo as well. The good news is that they have a 4 payment program for their stuff, which is awesome!

Not the point. As a social worker just getting by, I'm just taking different extremes & lumping them together for the sake of a discussion.

Would you rather have it all financially, be totally set & comfortable for life, a chef, a hot tub, a moat, whatever your vision of material wealth is, but be naturally stable while also being a shitty human being...or would you rather just get by (taking manic spending sprees & depressive buys into account), feeling wonderful sometimes & feeling like you want to kill yourself others, but be an inherently good person that has bipolar disorder & suffers from it.

To be honest, I wrote this with the intention of saying I'd rather be a bad person that's financially comfortable. As I've written this out, I've had a change of heart. I suffer. I want to kill myself often (shout out to my dog, Dodger, for keeping me here). Or sometimes my cycling fucks me up so bad, I don't feel like I'm standing on solid ground.

But there's a homeless man always standing on my exit with a sign, ""your donation would be a blessing."" I've never given him any money, my bipolar-related spends have made it so I'm just getting by. But everyday I get off that exit with my dog buckled into my passenger seat & I stop quickly to say hi & how are you. He sees my dog, he smiles & says ""there he is!"" Maybe he's an alcoholic & I should judge him, ""get a job, bum!"" Maybe he's a drug addict & I should scold him (because I'm so put together myself). Or maybe he's a Veteran that's been given the run around, as many are. Maybe he's just a nice guy that's having a hard time. Or maybe he's an alcoholic or a drug addict, a human being that has become dependent on a substance to live & is just trying to sustain the only life he knows. Regardless of the answer, I hope my dog's happy face makes his mornings. But I do digress.

I think I'd rather be a good, hard off person with bipolar than a wealthy, ""typical"" person without. In a way, writing this out gave me a little more self-love. I suppose I could do without a hot tub if it meant losing what makes me, me.",0,0

I don't mean to downplay regular depression, as it can also be severe enough to make someone feel suicidal, but Bipolar depression is a whole other ballgame.  It's frustrating when people assume it's the same as ""plain"" depression.  With regular depression you can fake your way through to some degree, try to use positive thinking, muddle through, fake it till you make it, etc.  With Bipolar depression that doesn't work. 
How would you describe the sensation/experience of Bipolar depression?  I'm curious if others can relate.
To me, it's like I have a severe flu.  My muscles don't work, joints ache, I can't think clearly and have such fatigue that moving from one room to another feels like I'm going to collapse into a puddle of exhausted tears.  All you can really do is cry and sleep.  Being conscious is hell.  It feels like you've been buried 6 feet under and you're all consumed by blackness.  It's like your existence is akin to wading through tar.  There's a black cloud that won't ever lift.  It feels like it will always be this way and won't ever get better.  There's no hope or end in sight.  The emotional feeling of all encompassing sadness feels like your soul is literally in hell.

BACKGROUND: So I was diagnosed with OCD at 12, have been on over 12 SSRI’s and SNRI’s, and had a six month stint in the hospital for anorexia.
I just went to another psychiatrist today who said he thinks I might have bipolar ii. 
Here’s the thing, though - my hypomanic episodes are definitely on the lesser scale, not flow blown mania. Also, I can sleep during these episodes. 
Mostly, I just feel like my moods are all over the place, but daily. Like intense swings for no reason, every day. Every night though, I always go back to the anxiety/depression. 
So I guess I just don’t understand.

1667,fd33oh,"Ive been diagnosed after 20 years of suffering, everyone's happy for me because know we ""know how to treat the mental pain"", but we don't and their optimism frustrates the hell out of me.","Saying that 50% of bipolar patients go into remission without having to waste their free time (let's be honest, after work and chores, every hour counts) on counciling constantly would be optimistic. 50% remission (even forgetting counciling) is a high number, but much lower than you, myself and thousands of other people deserve.



What's more, I already have issues with energy and there are only two non-sedating meds available to me (meaning, they will do lots of harm) taking them would replace one issue with another.

So realistically, the odds that I'll no longer have to deal with a severe mental illness or mild to moderate one (or, be put in remission) and not have to suffer (and yes, I know that a large portion of people suffer LESS) is quite low.

Am I missing something. Why is everyone around me so optimistic? Even if I'm lucky and beat the odds and go into remission, itll likely take awhile to get there, which means even more suffering. What's more, I barely have any fun time. Throwing in an hour or two of counciling a week will make my life even more void of free time. And that's that best I can hope for. Assuming I beat odds stacked against me.

I dont want to be part of the majority and have a reduction in symptoms. That just means I'll be living with a mental illness my whole life that's less severe. So what? What's so glamorous about living with an emotional disorder that isnt so life-ruining that it isnt considered severe?

Am I not allowed to feel that? Fuck ""training"" myself to be optimistic in the words of my mother, who called recently. Fuck the people who get mad at me for going with the odds and being aware that I'll most likely never be in remission and will continue to suffer and fuck bipolar.

I'm failing to see the point of trying to get better now and suffering while doing so.

Everything about him is perfect that ai can't even see a slightest imperfections about him. 

The thing is that, His ex-gf left him back in highschool because he has a bipolar and hasn't taken medications back in the day when he find out. I think she's around 17 years old and he's 18 years old when they started dating. She remarks that he uses his mental illness to manipulate her and to force to have sex with her.

She left him and started to spread rumors around the campus that only him and her knows about his mental illness 'cause of his image and his parents job. She told her family and friends and even ""his"" friends about that.

The thing is, she's not the only victim. He's the victim aswell 'cause his feelings was out of control. Having bipolar is serious that you can even having a mental phase and depressive phase without any reasons. What he needs is a help, guide, and understanding partner from her. 

The funny thing is, until now she keeps posting about shady stuff about him about ""having mental illness doesn't have the right for you to behave like that"". I can't understand the reason why would she post that on public. If she still angry and bitter about him, then atleast she could've talk to my boyfriend or to her circle of friends not ruining someone's life who is mentally stable right now.

But what I'm really glad about it her leaving him? Is i get to met my Boyfriend and guide him. He's taking medication right now and is completely opposite the one that his ex-gf talked about.

1672,f056vm,Does this sound like bipolar to you? Please help.,"Hello everyone, the last two years have been the absolute worst years of my life. My overall mental has declined. What does this sound like to you? 

•One major panic attack in 2017 triggered this decline in my mental health. I had a very bad drug experience smoking weed and had to be admitted to the hospital because I thought I was dying. 

•Constant fear that what I smoked was laced. Fear that the weed did permanent brain damage to me. 

•My overall mood is up and down. I tend to become very angry at my mother and father and last out at them.

•After having a good day (like going out with friends or a small trip) the next day is hell for me because of the sadness. I usually cry after having a good time. 

•Complete lack of motivation. I am an artist and now I rarely feel like working on any projects. At my job I feel like making through each shift is a challenge. 

•Was consumes for months (if not a full year) that I am schizophrenic. My doctor told me that I was not...but I couldn’t rationalize this in my brain. 

•Rarely spend my money because I fear that this shows that I am irresponsible and possibly manic/bipolar. Because I read that excessive spending is a sign of bipolar. 

•Constant scary existential thoughts about the nature of being a human. Almost as if I am scared to exist. 

•Feeling frequently disconnected from my life as if I am going through the motions 

• Constantly questioning my sexuality. Grew up in a very conservative house hold. I think I am gay but believe I will never be able to fully accept this aspect of my life. 

•sometimes sudden I treat in sex. 

•Sex is such a bizarre topic for me. Feel as if I want to have sex but feel that I am not attractive enough for it. Feel as if I am to disgusting for it. 

•Needing constant validation from others. I am convinced that I am ugly and overweight. When I look in the mirror I just think how disgusting I am. 

•Fear of being  narcissistic and or psychotic. Although everyone around me says that I am not...I can’t believe this. 

•Sometimes when I go out into public I feel like everyone is judging me and thinking that I am ugly, weird, and for some reason poor. 

•Think that most people hate me and do not enjoy my company

I've  been so depressed lately, I just can't do ... anything. It's a handicap, I spend days sleeping, doing NOTHING. As a  recreational and very ponctual user of cocaine, I tried two weeks ago to snort a little line before doing my vacuuming and laundry... and it worked out great !  Then I had this difficult day at work, I knew I had to work fast and  efficiently, so I went to the toilet to snort a little line, and OMG,  what a productive day I've had at work !

I am being treated for bipolar (Lamictal, Amisulpride and  Analfraline) but it's mostly my crippling depression that makes me  unable to do the little things. Now it's been 10 days since I've started  snorting a little line here and there to push me to do the little  things that seem impossible. The quantity I do are so little, I don't  have ""hangovers"" nor do I feel high. It's just a stimulant. Actually,  I've reduced my xanax drastically, because I feel energetic and  motivated so I don't have as much anxiety as I used to. I feel so good being right on schedule and being able to finish my day-to-day to-do lists.

I am going to talk  about this with my psychiatrist, of course ! But I just wanted to know  if anyone had a similar experience and if I could replace this shitty  illicit drug cut with baby powder and all kinds of toxic substances with a prescribed clean equivalent. I feel so fulfilled  when I'm able to do things, it really makes my depression better. I feel great, I am productive at work and with my personal stuff. It's such a huge change ! I realize it is SO BAD for my health (+ the mix with my medicine) but this is exactly what I needed all along !

What would you guys recommend (as a prescribed ""normal"" drug) that could give the same stimulation, energy and little euphoria (at least good mood)  that cocaine induces ? For 1) cocaine is expensive, and I can't keep going like this money-wise and 2) I don't want to end up an addict on a shitty street drug. I'm a good, normal person, with a very normal job.

Her dad/my ex is bipolar 2, I’m bipolar 1, and my current boyfriend is bipolar 1. So I’m not sure if she’s just going through normal puberty things (she had her first lady cycle about 10 months ago and is positively racing through all the physical parts of puberty) or if she’s starting to show signs of bipolar. I’m surrounded by bipolar, so I guess that’s all I’m seeing, not to mention that my own developmental years weren’t “normal,” they were bipolar years, so I don’t think I would recognize normal anyway. 

She’s in therapy for anxiety and her temper, as well as just handling her dad and I splitting - it happened 5 years ago and she still talks about it as if it is extremely painful, even in the moment, so I figured therapy was in order. She loves her therapist, but the therapist is unwilling to diagnose her with anything past “general anxiety” bc of her age. 

I’m just not sure if I should take her to a psychiatrist and have her evaluated. Should I? Or should I wait and see if things even out over this school year, maybe? 

I don’t know if I’m fully on board with the idea of medicating her already, but if she is showing signs of bipolar, I would definitely like the therapist to be teaching her more applicable coping mechanisms, maybe get her one of those mood tracking apps, something like that. I have one of those bipolar workbooks we could work through together, that would be good for both of us.

I feel like I am behind the wheel of a car I can only steer and it is accelerating. I tell myself that as long as I learn to steer, this entire thing will work out.

1688,d16n0w,I think 2 of my roommates have bipolar,"So during early July, one of my roommates (who was previously a hard partier) became a man of god. Normal right? But he didn’t seem like himself, and would CONSTANTLY talk about his, frankly insane, business ideas and was just generally really really weird. A week later he was in the hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar 1. Us roommates were there for him, giving him support, etc. Now he’s stable and on 1500 mg meds, seems like he’s back to normal.

So say that was roommate 1. Now another roommate, “roommate 2” is doing the exact same shit. He had a conversation with me about how he believes he’s the reincarnation of MLK. He wants to start a religion. He wants to become president. These are all apart of his business idea, in which he wants everyone to become vegan to save the world. Me and my other roommates are pretty bewildered by this situation. We’re scared honestly. But I know that this stuff happens naturally, and all we can really do is be there for them and help them. We’ve contacted roommate 2’s dad to give him the jist of the situation, as we did with roommate 1.

I’m not sure what I expect as a response to this post, but I hope that someone out there who has gone through this can give me and my roommates some advice or support for our situation. From our eyes it’s a complete coincidence that 2 of our roommates in our house have become manic within a month of each other, but in reality that has nothing to do with the situation.

A typical prescription for bipolar disorder might be written as 900 mg of lithium per day but that’s 900 mg of lithium-carbonate (not 900 mg of lithium), it actually contains 170 mg of lithium attached to 730 mg of carbonate.

So 40mg of lithium is still 25% of a bipolar dose.

1704,bq5w2p,I think I'm hypo but..,"I can go into mania if I smoke some weed (I smoke everyday for chronic pain and bipolar and recreation) and if I smoke a lot I go into the beginning of a psychotic break. 

Okay some back story before i went in the hospital I was obsessively trying to train my dog. The day I started blacking out and my mom took me to the hospital I had been up all night running around with my dog trying to make her aware of everything and to systematically check everything so that I would always have someone looking out for me (I was also training her to be a service dog). I was doing that type of training for a month or something idk how long I was manic.

And guys guess fucking what!! It actually fucking worked!!! 

Okay so the hospital was at the end of November and since then my dog does some communication like she lets me know if she's uncomfortable and I need to help her and she hasn't really had to help me yet but school is ending and I'm going to see my bf less and I'm going to start working again and there's just quite a few things changing. A week or two ago I started having some problems grasping reality, I would sometimes feel like this is all a dream and everyone was fake and at any second I was going to wake up and lose everyone. I thought it was being triggered by my period but that ended two days ago and now I'm hypomanic. 

Two days ago I smoked a lot which I normally do at night and my dog came in and was doing some things I taught her. She loves chasing the ball so I taught her to communicate by bopping the ball with her nose. I can't really explain what she did exactly to make me take her to my bathroom (my bf was sleeping in my room and he doesn't need to see me talking to my dog) anyway I took her to the bathroom (I had the ball) and I asked if something was wrong and she got excited like finally bitch you figured it out and tapped the ball then I asked if she was okay and she did nothing and then I asked if I was okay and she tapped the ball then I pointed to my head (I was technically pointing to my eyes and I found out after that my pupils were very dilated which also happened during the hospital) and she tapped the ball I pointed to my nose and mouth (I was supposed to point to my body but i forgot like most of her training) and she did nothing and then I asked if it was an emergency, she tapped the ball and then everything got fuzzy and really weird.  Like I felt fuzzy and it felt like there was static everywhere and things got a shade whiter. I went back in my room and realized I missed two doses of meds (I don't think that was the reason because I still took half a dose the first day and I took the full dose that night) and I started panicking and shaking and my bf calmed me down after awhile and I told him what Amidala did and apparently he believed me. 

Now yesterday, I did the same thing because I'm a dumbass who likes weed a little too much I also may have been trying to get a good video but that's beside the point. We were going to the dog park and I started freaking out and started crying and the dogs had been doing all the little signs I taught them to do to check in with me and then when I started freaking out they started freaking out really really bad and I was trying to remember what I was supposed to do but Amidala just kept looking and looking for something but I couldn't figure it out and it caused a meltdown. I was finally able to calm down and Amidala even told me I had mascara running down my face. We went to the park and they were still doing the little signals and checking everything and Amidala wouldn't drop the ball and she kept going over to the water without drinking and she was trying to tell me there was no water in one of the bowls. Also it had felt like we had just got there and we had been there for an hour. Also my bf doesn't really believe me on this one he just thinks they were freaking out because of the dog park, it scared him though and I feel bad.

I'm so fucking excited that all the shit I did wasn't for nothing like I actually fucking did it, it's going to take a minute to figure everything out again but I just needed to share the fact that I fucking taught my dog to warn me about psychotic breaks (honestly idk if that's what it is but that's what happened with the hospital and I think the reason I'm not blacking out is because I'm eating sleeping and hydrating -barely but still-) I'm so insanely shocked you have no idea, this whole time I thought that was all for nothing I ran myself into a psychosis teaching them and I thought it was for nothing but it fucking worked. I TAUGHT MY DOG TO FUCKING SAVE MY LIFE how fucking insane is that!!!!!!!!

I'm going to have my friend who knows dogs more than my bf to watch me get really high and see what happens I also think I want to go to my psychiatrist and tell him I'm going to come in super high so I can be observed by a professional, I want Amidala to be observed not necessarily me but I need my friend to do it first just to make absolute sure I'm not insane.

Sidenote that has nothing to do with my post but I'm also very excited that I'm manic this shit is so fun I feel amazing and I'm loosing weight, probably because I'm eating less. Also I'm going shopping later and the timing is so perfect 😂 I'm gonna have to have my friend take my wallet 😂😂

1705,bj1w9s,"When I found out how much I would be paid monthly if I get disability, I would still need to work one or two jobs. How fucking ridiculous. Reassure me that I can work again.","So, I was forced to leave my job in February of this year due to me having a complete mental breakdown followed by massive panic attacks, which prefaced the massive manic episode - all caught on camera. My boss watched the entire thing from start to finish. She deemed me a dangerous liability. 

I’ve been going to school during that time and it’s honestly hard for me to even get to class twice a week, but I’m trying my best because I missed the drop date and this is my **last** chance to pass this class. I hate the mixed episode I’m in.

My psychiatrist doesn’t want me to go back to work because he doesn’t think I can handle school and working again. He might be right. It could end up very badly, but I don’t have much of a choice. I can’t live in on what would have been less than a biweekly check allotted for the the month. I’m so stressed out trying to find a job because I’m scared Of how it’s going to effect my bipolar disorder with that big of a change. I’m scared I’ll turn into Eeyore for a month or six and just be a shitty employee. I’m even more scared of how batshit crazy I look during my manic episodes. And I’ve been rapid cycling on and off for at least 5 years, so everything’s possible. 

This time, I want it to be different. I don’t want my customers knowing that I have mental Illnesses. I don’t want my coworkers to believe that I’m crazy. 

I’ve been applying to jobs that I feel like I would like to do and where I can eventually bring my service dog in training after he does more training with myself and a professional. And I need to save up for this because it’s super expensive. The shitty part of that though is that I have minimal experience outside of the kitchen and I don’t think I could work in a kitchen again. 

Second problem I face is drug testing. I use prescribed doses of medical marijuana to substitute for Xanax. I wanted to work at Amazon but when I told them that I had a medical marijuana script that helps mitigate my disability, they said they use federal laws. It really hurt my soul because I felt like, one - it’s legal to use recreationally now and two - if people use it as a medication, it shouldn’t be discriminated against. There’s so many disabilities that have found it useful and it makes me feel like they **do** discriminate against people with disabilities. To discriminate against a treatment is ridiculous to me.",0,0

But exactly one weekend ago when the weather drastically got warmer, something changed and I haven't felt the same since. 

I feel like my heart is aflutter, to the point where I can't focus on the work I need to be doing. But I also feel REALLY alive, and I've become obsessed with a comic I found, like SUPER obsessed (which doesn't usually happen). I'm also very surprisingly horny, but I don't want my SO to touch me. Just myself (that's been the case for a while, as I'm sex-repulsed). Furthermore, I can't help but have these thoughts that I want to break up with my SO and move far away by myself. I've had these thoughts for a long time, but the urge to act on them has never been this strong. I know it's irrational, not wise for many reasons, and quite a mean thing to do.

I could only describe this feeling as Spring Fever, but I did a little Googling, and I'm afraid I might be having a hypomanic episode. I've never had any mental issues at all. I HAVE been working 18 hours a day every day since last October at a dream job that I love and have been giving my all to. And I did read that not going out much during winter may cause something like this state. 

Anyhow, does this mean I have been bipolar? What do I do? And how long will this feeling last? I need it to go away so I can focus again on work.....

1714,as1ozj,How do you handle manic mistakes?,"Context: Met a childhood family friend that I had always liked growing up. I had just gotten back into the country after years and reached out to her regarding circumstances in her life and offering support if ever she needed. 
She then started to show up at my place and drag me out with her and kept making plans for us together, until things got more intimate. Her personality changed, she ghosted and left me without a word. I gave her space(4months, I had to calm my own emotions from the ghosting) and finally when I saw she wasn’t reaching out, I did. She pretended nothing ever happened. 

I was confused but took it as rejection, it never really mattered if we didn’t get together, but she was someone I cared for and didn’t want to lose in my life.(logistically because I am supposed to move country mid year, I figured it wouldn’t work anyway but I was willing to give it a shot, to try at least. If it didn’t work out, staying friends was never a bad alternative.)
I only started to understand her condition(I’m a doctor) when I saw more of the signs and saw through the lies, narcissism, manipulation and gaslighting (both from her and her mother, who I guess wanted us to be together). I stayed by her for two more years hoping she would make amends on her own accord and helping her in the background as much as I could with the events happening in her life and the huuuge mistakes she was making during hypomania. It is so frustrating when I have to see her in person and she tries to talk to me like we are best of friends, is affectionate and acts like nothing happened between us. It’s so insulting and hurts. 
I wrote to her as gently as possible to try to get her to acknowledge at the very least what happened between us but only got silence. I understand that ghosting is an easier way to deal with things but would you do it to someone you grew up and have so much history with?

Then for a second I was like why do I need medication? Immediatly I was like no! Something is diffinatly wrong. I am glad I caught myself with insight before things went real bad.

I googled what to do when having hypomania. One of the results was meditation but to not try it during an episode if I hadn't before. Basicly saved myself from what ever would have happened because I have a daily meditation practice.

I started logging my moods in a mood chart app, which honestly I didn't want to do because I was hypo. I did it and I could do remembering back from Tuesday to Thursday.

So, here is the facts:

&#x200B;

I'm in 8th grade finishing off my last year of Jr High, and I noticed that I have been having a lot of ups and downs for more than I can actually remember. I always knew I'd have some on and off days, but I never really realized how extreme they really were until the other day. I was bored and I decided to watch a video about mental illnesses cause I had nothing else to do. So after it I decided to just go on the internet and take some of those self assessment tests for mental illnesses. I found one website that had a bunch, so I took them for almost every mental illness it seemed, and I noticed I scored pretty low in everything, except I got a moderate possibility of having depression, and very high possibilities of being bipolar and borderline. As I was curious, I decided to look for more of them on the internet and I scored pretty high in around every bipolar test I took. From doing some self reflection, I have realized that I don't gain much interest in anything. I am mainly focused on song writing, playing the guitar, and working towards being something in the rock industry, but I still sometimes seem to have little interest in that. I started getting into Nirvana a lot more recently, and heard about him having a bipolar disorder and doing drugs to try coping with them. I haven't taken anything yet, but a while back I was going pretty insane at a point in my life where I was practically yelling at myself, and my thought was to get on something to try clearing my mind off of most my general mental problems, and I haven't done anything, but I did pay for LSD through a friend of mine, trying to get something from one of her plugs. 

&#x200B;

\*But as I said, I have not received anything yet, and I wish not to get any comments on anything about doing drugs or such. I've already done a fair amount of research into that stuff\*

&#x200B;

I also noticed that I would usually be angry or frustrated for days at a time, and then would have a 1-2 day period where I would have a good time causing trouble with my friends. I've noticed I'd have problems with keeping relationships stable and okay. I have this really close friend-who we do have feelings for each other but decided not to date yet since she doesn't want to get into dating until she is at least 16-and I have told her about the mental illness assessments and me having thoughts of using drugs and that such, but she doesn't like me mentioning my problems for doing drugs. I've had some conflict with a friend of hers, which has a long backstory in of it's self, and I do get kinda pissed off and I can't really think straight or clear when I see them hang out together, or if she chooses her over me. I just start thinking about a different think every second when that happens, and I can't really clear my mind from it. She is always so caring and really great when I am with her though, and she usually always makes me happy when I am with her, but there are times when I just feel too angry about her or about nothing at all, and I just avoid any interaction with her at all, so I will just hang out with my group of friends instead. She has also asked me if I have suicidal thoughts, and I have told her that I never have, however I do find myself thinking about suicide around once every other month. Not really about it being better for anyone or that it would make me feel better or anything, but mainly about how it would go, what words I would leave behind on a suicide letter, and what it would be like for everyone afterwards. Nothing really too serious though.

&#x200B;

So, in a shorter version:

\- I lose interest in things quickly, find generally little interest in everything I do, no matter if I like it or not, and I find myself bored almost all of the time

\- I tend to cause problems in relationships, even my best ones, and I find myself usually being a problem

\- I usually want to be alone all the time, but when I do spend a good time with someone, I am happy, but I will still want to be alone

\- I get mad over very little things, and will generally be angry for no reason at all

\- I find myself having about week duration of extreme depression, followed by 1-2 days of feeling not as crappy

\- I have suicidal thoughts, but not very often

\- I have sleep problems where I can’t get to sleep until around midnight, sometime I wake up in the middle of the night. I’ll wake up tired right in the morning, but then not really realise I got little to no sleep, and don’t feel fatigued at all

&#x200B;

So, I really would like thoughts on what I have. Personally, I think I just have a bipolar disorder, BDP, and depression. However, maybe it is something different, and if anyone has any opinions, I'd be really thankful to hear them. Thanks!

P.S. - Also found out about the app Daylio from this sub, so I will be starting it from January 1st onward, and I may post updates about that if it may show anything usual to judge more on what I may be dealing with",0,0
1729,a7pboy,I might be bipolar,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here. I am a 25 year old female and English is my second language. 

For many years, I felt worthless, hopeless and depressed. In middle school I was often sent to psychologists and counselors by my teachers, as my mother refused to acknowledge there was something wrong with me, even going as far as calling me a ""sick rat"". I come from a single parent family, and only too late have I realized I suffer from ""daddy isues"" which lead me to make many many mistakes. With time, I got over that. 

My teachers saw there was something wrong with me and probably had the best intentions when they sent me to counselors. I was too afraid to speak the truth, so I would always tell them that the bullying was getting to me. I never told anyone how I actually feel and what makes me feel this way. It all came from home. My mother had several partners, and I hated them all. I sensed the evil in them. One of them touched me when I was little (it was nothing too severe so I kept quiet). The next one was just pure evil, he was very controlling and abusive. Watching my mother quietly take that filled me with sadness and hopelessness. It was the cause of my self diagnosed depression(later legitimately diagnosed as a depressive episode with no psychosis).I never told this to any professional at the time because I was afraid of my parents' retaliation. 

Years painfully dragged by, my sadness would come and go, but after a recent painful break up, something changed in me. I am more hopeless than ever, I cannot fall in love anymore, I have zero motivation and will to live. I am still afraid to go and see a professional. Last time I had to go (I needed papers to justify my 3 month absence from school), the doctor seemed to take what little I told him as a joke and I felt like I could not trust him, let alone open up to someone who seemed to have a condescending look on me and would not take me seriously. Fear was still there. 

I am easy to open up to strangers online, and through many conversations I learned what was wrong with me. Depression, daddy issues, lack of self confidence and self respect, strong suicidal tendencies. I read of these conditions online, and then I heard of bipolar syndrome. With all listed above, I think I might have this as well. When my cycle is somewhere half way and especially near its end, the symptoms only worsen. I become a toxic, self pitying, terrible person. Recently I noticed it was not only when its that time of the month. It happens on any day. Surges of happiness, inspiration, motivation, followed by dark thoughts, sadness and self pity, feelings of worthlessness and the ever present wish for death. 

I know I am well over due to see a professional about this, but how can I get over my fear of opening up to them? I am afraid that I am so far gone that I will need medication, and I do not want that. Im afraid of side effects and stigma. I wish to get better, but I am afraid of what it will take to get there.",0,0

1735,9ug78a,Are there temporary alternatives to medication?,"I stopped taking medication about a year ago because I had two periods of school I needed to do.

I need to finish these courses and then I'm done school forever, I'll be certified in my field, I'll be able to start my own company and train my own employees.

I have less than a month left. I've been having little blips of what felt like the beginning of mania for the past month. But I'd wake up the next morning and feel fine again and be able to just continue on my merry way.

This morning I woke up feeling like I'd just been given a shot of adrenaline. I'm worried I'm stumbling into an episode, but I'm almost done! I can't be trying to find a med combo right now, I have exams to do and things to study and practicals to do. I think it might be daylight savings that did me in, that finally tipped my boat of stability. But holy moly could I not concentrate in class this morning. My legs were bouncing, pen was taping, I can barely read my notes they're all over the place.

Is there something other than medication I could try? Just for the next month. Does marijuana help? It's legal where I live so I could buy some at the store and try that?

She has been diagnosed as Bipolar type one. She has had this diagnosis for about a year now, it has been a bumpy ride.

She's consistent with the medications she takes, she is still working on finding the correct dosage. 
Last night, I asked her if she was in a place to have a heart to heart (she wasn't, I didn't know). I tried to ask about the fact that we only have sex about once a month. She freaked out. And I mean freaked out. Screaming at me that I don't love her ect. And not using any of the tools she has learned to pull herself out of this state. I kept trying to tell her that we should put this on pause so she can calm down. She escalated it even further, grabbing my arms, still screaming, and telling me I don't care about the life we've created together. Normally I would leave the room because we both need space when she goes through this. That was not an option. So long story short I reacted in a way that I'm not proud of and physically threatened her by getting in her face. She stopped. We talked it out. But how do you know when enough is enough?

A girl I've known for about 2 years know has suddenly cut me off completely after we\`ve been texting daily for the last 8\-10 weeks. During this time we\`ve met twice, gone out, talked alot, had lots of fun conversations and, considering everything, I really thought it was going rather well.

When we met in person for the first time alone after knowing each other and having on/off contact over the years, she was really open and we talked alot about her diagnoses, which she has only recently gotten (mid March). There had been multiple ocations were we were making plans do go out or have dinner together, but everytime something ""came up"" from her site, so that the date was canceled.

But I kept checking in with her, and we finally got to meet 2 weeks ago, had a great evening together walking around town and hanging out, talking. We were planning to meet again sometime last week, but once again, she cancelled. She told me she had to watch her sisters girl, and I didnt think anything of it. But since then, she has given me the silent treatmend.

Since she told me about her metal illness, I've been studying about bipolar in order to maybe be able to understand what she's going through, and I've come across alot of ""cases"" (for the lack of a better term), where bipolar partners or friends just shut down any communication for no obvious reason in order to be alone with their feelings they dont want to share or see as a burden for people around them.

While it would be difficult to just stop having contact after texting daily, I would, offcourse, give her the time and space she needs, although I'm not really sure if thats even the case right now, but she's constantly online texting on Whatsapp, even posting stuff on Instagram. My quenstion is: Is this normal behaviour or did she single me out? I really wouldnt know why and I'm very confussed. I tried reaching out to her twice via text, asking if she wants no contact or if I had done something wrong and if there's anything I can do to help. No answer.

Offcourse I dont claim to even remotely understand what it means to have bipolar, I just really like this girl, she's been my motivation to keep going after having a rough few months, and this situation is really getting the best of me right now.

She goes back and forth between posting videos of her dancing (badly I might add) and saying she’s trying to build her career as a dancer, and posting videos of her swearing about her mother and crying because she has no money to eat and no one will help her. There’s things like inspirational quotes and trying to do a fundraiser for charity between these posts of her weighing herself saying her weight loss isn’t from drugs it’s because no one will help her.

I felt absolutely terrible and messaged her and gave her $20 (all I could afford) but the behaviour has escalated, tonight she posted a video of herself dancing in her underwear asking people to PM her and pay if they want to see more.

This person) (who I'm trying to not mention by name or relationship to me for their privacy) has been suffering for years with crippling depression and anxiety and is currently perscribed antidepressants but it doesn't seem to help all of her symptoms and from what she says it's the only thing that somewhat works for her with the least side effects. 

Right now her environment is not very stable or healthy, because of a number of endless work, school, home and financial worries, as well as unavoidable conflicts with family members. On top of all that she has had more than a fair share of traumatic past events (which she had sought counseling about for several years but they didn't do much to help her cope with current issues). 
Despite this, her baseline personally is sweet, loving, an all around genuine and wonderful person to be around. But she has these ""shifts"" that can come about from the smallest trigger, where her personally changes completely and she becomes extremely angry, irrational, impulsive, and emotionally sensitive. In this phase it's like she's a different person and the anger consumes her to the point where she doesn't know what she wants and every word she says is typically something along the lines of her being worthless or undeserving of anything good in her life and that everything that does happen to her is something that she deserves because she's ""a bad person.""

At that point, there's no getting through at all and it usually lasts the entire day. I'm more or less her only support system and I have tried a number of approaches ranging from giving her space to work it out on her own, talking and assurance, and of course I've had a few regretful outbursts as well which I've learned to control because that's not helpful to her at all. If I go the talking route, we've lost entire days just trying to get her through an episode and that's not always possible when we have work and other things to do that day. 

At some point, she will simply return to her normal self, usually in the later evening. It's hardly even gradual but I can tell just by looking at her when she's shifting back. We can then talk rationally about things and she will apologize and I'll try not to dwell on talking about the episode for too long. At that point, she will also typically realize she overreacted or reacted based on expectation vs reality in a situation, which of course will drop her mood sightly, leaving her feeling that something is wrong with her. 

I care very deeply for her and truly want to help her more than anything. She wants help too but doesn't have many options at the moment and isn't convinced she's bipolar, but I believe she is and that her manic is anger instead of energy. But I don't know how to cope with it myself since we live together and I do care about her so my emotional attachment makes it difficult to be a support for her and deal keep myself from pacing anxiously like I am right now. She had an episode yesterday and is having one again today. I know she needs to seek some sort of professional treatment as soon as possible but if anybody can offer up some tips or methods or anything to help me and her I would greatly appreciate it.

We both went through some really intense stuff together like her getting a breast reduction and recovering from that as well as some drama with me and my long term best friend, throughout all of this we were strong and she told me she was in love with me and that she hadn't felt this way about anyone in a long time, she even made me bond with her family and we became really close.

Over Christmas she cried because she wouldn't be able to see me on the day and that I was the only one that she wanted to spend it with, so I pulled some strings and I made it happen for her, for us, silly me.

We spent a reasonable amount of time together over the holidays, around 15 days and there was no sign that we were going to break up or anything, in fact she told me that that would be the last thing she wanted and that she loves me and never wanted to lose me, she also stated that she feels like she was going to go through a manic phase and that she could always feel it coming, this was something I hadn't experienced before.

See the thing is I came back to my house (I live an hour away) and the next day she messaged me saying she thinks we need to talk, she broke up with me an hour later on the phone stating that she ""doesn't think we're compatible"" and ""that we'd highlighted some things about each other"" that she ""loves me but isn't in love with me"" and that she ""needs to focus on herself and doesn't know what the future holds or doesn't see it after her breast reduction"" i asked her to think about it for a week and come see me, she did that and came back down, returned all my things except a few and told me the same things, she was not acting like the girl I fell for at all and she told me that she wanted to kiss me the entire time she was there but then told me immediately that she didn't want to tell me that, she did cry however this is something she did constantly over nothing while we were together and ended laughing at how upset I was at one point, as far I'm aware she is medicated on 150mg of sertraline a day, I'm not sure if that has any effect.

Not only that but when she got home she blocked and deleted me off all social media and my phone number, I hadn't even pestered her or hurt her in any way, as far as I'm aware I treated her like gold, I loved her she was someone I never wanted to lose, I told her so many times her illness doesn't define her and that I would never judge or abandon her. But she just won't talk to me. 

My question here is am I just reading things on here that sound similar and making false associations or does this sound like something to do with her bi polar? Any advice or just general conversation would be much appreciated.",0,0

1768,7jajfy,My gf thinks I don't care what she has to say because I can't concentrate and lose interest quick.,"Bipolar 1 here. To start, I have issues with my executive functioning, meaning memory, concentration, etc, due to neurological damage from our lovely disease. Even when I'm stable, I am very poor at focusing, remembering, and most certainly splitting my attention and multitasking. Gf knows this very well. My attention span is wildly short...I often lose interest in an answer right after asking a question. So it's difficult to sit thru her long winded answers. 

She has been incredibly patient and id be lying if I say she's not understanding for the most part. I know I've got to get a hold on it because eventually she's going to start resenting me. I forget so much of what we talk about, what she says to me, or what happened. I can't multitask so if I'm focused on one thing, it doesn't matter if something else is going on in the room...my brain will not split attention effectively. 

Amongst the things she has become reasonably irritated at, she lately is especially bothered by the fact that I will ask questions that were just answered or evident from the conversation happening in the room. I live with her and her bf (we're poly), and so there's often a conversation going on where not all of us are involved. For some reason she expects me to be listening to all their conversations. 

Yesterday, she wanted to talk to me about it. She start crying saying she feels I don't think what she says is important because I don't listen. She's frustrated w/ the fact that I'll ask her a question, then tune out a few seconds after she begins answering or that my attention will fizzle out when I'm working on something and she starts talking to me. 

Kept telling her I understand why she would be frustrated, and that I myself am very frustrated with my concentration. Kept trying to explain that I lose attention with my own self! I'll get up to get something and lose track of the thought and forget why I got up! Or I'll have to read the same sentence 5x. 

I get that I'm probably extremely annoying for having to constantly ask her to repeat or answer questions I would've known had I remembered or been listening. I'm seriously trying to take steps to improve my concentration, especially since I know and accept now that I cannot at all multitask. But it's frustrating for me to have her understand I'm handicapped in this way, but then still hold the same expectations of me that she would someone without these problems. I tried giving her a solutions on many occasions (call my name or tap me to get my attention before just talking expecting me to automatically focus on you), but she doesn't really do it, or if she does, she still expects me to be listening when she doesn't first do it. 

So my questions are: 1) How can I effectively communicate that I need her to employ my solution so that we don't keep having this issue of unmet expectations; 2) for those who have cognitive issues, what are some strategies and tools I can use to be better...I would be very annoyed to have to deal with myself; 3) is there anything else I can do? Or a link I can show her?

Tldr; I have issues with concentration and memory due to BP, and while my girlfriend is very understanding and patient when it comes to memory, she really gets frustrated with me when it comes to concentration. She won't really take up my solution to this problem either, and holds me up to the same standard she has of other people who don't have cognitive issues. What do I do?",0,0

April 

He said he was going to Colorado to clear his mind I said great! he went to sleep with a woman he met at a work conference  they both flew to Colorado had a 3 day affair.
He broke up with me after...... saying he doesn't have these feeling for me that he doesn't love me. 
He feels horrible about what he did .
We got back together he was undiagnosed at this time, we thought it was the sex and love addiction. Maybe it was maybe not.

May 


We make up he says he's sorry still I can see something in his eyes just not right his eyes change when he does this to me his whole demeanor. He's sad then he's energetic he's a mess he sees that I'm hurting and he is just energetic not sympathetic.
We head to his family house at the end of May he said he stopped talking to this girl. He said  ""That was a huge mistake""

June 

He's a bit better we are taking trips to Utah and Colorado and Arizona it was great! 
one day while we were in the middle of our  trip he stops talking and gets super irritated we get into a argument one day the next two days he's back to normal he said he needed sleep and was hungry so Sure why not. 

July

We had a great time ! 
He tells me he might have a mood disorder his therapist tells him. He gets an appointment to see a Pdoc. We are waiting ....:


August

 Says he wants to work on his sex and love addiction and wants to be ""alone"" to work on himself. Lies !!! he went to see that girl again for the weekend flew over there . Calls me on Monday saying He's sorry and says he needs help that he loves me and he's scared of his addiction. I'm doing damage control He heads to a Buddhist retreat to clear his mind. He comes back more zen and peaceful he said he can feel emotions now.  
Since we finally waited for a month for this  enters the Pdoc she says you're depressed, prescribes him anti depressant LEXAPRO.
WRONG!
All hell breaks lose for two weeks he's an asshole irritable moody doesn't want to talk next thing you know he curled up in a ball in the corner fml talking about that I should just shoot him in the head. 

At the end of Aug we are headed to the a couples psychologist /therapist he gets off Lexapro and goes on Lamictal! 25mg and rises. 

Sept
 We are in couples therapy and it's great his Meds are working he says this is how I'm suppose to feel he says this is my moment of clarity, he's up to 50mg  he says I think I'm just going to tell my Pdoc to leave it at 50mg im like ok if it works for you it works for me.  Great month he's nice sympathetic just the nice man. I saw hope 

Oct
We are great in the beginning of the month toward the end his  job is getting stressful I tell him let meditate let's breath. It does  seems to work. Oct 29th happens he says he's going to do this by himself that he's been on bipolar pills for a month and doesn't have feelings for me , he says he wants to be alone to work on his recovery he doesn't see himself marrying me and having children packs my stuff into my car and I'm crushed so crushed  right away I think the Lamictal is not in therapeutic dose. He doesn't listen that same day he flies to see this girl I didn't know that till the middle of the week. Wtf! Is his problem he says he feels feeling for her, feeling he doesn't feel for me . Then he starts talking about conspiracy theories, how the Celebrities are into the sex scandal and how Hilary is covering it up. He's everywhere. His face his eyes everything is different. I take a pregnancy test I'm pregnant I'm sure that made him more manic he said how could you I don't see myself with you, your horrible kicks me out .He spoke to his Pdoc started raising up his dose of Lamictal to 100 and it's going to go up also gave him Xanax to calm his nerves. 

Nov

He is still up and manic tell me to abort the baby he doesn't want a child with me. I'm fucking losing it. He calmed a bit he still adamant he doesn't want me in his life. He's more worried about her and wants her in his life. He is going to spend time with her next week for his birthday. I'm so crushed. We had plans.

1776,6jzy1j,I have a strong feeling im bipolar,"I havent got my Bipolar condition diagnosed, ,I always have had cycles of motivation and loss of intrest where im convinced that the new found interest is the best thing in the world and thats what im going to do in my life.Eg- Vegan diet, spirituality, astronomy, stock market, sudden motivation to make money or close all them 100 tabs in chrome that i opened as part of my research without a second thought. I get very involved, its all im thinking about in that time and i make promises and commitments to people around me and end up disappointing them every time. And because of this behaviour I havn't excelled in anything in life, i have no talent that Im proud of myself, including any socialising skills. Now i'm just locked up in my room and stoned most part of the day. I'm very confused with life atm, like to go through life with no talents and being useless to society. Also Im very lazy so i keep thinking ill be stuck in this room my entire life while feeding off of my parents like a parasite.

1777,64twwq,I'm gonna do a dumb thing,"Met with my psych today because I want to get off lamictal. It's been really good for me but I don't like the idea of being on meds forever if I can help it. We're going to keep the seroquel in the evenings to make sure I'm getting enough sleep. This could be disasterous but I've addressed a lot of behaviors that were contributing to my poor mental state (particularly the intense self-criticism and loathing). I'm pretty confident I can manage without meds. If not, well I'll obviously go back on. I'm also seeing a therapist regularly now to help with monitoring. 

So that thing could be dumb, or fine. The really dumb thing is going to a festival of sorts for 5 days in a couple weeks. There will definitely be drugs which I will definitely be doing. Talked with my psych about this too. Basically said ""NO COCAINE"" and less is more with everything else. Favorite quote, ""downers preferably, like opiates. Oh god I can't believe I'm having this conversation"" lol I had a problem with opiates when I was younger so even if they were around I have no interest. Most likely will stick to minimal amounts of molly and not so minimal amounts of shrooms. And will still likely be doing cocaine... No alcohol or weed. 

Certainly not the best time to be going off meds. Really looking forward to the trip though! It'll be an incredibly comfortable environment, lots of love and cuddles. I have another appointment for the Monday I get back from the festival. Wish me luck? You can scold me too if it makes you feel better. ",0,0
1778,5tre3g,I think I might have bipolar,"So let me start by sharing a bit about myself.

I'm 19 and a few years ago once I had left school I spent 2 years locked inside my room distracting myself with the internet which now looking back at it made it worse. I grew very self conscious and became depressed and when it got really bad was these random moments where I'd feel suicidal. So that's about 2 years of depression and no one ever really noticed.. not even I did.

Skip to now I've started college and even though I've gained some weight I generally feel better about myself after talking with a therapist about my problems.

And now recently I've gotten into a relationship. It makes me feel so good about myself at times but I've recently realized how rapidly and uncontrollably I switch between happy and sad.

That's putting it lightly though.. 

I've always had this thing where little things could make me really upset.. like one small example is playing games with friends.. and they get frustrated with me.. which is fine it happens.. but when people leave me and play the game by themselves or just leave me in general I begin to burst out and get incredibly upset.. feeling horrible and almost start crying over this little thing.

And being in a relationship is really messes with me.

I was reading some posts that people made about Bipolar and I never realized that being paranoid could be also be from it.. which in that case is a big plus for me because I get paranoid like crazy..

On my bad days when I go outside I feel everyone is looking at me and talking about me.. when people laugh behind me I feel they're laughing at me. I feel people are judging me around every corner.

My paranoia is effecting my relationship too.. A few days ago my partner was offline and never said why. It led me to get paranoid thinking there was something wrong and when they came back they didn't talk to me much and gave very uninterested responses.. I started to panic and felt like I did something wrong and that quickly grew into believing maybe they're going to break up with me and leave me causing me to explode and tell myself my life is over.. 
Later on that day though they started talking to me again and things quickly went back to normal and I realized I went a little over the top.

This happens often.. and the smallest bit of something can set me off to freak out and think everything is over.. but I also get very happy at times.. Sometimes I feel super confident and on top of the world like everything in life is going my way. And sometimes I can feel both paranoid and on top of the world in the same day. Like in the morning I look at myself in the mirror and think I'm handsome and feeling good.. then when I return home feel horrible and say stuff like ""I looked like this all day? eww""

I don't like to do self diagnosed things because it makes it sound like I'm just trying to get attention but I really think I suffer from Bipolar..

I realized it may be the case when I was laying in bed thinking my world was over because my partner didn't talk to me enough or something.. I just stopped and thought ""Why am I so upset what if I'm just being paranoid? why am I being so paranoid and why do I feel like I want to die?"" and thought of Bipolar because I remember hearing its symptoms were extreme emotional reactions and stuff like that.. 

After looking it up I found I pretty much have everything Bipolar does and ofcourse I'm going to try and talk to someone professional before ever outright saying I suffer from it but I just wanted to talk to someone about it which led me here.. 

It honestly would explain a lot because I have always noticed I react very emotionally to the smallest things.. like my previous examples.. I always walk around the house slamming my head against the walls telling myself everything is over and I should just give up. Even from the smallest things

Edit: I just wanted to add that when I do get upset, I find I can't focus on anything and I've actually got a black page bookmarked on my browser because I feel better when I literally stare at a black screen.. I can't watch any videos because I get annoyed and can't focus.. I can't do anything but stare at a black screen and calm myself down",0,0

1785,59mlyr,Regarding Everyone's Least Favorite Word: Attitude,"**Your attitude --> Perceptions --> Mood --> Attitude**

That there is a feedback loop.  And there's one factor in there that is controllable, even if you're depressed.

I've always been able to stay high-functioning while depressed.  It's never interfered too significantly with my social life, academics, or work.  

That doesn't mean my depression isn't severe.  I've been suicidal by night, functional by day.  The depression is still there, waiting for me to pay it mind.  I've read a lot and drawn from personal experience, and I've come up with long winded explanations of how I think one can try to remain high-functioning while being depressed.  But I think it really just boils down to this.

What happens to you doesn't make you depressed.  It's how you perceive what's happening to you.  This is widely accepted in psychology and philosophy.  The chemical imbalance in your brain certainly affects those perceptions, but it's not the whole story.  We're not slaves to our brains.  We can change our perception and therefore our mood by resiliently controlling our attitude.  This creates a feedback loop, as demonstrated above

This may not be the complex answer you were looking for, but I find this to be an absolute, understated game changer.

I'm not saying those that aren't coping well have an attitude problem.  Well, I kind of am.  But what I really mean to say is we have to work that much harder to maintain a good attitude, and it's really our most empowering tool.  It's our way of denying the depression power over us.  It's our way of punching back, and the more you throw, the stronger you get.  The more you exercise this ability that we all have, the more depression loses its hold on you.  Even when it comes back, you know what to do and how to do it.

Don't just *be* in the fight that depression puts you in.  Don't just stand in the corner and let it pummel you.  Fight back.

Turns out this was another long winded explanation, but I hope this message was a little more succinct.

TL;DR:  Your attitudes forms your perceptions, which forms your mood, which forms your attitude.  Resilient people never lose their attitude, and that's why they cope better.",0,0

1787,5579tr,Bipolar Girlfriend Breaking up with me Over Misunderstanding,"I am a 29 year old male and I have been in a relationship with a 20 year old female for the last year and a half. I am the first person she has ever been in a relationship with.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think that she may be bipolar. I know for a fact that her aunt is and, as these things are genetic, there is a good chance that she is as well. She has constant mood swings. One minute she's happy and the next she's depressed. She hasn't told me that she is bipolar, but she knows that she has mood swings and she knows that these cause issues for her. She told me before that she was really grateful that I always stick by her through her mood swings.

Throughout the relationship, she has always got herself worked up over things that aren't problems. If she thinks something is wrong, she doesn't talk about it and she lets things build up in her head until it becomes an issue for her.

Examples from the past have been:

Her almost breaking up with me because she assumed that I couldn't cook, even though I can.

Her thinking I was cheating on her because I smiled when I sent a friend a message on Facebook.

Her thinking I was catfishing her because her friend stopped talking to her on Facebook as she walked into the room where I was using my laptop.

I could go on and on, but I think those three examples are enough to make my point. She has a tendency to be very snappy at times. If there's an issue, she won't communicate with me about it, but she expects me to be able to figure everything out and this can lead to arguments. Sometimes she will even try arguing with me while I am being calm and rational, refusing to argue back.

Despite this, we have never had a bad argument. We have never shouted at each other or made nasty comments to each other. Our arguments have been pretty normal, apart from the fact that the arguments could have been avoided if she had spoken to me beforehand. We don't even argue that often and from my perspective there wasn't a problem.

She is aware that most of the arguments are a result of her lack of communication or mood swings but, after not speaking for a few weeks due to her university commitments, she has decided that she wants to break up because we 'sometimes argue'. There wasn't a problem before we stopped talking and she was completely happy in the relationship.

She has given other reasons for the breakup, but they are also things that aren't worth breaking up over.

One of these is a complete misunderstanding as she assumed that I wanted to be a freelance cameraman when we moved to another country, where her family live. She knows that this line of work won't pay enough money there and she falsely assumed that I would not take any other kind of work. I am even working in an admin role now, which I have worked in in the past. I also tried to get a job in the country we were moving to and I was immediately successful, but she told me not to take a job there until next year due to a change of plans. Unfortunately she is worrying that I won't find work when I move.

Another issue for her is that she is worried that I am hiding something from her. She thinks this because, when I am doing something football-related, I don't talk about it with her in great length. This is because she has no interest in it and I don't want to bore her. Not because I am hiding something. In the past she has also convinced herself that I am secretly married with kids. This came out of nowhere and the idea only got into her head because she has heard about these things happening to other people. Things like this happen all the time, but I am used to it and it doesn't make me love her any less.

I know what she's like and what has happened here is she has spent weeks worrying over these things, along with other issues, without talking to me or anybody else about it.

I have tried telling her that we need to speak about this, but I can tell that she doesn't want to. I've explained to her that every couple argue sometimes and I have told her that I am looking for another admin role when we move and that my plan is not to be a freelance cameraman out there.

While it might sound like she has lost feelings, according to her family, she has been crying because she hasn't been speaking to me, while she told me herself that she cried at the thought of never seeing me again. She has also been looking through pictures of us a lot.

All she keeps saying to me is that she has made up her mind and she won't change it, but the reasons are definitely because we sometimes argue and she thinks that I won't take a permanent role when we move.

Obviously these things are not worth breaking up over, but what can I do to convince her of this?",0,0

1790,50qnxl,Does being bipolar mean you are incapable of being faithful?,"I know there are faithful bipolar people out there. 
But right now it seems I might be with one of the rare bipolars who aren't capable of being faithful.

My wife cheated on me in the past and planned many ""escapes"" and all night-ers and drinking binges in the past. 


And she did all this armed with nothing but a cellphone. She also had life changing talks on this cellphone with me and arguments with people on this cellphone with resulted in the destruction of a lot of her relationships/friendships.

She hasnt had a phone for the past 8 months and I was glad because her phone just seems to worsen her bipolar symptoms.

But...
She came home today with a brand new cell phone. Despite me telling her I did not want her to have one because of all the terrible things which occured when she had a cellphone in the past.

She insists that things will be different this time. She says she wont use her phone to flirt or cheat nor plan outings behind my back.

I have no idea if shes being truthful.

What advice do you all have for me?

1791,4zmnid,Pleaase help me understand my BPD ex girlfriend,"I met a girl about 3 yrs. ago, she was married for 18 yrs. with 2 teenagers. When I met her she was on very high sleeping and anxiety meds, she brought a lot of baggage with her, like family drama, divorce/kids issues but I accepted her and helped her unpack. Her family hated me and constantly tried to separate us thru different games. One day, she stepped out for bit and came back to find her kids gone w/their furniture and she had no clue. She calld me and I helped her day/night thru that crushing time and she moved in with me.
We started having our own issues like any couple, and during the 3 yrs she left me about 10 times. I would come home from work and she with her furniture would be gone. Than I would text her to find out what happened at that specific time and it ranged from our arguments to her family telling her stuff to leave me. However, next day she would move back in apologizing and crying. I started school which took most of my time and she would complain about it, I would ask her to watch TV, go out do something but she would just sit on the couch and not do anything unless I did it with her. One day out of the blue she tells me, she is going to mexico for a week bcz I was busy with school too much. I told her if she goes like that I don’t wanna be with her. She went anyways but next day I got 100 calls/texts with her crying saying help me, I have BPD, this is a manic attack and that’s when I first found out about it.
I forgave her, she came back, promised to go to a doctor and get it treated which she never did. About a month later I found a paper in the scanner and it was a rental agreement, so I confronted her and asked are you moving out, her answer “well, it is what it is” I told her you people are snakes, normal people don’t do this, how many times are you going to do this to me and left the house, she sent me many messages again explaining manic episodes and apologized and cried like hell. I forgave her again. About a week later she said needed help with money, I agreed and then one day I asked her if she can try another way to help us out and I got a really bad gut feeling on her text reply. Next day I went to school and got a text from her saying, this is toxic I am leaving in 2 days…
She looked normal when I got home, I accepted her decision, and 2 days later she took 3 yrs worth of pics, greeting cards etc threw right in the garbage and while moving out she was happy, laughing like she didn’t even know me. Never said any good byes to my family nothing at all, Just so happy that I couldn’t believe it. 
I didn’t know how to deal with it so I texted her after and w/o saying anything about BPD, I apologized for my mistakes in the relationship which she enjoyed and she said sorry for hers, never told me the real reason behind it. Whats weird is that she sounded extremely happy, started telling me she bought a 60 inch TV, A ps4, got 2 cats, a bicycle, gym membership same week and was sending me pics of all this and kept saying I am so happy, I am moving on making it look like I was the bad one. I don’t know what all this means or if it’s even normal for a person to get all this stuff like that. She remembered nothing me and family has done for her. Her family and kids that left her and I went to help and take care of her, mow were all good to her and I was the bad one is what she said… Will she ever realize what she has done??? And come off this manic episode if it is...

1801,4ewxnw,I strongly suspect I'm bipolar but not in a position to get a diagnosis. Help?,"First post after a few months of lurking. Hi. This is going to be long, sorry in advance. 

In February I tried taking the steroid Pulmicort (I can never remember the generic name) for asthma management. It made me have a 2-3 week hypomanic episode that ended once I stopped taking it. I don't remember February very well at all, but I somehow was functional enough to breeze through two job interviews and land a job, so...probably not full mania. 

But during that time I happened to come across an online bipolar assessment while researching something else. And it said there was a strong possibility I was bipolar. (Granted, steroids often cause manic symptoms, but my maternal grandmother does have a manic depression diagnosis...)

I have GAD, but for awhile now I've felt like not all of my symptoms can be readily explained by pure anxiety. I was on buspar for a year and a half, then petered off during the onset of a depressive episode (not helped by buspar making me numb and lethargic on top of my lethargic, non-functional depressive episodes). I think my GAD is well-managed, however.

I think I’m more prone to hypomanic(?) bursts(2-4 days) than depression. When I’m hypomanic I work on writing and art more (tho my art quality takes a bit of a hit because I go fast so I can get to the next thing I want to draw), I can’t sleep even after doubling down on my sleep aid (melatonin 3mg), then I stay up until I crash, then the crash only lasts like 4-6 hours, and then that turns into my sleep being irreparably messed up unless I’m *forced* into a normal-ish sleep pattern (school, part-time job).

Even then, I still have a LOT of trouble regulating sleep. I also have this compulsion to start arguments with people (I've improved over the years but it's still present). Otherwise I’m pretty functional? I have a BA in English (minors in greek & classics) and I'm in a long-term relationship.

I get depressive episodes about once a year during late spring/early summer. I have the same sleep patterns as when hypomanic except it’s because I’m too depressed to move from my chair. I don’t really eat or drink. I bathe only when I feel too disgusting to think about anything else. I’m bored. I get hit with a bad case of the stupids/brain fog. Often I get suicidal, but not always. 

When I’m not depressive though I don’t otherwise have symptoms of depression excepting the time I was on buspar? My friend (who has MDD and takes Prozac) had a hard time understanding how severe these phases are for me when I tried to explain it…

I’ve started keeping a basic mood chart but I’m not sure if it’s going to be helpful because my writing is sooo baaad. I want to get assessed & all the physical exams done, but my parents aren’t so accepting of mentally ill people and I can’t drive (I’m 22). I have a part-time job that would give me consideration if I had some sort of diagnosis and my schedule is pretty rigid (library assistant at a comm. college). 

I guess my question is what else can I do to prepare for a future assessment/get help before it becomes a crisis situation? Again I'm sorry for the long post but I'd rather lay it all out here than have to explain to individual commenters...

It is my source of income, but way more importantly: it makes me feel good, it is my hobby, it is my contribution to society, it is what my life makes worthwhile. My mind is occupied with my work 90% of the time, because I love it sooooo much. 

However, I am learning the hard way that my work *can* do me harm. I've been hospitalized twice and that had at least in part to do with my work schedule and the fact that I don't do recreational stuff that much. Don't take time off for holidays or for doing sports. That has bitten me in my ass!

Today I went to see the company doctor to discuss how am doing  now after my recent hospitalization last December. I honestly told her that I am not doing fine yet, but that I'll get there eventually. I am taking extra medicine. I going to do psychotherapy. I only work for 8 hours a day now and I work out. But she told me that I should seriously consider going partly on disability.

Disability?! WTF? There is no way on earth that I am going partly on disability. I can't have children, because I am sure I will be a horrible mother. I am not good at holding on to relationships. My work (and friends and siblings) are my reason to live. I'd rather drop dead than giving that up.

Instagram model (w/ 915k followers and rapidly rising) embarks on an aggressive Instagram campaign to show that there's more to life...than Instagram. She not only re-captioned all of her Instagram pictures to prove this, but posted YouTube videos lecturing her fans about it.

She has over 915,000 followers at the moment, in the the wake of having an identity crisis or revelation about the meaning of her life (supposedly BEYOND social media and her ocean of adoring, envious, and fapping fans)...and is documenting it very loudly and dramatically (...on social media, obviously, to her ocean of adoring, envious, and fapping fans). There are all sorts of questions: Is it all an contrived act, a performance for more attention? Is she bipolar and just torpedoing a massively lucratively career as a model, a mainstream celebrity, and a brand ambassador? Is this going to disillusion some of the general public from being interested in pictures of beautiful skinny young blonde white women? Are her hundreds of thousands of new followers really following her message about disconnecting from social media and not living through a screen?

1815,3jv7uq,"I'm not Bipolar, but I love someone who is. And I'm frightened it will destroy me.","If this is a bit long-winded, know that I've tried to make this as succinct as is possible.

I have reached such a point with my significant other that I have absolutely no idea what to do. I am entirely lost and mostly without any vestige of hope. 

A brief history before I explain: I am 30, she is 27. We have been together, more or less, for a touch over 3 years. She left me for two months at the very end of 2013, but then we reunited and resumed somewhere close to where we had left off. Getting back together was rather difficult for me, but we hardly had time to examine what had happened. More on that in a moment. We originally met in the summer of 2009 and dated for about 3 months before she left me for her recent ex. Shortly thereafter, she had a child, whom is now 5 years old, with her then (and now) ex (There is a long and significant story about this, which is important, but would be too long to include). He's an absolutely wonderful kid and I treat him as if he were my own. 

Shortly after re-uniting in January of 2014, she started bringing up the idea that we should have a child together. We would speak about it on occasion, and I was admittedly reluctant. She had just left me, packed up herself and her son, and moved out of our house. Having a child with someone felt (and still feels) like the grandest commitment one can make to another human being. I wasn't ready for that just yet, still stinging from her jaunt into singledom and my miserably solitary winter (to compound the matter, I also lost the ability to see her son when she left, which was a terrifyingly difficult adjustment). 

After some conversation, and some pleading on her part, we made a somewhat impulsive decision to try to have a child. It didn't take much time. Within a few weeks she was pregnant and due in December. 

The following 10 months or so were generally good. The pregnancy moved along without any issues, and as the year whittled away, the anticipation grew. Her ""issues"" were generally mild when present and whatever arguments there were must have been trivial as I have much difficulty recalling them. Save for a few explosive moments, and maybe one semi-prolonged stretch, she mostly maintained a sort of equilibrium. Further, she was pregnant with our child and thus the most beautiful person on earth to me. I had a very difficult time seeing any wrong in her then. 

In December, our son was born and suddenly life had a brilliance about it that I long doubted possible. The center of the universe abruptly shifted from wherever it had previously been to our son's lap. Life was new. 

Then the New Year rolled in and she began to change. Regress, maybe? I'm not positive. But whatever happened began like a spark on a dry, little leaf and now more nearly resembles a wildfire bearing down on my psyche. My question now is really only about how to survive what is happening.

Thus far I've refrained from noting what her particular habits and behaviors are that relate to her bi-polar condition. If I'm using improper nomenclature, I apologize, there's a certain nebulous nature to the words used to describe psychological maladies and I don't intend to mislabel or denigrate anything, here. 

She is diagnosed bi-polar. She has great difficulty much of the time taking care of basic responsibilities; hygiene, finances, cleaning up after herself, getting to work on time, helping to take care of the children, eating, etc… No responsibility is without an increased degree of difficulty for her. And I have mostly been able to handle this without too much stress. So I pay a bit more for our general expense than she does, even proportionally. So I do the dishes 12 times for each time she does them. So she hasn’t showered for 6 days; deal with it. But the sum of it all has brought me to a very weak point, and what she has been doing on top of not handling these responsibilities has made it seem as if I can no longer bend, but probably fracture. Mind you, this is all cast in the light of raising an infant, which is a constant and every day responsibility with very few breaks. A wonderful, but demanding measure.

What has happened this year, beginning in January and continuing through today has been, exactly, a progression. A progression soaked in so much clarity that is has been impossible to miss.

It began quietly through January and picked up a little pace in February. She began to spend less time with myself and our son. She began to neglect a few more responsibilities around the house than usual. She began to head out a little more often at night and either come home drunk or not come home at all. This pattern was not so oddly interrupted every other week when her eldest son would be with us. While he was around, she would keep some things in check. When he returned to his father's house, she would immediately slip off and the problems grew. It was as if she felt a responsibility to her eldest son, but not to the other two of us.

Our son had begun attending daycare by this point, and even though it was on her way to and from work, she would never drive him there, pick him up, or prepare his bottles and supplies for the day. Of the first 50 or so days he attended, she made possibly 2 trips to the daycare, while I made probably 98 (the daycare is in an opposite direction from my morning commute to work - anyhow, we had agreed to split the responsibility equally). And each morning, I'd get him ready and prepare everything while she either slept in or hadn't even come home from the previous night. 

She began to stop coming home from work. She'd send me a text as she left work at 5:00 PM which read something akin to ""running out to the store,"" or ""just going to say hi to my sister, see you later."" What these phrases actually turned out to mean was: ""I will be leaving work, going directly to the bar, drinking for much of the night, and crashing wherever I happen to end up between 12 and 3 AM. And also, from the moment of this text, I will be completely unreachable, so don't even bother calling. I won't pick up.""

This at first happened once or twice a week. By the beginning of April, it was 3 times a week. And by the end of the month and onward it became regularly 4 nights each week. Those are just the nights she didn't come home. There were many nights in between where she came home once we were asleep for the night, or came home drunk or high and simply went to sleep.

All the while, we had a ""newborn"" to take care of, and eventually an ""infant"" to care for. For a period of time he needed breathing treatments to treat a bronchial condition. They were rather difficult and sometimes she'd be gone enough in a given week where she'd never assist with them. There were 5-day long stretches where she may have seen him for at most, 3 hours. 

By choice. 

Not because of pressing responsibilities, like work, or family, or travel, or school, or what have you. Because she simply preferred disappearing at night to a bar and eschewing the responsibilities of parenthood.

As my frustration, my distrust, my anger, my disappointment all grew, we began to fight much more often. I couldn't really hide the contempt after a while, and when we would fight about what she was doing, her desire to do it again grew even stronger. (I use to contend to her that it felt something like having a stranger walk up to you, punch you in the jaw, and then when you started to get upset about it, he would punch you again, even harder, simply for getting upset about it).

It all sort of reached a head in June when she took off on a Saturday morning to stop in to work for a couple hours; she was supposed to be home early, maybe around noon. I had a lot going on in the afternoon and she knew this. After changing plans quite a bit throughout the day, 4:00 rolled around and she was not home. Very shortly after a text, she shut off her phone for the remainder of the night. The next morning she showed up around 10 AM. She informed me that she had gotten really drunk and decided to drop acid with a few people and crash at their place. Evidently, there was one person with them who did not trip and instead took care of the 1-year-old child that was around them. She apologized lengthily the following day, and committed to not drinking any more. However, that promise didn’t last long, and then she ended up leaving me again a few weeks later for what turned out to be 3 or 4 days.

She had so significantly stopped caring about the family we had just started that it had torn a hole in my gut and I had no clue how to not feel despised and unloved and neglected.

Since June, she has reduced the frequency of the disappearing, but not the severity. And it has become cyclical, where a certain depressive episode will trigger an aftershock of disappearance which manifests in the form of some cruel apathy; it feels abusive and intentional at times. Strike that. It is intentional at times. There is a definite sense that sometimes she takes some pleasure in vanishing completely and without warning, as though it is a heralded act of defiant rebellion against oppression. I just want to rely on her. I just want her to care about us enough to communicate what is happening. I just want to know that she takes our life together with the children seriously. I want to know that she won’t disappear without so much as a word for three days in a row.

It was always chance on how she'd respond to my unhappiness at what had been happening. Sometimes she would apologize profusely and promise that she would make attempts to do better. Sometimes she would acknowledge that the things she was doing were wrong, but say nothing further and show no emotion. Sometimes she would get vindictive and explain to me that the only reason she disappeared so much and didn't help out with anything is because I was such a terrible asshole and was always mad at her about something, so she had to get the hell away. Sometimes she would zone out so entirely that she would not move from a position for hours. Sometimes she would just melt into nothing and take the next day or two off of work and lay in bed. Sometimes I believed that she had more in common with someone labelled ""Borderline"" and that her actions were tinged with a certain apathy and carelessness that bordered on sociopathy. Sometimes the arguments would end with her declaring that she would kill herself and she'd run out of the house and into her car and drive away. I'd be left in a panic, entirely unsure of how seriously I should take the threat. For the hours that follow that, I’d be a wreck. 

Throughout this period of time, we discussed the possibilities of her either seeing a therapist again or taking medication again. 

She very nearly rejects the notion of medication out of hand. To her, it is typically a non-starter and she explains that no medication has worked up until now, so why would it work this time? The medications she was on made her feel like a zombie anyhow. (As an aside: she did have a very questionable psychiatrist whom had her on a 7 or 8 drug cocktail of anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, benzos, lithium and I don't even know what else; it was malpractice, I’d contend, and she eventually tried to overdose on them). Regardless, she might be so opposed to medication that nothing will convince her. Even if the alternative is destruction; of relationships, of love, and in the end, of self.

She had seen a therapist whom she felt comfortable sometime during her pregnancy or before it. I have asked her on numerous occasions to call her to schedule an appointment, and she pays the idea lip service but continually finds a reason to not do so. 

I have reached a point where I believe that I am unable to help her and that she is unwilling to make any real efforts at changing the current trajectory of our life together. If there are avenues for help outside of therapists and medication, she also seems unwilling to pursue them. She appears to have decided that things will go as they go, up and down, circling and repeating into perpetuity until it runs its natural course and either magically resolves itself or else ends in massive emotional turmoil or suicide; which she has legitimately attempted on numerous occasions, though not in about 3-1/2 years or so. That one put her in a coma for a number of days. 

The thought of leaving her is traumatic for me. Though lately, and almost shamefully, it has been a peaceful thought. I don't want to abandon her. I don't want to give up on her and leave her to her own devices. Above all, I don't want to put our son through a life of difficulty and force him to have two separate parents in two separate places. I've seen the effect it has had on her eldest son, and he has emotional issues directly related to it (and others probably directly related to her absenteeism during a portion of his childhood). I also can't fathom the idea of splitting up and seeing my son less often when I've essentially been his primary caregiver for these first 9 months of his life. I am devoted to him and I can't stomach the thought of losing time with him because she has been unable to be around and care and be responsible. 

I don't want to leave her because I still love her. 

Even after being left 3 or 4 times. Even after the emotional abuse. She and her eldest son are responsible for me turning my life around at a critical point. Without their presence, I don’t know that I’d be doing very well today. 

But it has grown to the point where I cannot rely on a single thing she says. I will see her on a Monday, completely motionless and mired in apathy, and I know that by Wednesday she will be vanishing over the next few nights and that by Sunday we will be fighting about it to such a degree that all reason and rationality is lost. I can see what is going to happen 10 days ahead of time as soon as a particular mood falls over her, and it’s happening with clocklike regularity.

The stress of it all has just begun to take a physical toll on me and I’m having some difficulty sleeping and eating. I’m not focusing on things as well as I should. I fall behind at work. I don’t have the time or energy to engage in things which bring me pleasure (music, reading, study). I’ve begun to develop pains that are stress-related (chest & muscle pains). Some weeks I practically wait for her to quietly say “fuck it” and start to unravel. Even if things are okay, there is a pallor about everything, knowing it will all degrade quickly when she decides that it ought to.

If you’ve read this far, thank you for taking to time to understand this situation. I’ve left much out and it is still incredibly long-winded.

I have no idea what to do. Keeping the interests of the two children in mind, trying to keep her stable, and trying to keep me from burning out, I simply can’t solve it. I can’t manage it all, right now.

I feel like a single parent some days. I awaken each day with the expectation that the responsibilities of our life will be shared only to be let down before I’ve had my first cup of coffee for the day. The expectation that she will be there and share the responsibilities is the thing that hurts when it goes. 

I wouldn’t be here writing this today if she had exhibited a willingness to work on these problems and find some type of a solution. So far, she has been decidedly resolute in simply letting things be and “trying harder” when she can manage it. It typically appears that she has no intention of honestly addressing her issues and their consequences. Her answer to much of the problems is often simply “I suck.” And I try to get her past the self-deprecation and not let her put herself down, but I’ve learned that this is simply her way of thinking about things in the simplest way possible and washing her hands of the responsibility for it. It ends the conversation every time. All I can say is “That’s not true, but I need your help.”

We’ve discussed the nature of post-partum depression and she’s explained that of course that’s present, but really it is just the standard issue depression she has dealt with all of her life which just so happens to be taking place after birth. There is no discernable difference between “post-partum” depression and the depression which accompanies her condition anyhow. 

I suppose half of what I hoped to accomplish was to put this down for the sake of compiling my thoughts. 

The other half is to seek guidance and advice from individuals who may have experienced similar situations. 

Do I end it and begin to move in a more positive direction for my son and I? Do I stay and keep pushing her to get help? Do I force the help on her? Is that fair or even possible? What should I try that I have not tried before?

I’ve tried to examine myself over this past year and determine exactly what I’ve done that could be causing these issues. And I’m certainly flawed. As the year has moved on, I’ve become much less patient. I’ve grown more combative and vitriolic. I’ve taken more offense each time and been less and less willing to see her as a person with a serious condition. I’ve gone so far as to demand that she simply grow up and act like an adult and take care of the things which need to be taken care of. Many of these things are counter-productive in approaching her. But I am so deeply hurt at this point, I no longer know how to react gracefully and with perpetual patience. I cannot maintain poise when thinking about what she routinely does. It is just so incredibly hurtful. 

I’m in a very difficult position. I never thought I would find myself here, debating whether or not to leave the mother of my only-9-month-old son. He’s hardly been around and already I’m thinking about shaking up his world and giving up on his mother. I hate giving up. I never do it.  

I’m scared this will shatter my will. I’m scared that I will expend so much time and energy in dealing with and managing this situation that one day I’ll look back on a life which was only ever about maintaining. I’m scared I’ll develop a higher likelihood of stress-related disease or illness and punch of out life far too early. I’m scared that one day she’ll just decide that she’s had enough, kill herself, and leave a wake of destroyed psyches and a pair of motherless sons. I’m scared that she’ll never want badly enough to make life better and will settle for the grand difficulty of this condition and, left untreated, all that entails.

To those whom even peripherally understand a situation such as this, your advice is warranted and welcome. To her, who may or may not see this here; please speak to me about these things. Nothing I've written is a new thought to you, and I wish you'd talk to me about what we can do. Our conversations end up one-sided and I feel as if you simply don't want to think about what is happening.

This is something which I can no longer rely on myself to solve alone. I’m feeling a little empty these days. So, thank you in advance to all whom consider this and respond in sincerity. ",0,0
1816,3it52a,What is the fastest onset of a depressive episode that you've ever had?,"No offense rapid-cyclers, but I'm more interested in hearing from Bipolar I folks.  I kind of expect Bipolar II patients to have sudden swings but as a BP I sufferer, my understanding was that I could expect to be depressed for months or years and then become manic overnight.  Not enter into a near vegetative depression overnight.

I would say I've been mostly stable with some on and off moderate depression for two years now.  And in the past 48 hours I've hit my most depressive point in 10 years.  I've been practically vegetative.  Too depressed to eat food in front of me, too depressed to play video games.  All I've really felt up to doing is sitting in a chair and staring at the wall.  Occasionally I'll start to cry but it just kind of subsides and I go off staring into space again.  My thought patterns are completely abnormal.  I think to myself that if only I could go soak in the pool downstairs...that would...fix something.  I used to black out and end up in strange places when I was depressed in my teens.  I almost feel like I might do that again if it wasn't 105 degrees out.  I'm normally perfectionist when it comes to keeping the carpet vacuumed, and the kitchen spotless but I haven't been able to bring myself to do dishes or take out the trash in days.  One thing that used to really help me when I got like this was to just color in coloring books for hours on end.  I don't have any on hand, but I wish I did because that's all I feel cognitively and physically capable of right now.

I just...expect this kind of emotional coma to come on over weeks or months.  Not days.  It almost seems like PTSD.  Now I do have PTSD, but it doesn't seem particularly relevant to this episode.  My boyfriend was diagnosed with cancer five months ago and I've spent the last five months taking care of him through chemo and radiation.  He's finally cured and finished with treatment.  I feel like this may just be a delayed emotional crash from the stress of taking care of him.  It's just strange to me that it hits the week after we're given the perfect bill of health.

1817,3gxviy,5 year LT relationship with bi polar girlfriend,"Im an average guy 40 years old, with 2 great kids from a previous marriage sharing my life with an attractive 33 year old bi polar woman. ( diagnosed bipolar 2) treatment over 5 years has been all over the place...

The good : She is beautiful, intelligent, funny.  She is creative and talented and when stable she is a light in my life.  I love sharing literature and music with her.  Her depth of knowledge and passion for seemingly small things is refreshing.  I love her.  I have taken care of her and her of me since 2010.

The bad:  without warning she gets erratic, she can stay up for days or sleep for days.  She can't keep a job, her,medical compliance is all over the place.   She is an addict in recovery.  We have had an impossibly long journey.  She is involved with my kids...her relationship is something like a fun aunt on the days she is good...and tends to be ""sick"" and sleep most of the time it's not good.

When she is like this ( and only then ) she becomes absurdly secretive. She makes plans to meet guy friends...usually because that's a sensitive topic and she avoids discussing anything that may have conflict when she is triggered.  Tonight she Slipped out without saying a word of where she went, or who with or when she will be back.  I suspect she met her brother, but for our relationship it's abnormal to not say.   She carries on long discussions with lots of male friends through social media and on her phone...mostly it's harmless, over the years there have been discussions that were too far for my comfort level.

I don't really mind that she talks with them except when they are obviously not interested in just being her friend...and she refuses to acknowledge this.  She has not a single girlfriend.  Past or present.  She was homeschooled by a religious and abusive non treated bi polar mother.

 I mostly mind the phone chats when   talking with these people cuts into out time together.  I actually have an almost physical reaction of anger at the sight of her phone sometimes.

I respect that lots of people have different relationship boundaries....I am a monogamous person and to me couples need to have honesty.  I don't care for the sneaking / lying.  I give and expect brutal transparency.  I tell my SO where I am going, who I'm meeting as a courtesy.

Sometimes she just witholds information.  Like a compulsive liar. Even mundane information...and to be frank sometimes she has nearly / secretly put herself in dangerous situations.  It makes me constantly stressed when she is secretive because mostly it's nonsense but through 5 years of treatment and substance abuse ...there have been times when that behaviour has put her in danger and our relationship in jeopardy.  Lots of times I've confronted her before she does something that she will regret and she ends up sleeping it off instead ...I hate thinking like I have to be on alert for ever.  Like she won't ever have permanent balance and hold her own life together.  

During these times I feel much less like a partner / boyfriend and more like a supervisor.  I hate that feeling.

I know that her behaviour comes during her triggered times.  I also know that her triggered times come from either conflict with our relationship or near any contact from her mother.  Sometimes I just avoid having any disagreement just to avoid her being triggered.

I don't believe she has ever been unfaithful.  She could have if she wanted to, but that part of her life has never really been out of control since she was much younger.  I suppose it's possible but I don't think so.   Before we dated she was in different relationships and I never knew her to cheat physically....although for my boundaries she has had long, frankly emotionally intimate discussions with past boyfriends etc

When it's good it's perfect.

Each time it's bad like it is tonight...I think how I don't want to do this for the rest of my life.   I just feel like I deserve to be treated better.

I just wish there was hope. I'm so tired of it...and even though she is the one with bipolar...I swear I am the one suffering from it.

I've been doing this for a week.  It's mostly therapy. They prescribed me Zoloft, which is an antidepressant, rather than a mood stabilizer.  I told them about my previous diagnosis, but they only see the depression right now, so they took this route. 

My wife is coming in for a family session.  It's not couples therapy, just a meeting to explain the behavior of people with mood disorders and the effects of medication, etc.  She isn't excited, and told me flat out that she probably won't say anything, but she's coming, which is a step in the right direction.  I'm just going to go with the flow.

1823,3clgif,Bipolar girlfriend cheating or just having a certain phase?,"Hello /r/bipolar,

I've been in a relationship with this bipolar girl for a while now and recently she had said that she was having a 'depressed phase' and would like to spend some time alone.
Now, this girl really means the world to me, I love her with all my heart so I decided to agree and give her some time.

This was 2-3 weeks ago.

I just left her alone and assured her that whenever she wanted to talk about something or if there was anything bothering here she'd come to me and we'd talk about it.

The only thing I would do everyday is ask her how she felt, if she was alright and say goodnight, she responded, let me know that she still loved me and that I shouldn't think she doesn't because she been so distant.

So a few days ago she told me she was starting to feel better again and that it'd be a few days at most she needed.
HOWEVER, I had seen her spending extended periods around what's supposed to be 'a friend'.

Now, I tried my daily 'routine' of asking her how she was doing and all that again, but she IGNORED me.

She played it off as if her phone was fucking around and she couldn't send messages, what I doubt since how can she update her 'status' and receive messages when it really would've been offline? 

Now she has been spending the ENTIRE day, doing all kind of stuff she refused to do with me 'because she didn't feel good because of her bipolar kicking in' with this one 'friend'.

What is this supposed to mean and is it common with bipolar people?
I hope it's not what I think it is because that'd break me, and I don't understand why either... I'm always there for her, I want to do anything to make her feel better... Yet I think she lies to me about loving me still and secretly is cheating with that other 'friend' she spends more time on a day with than with me in the past 3 weeks.

1824,3c8jkt,I feel like my diagnosis is wrong. Looking for opinions.,"I recently went through a major depression that lasted probably a couple of months, and then immediately switched to feeling so energetic that I was uncomfortable.  I had the racing thoughts, and I was moving around A LOT more than usual.  I get filled with a thousand different worries.  However, that is the extent of what has been happening for the past week and a half, and it isn't constant.  It seems to start a little bit into my morning and may or may not go away later in the day.  I went to a psychiatrist thinking it might be bipolar II, but I wonder if maybe I was overreacting?  She put me on Seroquel XR, I'm 3 days into it.  

I don't think what I'm feeling is really hypomania.  It just doesn't seem to fit.  I seem to be sleeping normally (and not feeling tired all the time like I was before), I don't feel overly happy past the first few minutes, and I'm just scared that if I take these drugs when I don't need them I will start to feel some negative effects.

I've read of some people who develop a sudden sensitivity to caffeine, and might just be experiencing that.  I also wonder if I'm anemic or have a thyroid problem as both could explain some of the weirdness.  I'm seeing a general practice doctor on the 14th and will bring some of these things up.  I'm also going back to the psychiatrist on the 16th, and wanted some advice on whether I should call her before that and discuss my concerns?

So a few months back my mother almost cheated on my dad as she was suffering from some mental problems after suffering from depression a few years back when her mother passed away. Thankfully we realised in time to help her and my father (who works really hard night and day) help her seek medical help from a psychiatrist. 

Except from gaining a lot of weight from the medication shes taking, she seems really fine now (except for the occasional migraine) in fact I though she was back to normal. Except that today, her facebook account was still logged on and so I decided to check out a few message to see how shes doing. One of the messages said that she has a bipolar disorder and she was really improving and getting better until her son (me) gave her the news that he was going to Australia for a year. A few other messages (to different people close to her) said that she will really miss me and that she can't stop me from doing what I want as I have my own age.

Now going to Australia for a year in a few months time might not have been the best timing in the world, however it's something that I have been wanting to do my whole life and I already booked the tickets, visas and everything.

If I was stressed he'd try to cheer me up by playing beautiful piano and singing me love songs. I'm adding this all so that people do realize there is PLENTY I love about him before I get on to the problems. 

I don't think he has ever experienced manic symptoms and only has mild hypomania. He's never been a danger to me but we're still young so seeing so many horror stories about bipolar marriages scares me because I don't know if he's doomed to eventually progress into a manic stage one day etc. I apologize if this goes all over the place, but my brain is all over the place with everything going on.

Basically long story short, he developed major depressive psychosis (I think I'm no professional so I can't say for sure) where he started hearing voices telling him he was worthless and should kill himself and that's when things really spiraled out of control and he started to withdraw from me and we broke up. That was a REALLY scary time because not only was I miserable that we broke up, but more than anything I was concerned about his wellbeing and suicidal thoughts. That pushed me to go to counseling and I started managing my controlling tendencies and also took a communication class that made me go from saying things like ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING YOU'RE THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY YOU DON'T CARE"" to ""Hey honey, I feel really worried when you lay around all day without eating because I want you to be healthy, would it be okay if we went grocery shopping to get you some more things around to eat?""

I basically fixed many of MY problems in the relationship so that even though my intention is still to help him, it's not coming off in a harmful way. When we broke up, we stayed in touch and specifically told each other we still loved each other. Which made it very confusing as to why he broke up with me. Later I found out it was because he felt he was a burden to me and wanted to save me from him. We talked it out and decided we never want to do that again, and this time we're going to take a healthier approach of tackling these issues.

He once told me he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 16 but it wasn't brought up again and I never understood what it really was. We both just assumed that it was a wrong diagnosis since he doesn't really have mood swings/we've never seen him get manic. After this really scary episode of psychosis and voices in his head though, I started to become worried he was becoming schizophrenic and after a lot of research found that what he was going through was very well actually bipolar disorder.

So now I'm at this point, where I'm healthy enough to communicate with him in ways that will work much better. He's still depressed, but considering the voices stopped, he occasionally has happy days, and he began crying every night he's getting better. That sounds odd to say, but from my own experience, when you hit the lowest depressions possible, you want to cry but can't because you're so hopeless, and I start crying more when I begin healing. He dropped out of college the last quarter, and in 2 weeks he's starting again. I'm nervous about him messing that up again. I'm nervous about a lot of things. His house is still nasty, but I gave up on that because it's such a low order concern. There's so many concerns so I'm trying to prioritize.

My priority at the moment is to get him to a mental health professional to get an accurate psych eval before anything. He's very resistant to medication and counseling and basically doing anything in this state so that's where I need advice. It's hard because in a situation like this, I feel like it's hard to not become a little pushy or controlling when I'm very much avoiding that. 

I'm willing to go through many hardships with him to have a successful and happy marriage in the future. But I'm so new to this all and am stressing like crazy. It doesn't help that my anxiety disorder (that WAS very much under control) is getting bad with this all. 

I guess I'll just list everything that is scaring me and stressing me the most.
I'm scared that he won't accept the help he needs. I'm scared that he'll have another bad experience with medication that'll make him into someone I can't recognize. I'm scared that his disorder will only get worse with time. I'm scared we can't have a successful future. I'm scared that he'll never be ""okay"" again. I'm scared that he will refuse to take medication. I'm scared that if he has to be on medication his whole life, he won't be who I've always known and loved. I'm scared that our relationship will become one sided where I do all the taking care of and work. That might sound selfish, but I'm scared that I'll be more of a caretaker than a wife. Don't get me wrong, I am completely able to deal with being extremely patient and taking care of him, being there for him, feeding him, pushing him to treatment etc. I just want it reciprocated a little bit and am scared that this disorder might make that request too big.

There's a lot of unknowns right now and I can't tell what I'm valid in being worried about, and what my anxiety is blowing out of proportions.

Any advice/successful bipolar marriage journey stories would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone could educate me about anything I seem to misunderstand about bipolar disorder, I'd like that as well. I'm just really trying to educate myself and know what to expect/what I should be doing. Thank you.",0,0

1843,2uylka,First post at 1AM... here we go...,"When I was 14 or so a therapist suspected I was bipolar and prescribed me something and I didn't like it so I didn't take it. Here we are 9 years later, and after two failed relationships, moving from Virginia, to Boston, to Virginia, to Las Vegas, and back to Virginia, quitting 4 jobs without notice in 3 years, countless mood swings, and randomly destroying my life I've decided... I think she was right. However, 5 years ago they lifted the ""bipolar"" diagnosis and decided I had ADD instead and I've been on and off various dosages of stimulants for the past few years which I feel like have SEVERELY impacted my mood swings. 

Anyway, I have done a lot of reading on bipolar and read lots of posts here and finally scheduled an appointment for counciling as well as a therapist for medication. I have been going through a depression for about two weeks and just yesterday started noticing some mild forms of the ""manic"" symptoms I've experienced in the past... increased libido, actually replying to text messages, smiling, oh and pulling an all nighter and staying awake for 30 hours. Basically, I was doing something overnight and took one short duration 10MG generic adderall (the smallest dosage) at 10 PM, 3AM, and then at 6 AM. By noon it had worn off and I was tired but decided if I slept then, I wouldn't wake up until 9PM and then I'd be up again ALL night so I decided to just stay up and then go to sleep later around 9. By dinner time I felt like my eyeballs were going to fall out of the sockets because I was so tired but I stayed awake until 9 so I wouldn't wake up at an odd hour. I laid in bed and snooped Reddit and I felt this really weird tightness/throbbing in my neck which I've felt before but it never really bothered me so I didn't care. I was tired but was so wrapped up into Reddit I didn't even realize 30 minutes had gone by because I was suddenly becoming less and less tired. 10 minutes later I was 100% FULL BLOWN AWAKE AND EXTREMELY HYPOMANIC. I've been having these elated feelings of being completely invincible for years (I once paid $275 for Real Estate Classes and signed up for Portuguese classes online.) but to recognize it after reading so uch was really mind blowing. 

I am already actively seeking some help as my appointments are all coming up in March but my question is... of everything I've read I have never heard of anyone being EXTREMELY depressed for a period of time then suddenly feeling an OVERWHELMING bodily adrenaline rush and going full blown hypomanic within 10 minutes.  Like, I had to read up on dissasociative disorder just to make sure because the change in my mood was UNREAL. I have also read that bipolar disorder can be linked to hypothyroidism. I fluctuate between 90-98lbs (I'm a 4'11"" woman) and was once assigned get bloodwork done for my thyroid a few years ago but did not go because I am lazy. 


TLDR: Has anyone had any experience with hypothyroidism correlating to bipolar or extreme mood shifts in a short period of time with bodily sensations? Or is there an explanation for this? Please tell me I am not crazy.

1844,2tgoir,Hello everyone. I would like to share my personal experience to see if you guys could share your insights.,"I am coming here after self-diagnosing myself with bipolar disorder type 2. I know that it is probably very common for people to misdiagnose themselves with BPD because they do not fully understand the nuances and subtleties of the disorder. That is why I wanted to share my experience with you all to see if some of what I have dealt with sounds familiar. I am in pretty desperate need of help and so your feedback would be much, much, much appreciated. I will try to not make this unnecessarily long. 

I have been emotionally unstable since my early teens. Most adults around me attributed this to my Mother's death when I was 15. However, after much self-reflection, I believe that this instability has been an integral part of who I am since childhood. I am seeing a psychiatrist right now who has diagnosed me with ""adjustment disorder with mixed depression and anxiety"". If all of the pitfalls and bad-decision-making has occurred in my life because I have not yet adjusted than how long does ""adjustment"" take? I'm very frustrated, cynical and without much hope. I am now married with children. Now, the people I love are being implicated. 

Here is my long list of faults. Maybe you guys can sort through them to see if they some how resemble BPD2, or another psychiatric problem:

CHILDHOOD:

-As a child I was violent and hurt other children. At one point I was almost kicked out of preschool. I had tantrums more frequently than other children. 
-I would get angry or upset very easily and, as a result, would not enjoy family trips or things of that nature. Example: I would regret a toy I bought at Disneyland with my limited spending money and spend the rest of the day sulking, not allowing myself to have ANY fun no matter what.
-At times I was wildly creative, ambitious, enthusiastic and inspired. I had ideas for big projects constantly, and would have to beg other children to cooperate with me. 

ADOLESCENCE: 

-I was depressed almost always. I know that this is like the default emotion for teenagers, so I never thought much of it. I thought about suicide often, but not very seriously. 
-Sometimes I hated my peers. I thought I was much smarter than all of them. I thought I was a genius. 
-Other times I found friends that I adored for short periods of time. I would take them everywhere with me and want to be around them constantly. I'd get them to do spontaneous, somewhat destructive things like: ditch school to go to the beach. Sneak onto campus in the middle of the night. Sometimes I'd embarrass my friends by dancing spastically and singing pop songs in the hallways. Again, I realize that these things seem very typical for a teenager. 
-When I became angry or sad, I made a spectacle of myself. I poured milk over my ex-boyfriend's head in the middle of class. I started sobbing because my teacher suggested that if I found the work in AP Lit too difficult perhaps I should consider taking an honors class. Once, I was mad because a friend would not answer her phone even though we had made tentative plans. The friend who was with me told me ""you look really scary when you're mad"" which shocked me enough that I never forgot it. 
-I was curious about drinking and smoking, but thankfully I never really had access to it.

YOUNG ADULTHOOD:

-This is when any sort of emotional instability I has before was amplified by a factor of ten. 
- I went off to college, about 6 hours away from my family. I didn't make any friends. I either sat by my the window in my apartment chain smoking or drank myself to sleep. I became so depressed that I couldn't get out of my bed to go to class. I called my family members crying almost everyday. They told me to ""go join clubs, make friends, blah blah blah you can get through it, it takes time to adjust."" I felt like I really couldn't, and that I needed more help than socializing could provide. This was the first time I very seriously considered suicide. I formulated a plan. Figured out how to execute it. I decided that if my family didn't let me come home or start to take me seriously I would kill myself. Thankfully they did, and I moved in with my grandmother.
-After I came home, I drank constantly. I would go on 2am walks completely drunk by myself and sob in people's front yards. Alternatively, sometimes I would be happy and inspired and would dance through the neighborhood at 2am, also drunk. 
-I was taking classes at the local community college. My first semester went well. The second semester went down hill very fast. I found friends to drink with. I started skipping class. 
-Again, I sort of forced my friends into doing very destructive, spur-of-the-moment things. Take a midnight trip to Big Bear (we live in the LA area). Take a road trip to Colorado instead of going to school. Call in sick to work and spend half our pay checks going to Disneyland. 
-I was even more creative and ambitious than in high school. I had huge ideas for projects that I couldn't possibly carry out. I would, on a whim, decide I wanted to create a website about art. Then I would spend over a hundred dollars on a domain name and forget about it the week later.
-I had huge spending problems. Because my mother had died, I had tens of thousands of dollars in my bank account. Within two years it was completely spent on basically nothing. I bought things completely out of nowhere and regretted it later: a kindle, a laser-star-projector, 300 dollars worth of candy, an expensive evening gown even though I didn't have any occasion to wear it, meals for six friends at a time. 
-I also was sometimes extremely arrogant and vain. I thought I was the hottest and smartest person anyone had ever met. 
-I would start sobbing unexpectedly out of nowhere, sometimes in extremely inappropriate places. At work. In the middle of a house party...
-Sometimes I would lash out at my best friend or boyrfriend out of nowhere. I would become extremely angry and scream at them at the top of my lungs. They always attributed it to my drinking and drugs, as did I. My behavior was so unpredictable that it became a running joke. 
-I had suicidal thoughts frequently, though they weren't as serious as when I went away to college.
-My recklessness led me to sleep with my professor, and have a baby with him. These decisions were incredibly stupid. I thank fucking god that in my haze of bad decisions I accidentally found someone who was willing to marry me that is an extremely good, level-headed person. So so so very lucky.

NOW:

-My baby and husband basically saved my life. I don't ever let myself enertain thoughts of suicide for their sake. I am taking school seriously again and investing in my future because I can't afford not to any more. I do not do drugs and have kept my drinking to a minimum, though it is still a huge struggle. 
-Things should be wonderful right now. My life is stable and happy. We are financially secure, and I am surrounded by people I love that care about me. However, everything is shit because I STILL can't control my emotions. 
-My kids and my husband are being effected. ESPECIALLY my husband. He says he can't predict how I'm going to react anymore. He describes my unpredictability as ""scary"". When I get angry at him, it is for no reason. I become so livid that he thinks I'm going to ""lunge"" at him or ""hit"" him (though I never have). I come out of these bouts of anger feeling ashamed and guilty, not understanding why I was so mad in the first place.
-That is the way I experience most emotions now; they are extreme, and I feel like I'm sort of... drunk on them. I am in a haze of that particular emotion. And just like when you sober up from being drunk and regret all the things you did the previous night, I regret all the things I did in the haze of emotion. Sometimes the haze lasts for a day or two. Sometimes it last for several weeks. 
-The hazes are not always bad. There are hazes of ambition, inspiration, romance/ lust, motivation, excitement, or enthusiasm. I make big goals that I don't usually complete. Resolve to mend an old friendship (I never do), or imagine how amazing the future will be. My husband says that during these times I speak quickly, and am hard to follow because it sounds like I am just continuing a conversation with myself out loud. I become impatient, and must do things I'm excited about right that second-- whether its buying a new rug, making ABC flashcards for my toddler, or writing the thesis for my paper that is not due for a long time. 
-Currently I am very sad. I have to actively try not to cry. Yesterday I was very happy and energetic. I was super sexual and touchy with my husband. Nothing from yesterday to today has changed at all. 


Sorry if this all sounds a bit dramatic. I kind of got carried away. I don't think I've ever put all of this down at once, or really told anyone about these ""hazes"" in their entirety. 

Anyway, I'm at a loss for what to do. My behavior is destructive and hurts my husband and children. The SSRI's I've been taking (for the second time in my life) have no effect, except for a short-lived, hour-long feeling of euphoria when I first took them. I don't know whether something is wrong with me, or my life is actually really difficult in ways I can't perceive, or if I am just inherently an out-of-control person. Either way, my husband says my behavior ""is not normal"" and I agree. When I read about the symptoms of BPD2, they sounded extremely familiar.

1846,2rpvt2,Ways to deal with anger (unmedicated)?,"My doctor has pulled all of my meds, because I am pregnant.
Being pregnant makes me moody enough.  Now the anger is creeping back in.  The littlest things are pissing me off, and it's hard to stop being pissed off.  Plus, I don't like being mad so being mad makes me even more mad.  It's this big cycle of doom.  I was fuming for 2 hours tonight because I misplaced a notepad.  I tried breathing, I tried distracting myself, drinking tea, whatever.  One of my friends recommended meditation, deep breathing exercises, listening to calming music.  But she's not bipolar, she doesn't have any mental health issues at all, she has no clue how strongly a person can feel stuff.  A stress ball isn't gonna cut it when I want to destroy shit and set myself on fire.  Exercise sounds like it might be effective but right now I'm so exhausted and short of breath and sick that I can barely walk across the street without feeling like I'm going to pass out.  The doctor also took me out of work for the next 2+ weeks because stopping one of my meds causes horrible withdrawals so I won't be able to work anyway.  So basically I'll be stuck at home alone every day, pregnant and pissed off at dumb shit.  And once withdrawals kick in I will probably be confined to the bed, because I was the last time I decided to just cut my dose in half (and now I have nothing).

I do have a therapy appointment sometime this month and I can discuss this then, but I have no clue when the appointment is because I wrote it on that fucking notepad that I put somewhere.  Yes, I will call the doc tomorrow to figure it all out.  Also, it's a new therapist so I don't think we'll be working on ""issues"" right away, but more talking about all the life history crap I've been through with everyone else already.

His explanation was that the brain gets bored easily. What we do when we meditate it focus on one thing until the brain gets bored and then let it not focus on anything else. If we start thinking about something else we bring it back to the boring thing and bore it again. This means we are not stuck listening to all of our thoughts but instead can clearly hear just one and then that one can stop leaving us with silence.

1857,2der9c,someone close to me--not sure if he is bipolar?,"Years ago, someone close to me reacted extremely to an everyday event. He was 47 at the time. He found his wife's scarf and pants on the floor where she had left them after coming home the night before. Next to these clothing items was a children's book (belonging to one of their children). She had thrown the clothes on the ground randomly as she got ready for bed. The next day, he came to her in a manic state, saying, ""why did you do that? why did you do it?"" and she asked, ""what? what are you talking about?"" he said, ""in the bedroom. you know what you did."" she said, ""no, I don't."" He said, ""you know. in the bedroom. you know what you did."" She was so confused and didn't know what he was talking about, so she said, ""well show me--what is it?"" he led her to the bedroom and pointed at the clothing and book on the floor. She asked, ""what is it? What do you see?"" he said, ""You know."" 

For the following several years--almost a decade--this has come up again and again. He even said he has a photograph of it. He has brought it up time after time, never willing to explain what it ""means"" or what she ""did.""

Since that day, he has never been the same again. While some form of mental instability seems to have pervaded much of his life, this event sticks out. He won't explain why this was so ""bad,"" he just says, ""you know what you did."" Even in professional counseling, he won't explain the meaning of it. We don't know what happened or what is wrong, but he seems to think this was an extreme offense and we still can't figure out why, what it means, or what he thinks it means. 

I think it's worth mentioning that it's not that he is NOT extremely neat or clean himself--he is messy. So it's not that the mess offended him. Also probably worth mentioning that there has been some drug use in his past.",0,0
1858,2bk5id,"If you wanted to induce MANIA (safely), how would you do it?","I've always had an interest in web design and development. Over the years I've made plenty of sites. Mostly small little things, nothing too fancy.
It's gotten increasingly difficult to get *into the groove* and sometimes I feel like I don't really like it. However, I do, I really DO!

I have the occasional little motivational speech or routine that I go through, but it's not enough.
I was in the middle of a massive update two years ago on the most complex site I have ever created. Starting the site was a JOY. I was up all night, every night and I would code and design till late late at night. I'd guess I was MANIC the entire time I was working for Him. When He emailed me about anything site-related, problems, updates, etc. I had a solution within several hours. Didn't matter if I was in bed already. I'd get up at 12am, or 4am to satisfy His needs. Over time, I kinda lost steam, fell into a depression, and I was fired. My client has since moved on and I fear that that may happen to me - again!!!


So I'm thinking that the best way to keep from getting fired (again) is to whiz myself into a (safe) manic state, and get the job done.

* 1. I stopped my meds over six months ago, against Doctors orders. He knows, as I told him a month ago. My wife is also aware and she keeps a close eye on me daily. I have been playing it safe. Eating healthy. Drinking lots of water. Limiting my sugar and caffeine intake. Sleeping well. And amazingly, I feel great!!! His office is located less than 2 miles from my house.
* 2. In the past, when I am manic, I get LOTS DONE (I'm sure you do too ;)). The last time I was manic, I started playing with Linux and stuff. I built myself an Arch Linux web server that I can access away from home :) I can SSH into from my smartphone. I then made the switch from Dropbox type services, as I now have my own personally hosted solution. That manic high lasted me almost two weeks.
* 3. I know what I'm asking for is dangerous, as most of you try to stay away from your mania. I'm not fearful of it, I'm fearful of the crash that comes WITH IT. The depression part. My lows generally last me a few days, but the highs can go for a week or two.

1860,23og4p,Bipolar Meds and Music Festivals,"**tl;dr:** How to you guys fit music festivals and gigs into your lives and schedules?  Dehydration, people in general and anxiety seem like too bit a barrier to overcome.

I love live music, I love the atmosphere, I love belting out tunes, I even love the sunburn.
Enter bipolar and bipolar medications, it looks like live music might be out of the question for a while.

I like small venues just as much, often better but they seem like they've been ruled out too.

**1. Alcohol**
I know some of you drink on your meds and I'm still undecided.  I drank this weekend just gone with no ill effects apart from exhaustion and a delayed hangover.  Also the shame of realising I can't cope going to a party without drinking.
Anyway, drinking at a festival to me sounds like a big N-O.  The amount of dehydration I'd be dealing with before alcohol even comes into the picture is a scary thought and there doesn't seem to be any way of avoiding it.
If I was to go to a small venue I wouldn't be drinking because I would be driving.  I really don't like that idea.


**2. People**
I haven't got anyone to go with.  I do mean that in all seriousness, I don't have a group of friends, there is no way my sister would be allowed to go (her hubby is a knob about this kinda stuff) plus she'd probably prefer to scrape her eyes out with a plastic spork than endure my music.

Obviously, I could go alone, right?  Well I'm 5ft flat and not the most aggressive soul in the world.  Being able to see anything beyond sweaty armpits involves me getting near the front - I don't mind doing it so much as festivals, even with the bone crushing.  At gigs, I'm a lot more conscious of looking conspicuous being a girl on her own.  I'm not saying anything bad would happen, but the walk from the venue to my car gives me shivers just thinking about it.

**3. Social Anxiety**
The groups I can handle, in theory.  The parts that get my anxiety levels sky-rocketing is waiting in line - it becomes obvious you are alone - and the idea of a train ride home.
Add to that the intense terror I would feel all day keeping an eye out for people I know so I can hide.  Plus the disgust about how whatever I'm wearing makes me look fat/albino/daggy/skanky.  Put all that together with the adrenaline of a festival, and I can smell the disaster from here!

How on earth do you guys deal?  I don't enjoy much and this is really starting to make me miss the old me.  There's one on shortly that I would desperately like to go to can just can't.  Camping alone just doesn't fill me with confidence.

I ignored them, thinking it was a bit odd to be eating in the break room not even 30 min into the work day. Once my coworker and I wrapped up our small talk in the coffee station, I turned to go to my desk and found that no one was there. Is this considered a hallucination? It seems like people see things out of the corner of their eye all the time, so I usually would think not.

Hi HR department,

These are the accommodations I would find most useful. The most important are at the top:

&#x200B;

1. Tasks be given to me sequentially, in writing or with an example when possible, with the depth of detail wanted, and with regular feedback on my task completion and quality.

&#x200B;

2. Understanding from co-workers when I alternate between being highly detailed and then asking a question a second time, or double-checking something.

&#x200B;

3. Infrequent unplanned breaks or a variable work day.

&#x200B;

4. Isolation of desk from loud neighbors and kitchen odors (to avoid distraction)

Thank you,

2739,13xvk15,"Is Dating another Bipolar Person Advisable? If so, where would I look?","Hey guys!  I want to start out by stating my understanding is that there are rules set on this sub to prevent us from making friends, and it is not my intention to break them.

I’ve been having trouble with dating and have a hard time getting past beginning stages.  The initial strong hit of happiness I get from finding chemistry with someone makes my head spin, and my illness always ends up ruining good things before they can start.

I’ve been in a few relationships, and been in love with only 1 of those partners.  She was neurodivergent, probably bipolar.  (We were 16-17yo so I don’t have a lot of details on specific diagnosis).  She understood me.  The other 2 partners were attempts by me of initiating something, and hoping the passion on my end would come later.  That circumvented the issue of ruining it at the start, but the feelings never came.

I’m a 22 year old guy, and my life is pretty well put together.  I manage myself well, and have developed good social skills.  Finding first dates isn’t really an issue for me, but turning them into something is.

So is it stupid to try and seek out someone bipolar or neurodivergent to date?  If not, where would I look?  Thanks for any advice.",5,0
2740,13xumx0,Embarrassed myself at work and need help,"I embarrassed myself with my behavior and not sure what to do. I work for a large consulting firm as a senior consultant. The last project I was on was not my finest moment.

The person staffed with me was not comparable. She was overbearing and you could not compromise with her. I quickly became overwhelmed, frustrated, and turned inward. 

There were times in the project where she would get frustrated with me and tell me . I had lashed out at her in an unprofessional but not sever manner. Throughout the course of the project there were things that people did on the project that I voiced my concern about. Once I was very brash and some I just sounded annoyed. I believed as me and here were peers we should handle it between ourselves but she always suggested I talk to a manager. 

Sometimes I would get so overwhelmed with how overbearing she was that I had to take pto unexpectedly. I also made a lot of grammatical mistakes and lost focus on my work products. They simply were not up to par. Fast forward the project ends and I am about to start a new one.

I start my new project and 8 days later I  get rolled off for 3 reasons that were never discussed with me prior and frankly were untrue. I had a feeling the person I worked with previously had something to do with it and my suspicions were confirmed when she was my replacement. 

As this is my livelihood and I did not do anything wrong to get rolled off I discussed it with HR who is aware of my diagnosis. 

Today I get a formal meeting request with the director and executive of our department for Tuesday. I feel for sure I am going to get fired.

2745,13xtaax,My cocktail: Remission achieved,"I've never posted here before, but I just got my prior auth for another year of rx, and I was just thinking that I'd share my cocktail in case in helps anyone. Background Bipolar NOS (also ADHD... maybe one manic episode, mostly hypomanic ones when they were in that range. Most of the disorder has been mixed depression, but I was always medicated with something, so i truly don't know how my natural state is. 

400 mg Lamictal XR + Aplenzin 174 + Synthroid .112  (hypothyroidism for many years) + Buspirone 20 mg (x 3 times/day) + Propranolol 40 mg (x 3 times/day; first dose is 50 mg)

I can't take IR lamictal because it wears off too quickly and I cycle rapidly. I can't take generic lamictal ER because the product itself is so bad that it hits me all at once (it even looks like a totally different pill).  Can't take generic buproprion hcl because I need the HBR. 

If not for the majorly good insurance (Cigna, from husband's job), I wouldn't be able to take these medications. This is like... 20 grand a year worth of meds. Lamictal XR is insanely expensive, plus it's 60 pills/month so it's double the regular cost of a 30 day supply. 

My only complaint is that I like to joke that I'm a fucking idiot. I say the wrong word A LOT. I don't tell stories well because I forget where I'm going, etc. I don't give a shit. It doesn't impact my large-scale cognition. I'm just... slower. This is the hand I'm dealt and it's better than the illness. I doubt most people who have never dealt with this shit would be okay living with the side effects I have, but we all know what the devil looks like and we know that these are NOTHING compared to the depths of hell of bipolar disorder.

Looking back at it, I was very sick. I actually had a job, though I couldn't really keep the same one for long. I'm married. I managed to keep myself out of the hospital (though frankly I should have been put there a couple of times). And I know it's just because I'm lucky and have social supports and good insurance and access to the best doctors, not because the illness was mild. I don't deserve that any more or less than anyone else, and I'm grateful.

I only got out of bed in the morning everyday because I knew there were more medications to try, so odds were that I'd eventually get better. I did, but I really think I have PTSD now from 7+ years of hell. I'm just recovering from severe DP/DR going back to the first manic episodes.

This is the point where I know that I need my meds changed and hope I don’t go psycho and need to go back to the hospital. 

I feel like I’m an absolute nutcase when I tell people that I feel like this and I know that it worries my boyfriend when I tell him these things. It’s not even that I’m hiding anything or have any reason to worry that someone “hears what I’m thinking.” 

Both of my parents are bipolar but haven’t gotten help. My dad definitely is paranoid… but we don’t really have a relationship with each other just because he refuses to get help and is a severe alcoholic so I choose to keep him at a distance just because he isn’t good for me or my mental health.

Since rapid cycling, I've had about 8 hypomanias and 3 severe manias, been hospitalised 6 times, sent to crisis houses, many meds changes, therapy, ECT.... Nothing is working any more. Lithium used to work a charm for a long time, suddenly it just stopped. I think it was related to me having my youngest kid but I don't know.
My team have provided me with carers because it's become clear I can no longer function living alone and need help. They have said that rapid cycling is rarely permanent, but it's often treatment resistant. They can't help me any more, there are no options left. They have told me to consider practicing acceptance - that this is just how things are and I need to learn how to live with it and around it. To accept I have a significant disability that affects my life deeply. But with that I can also accept that when I'm depressed, it will pass soon enough, and what's waiting for me at the end of that hellscape, is the outright bliss of mania. The cycle continues.

I (m/40+) started seeing a therapist a little over a year ago after I had a pretty severe episode that almost cost me my family. 

Fast forward to recent events and having an emergency session with him after what I can only describe as a manic weekend. Apparently I had never told him my mother is severely bipolar. This was a huge red flag for him. 

For background I have struggled with depression and thoughts of self harm. I've absolutely had manic episodes where my decisions were terrible and usually ended up at a huge financial loss. I've been to other counselors, and even had one suggest that it wouldn't hurt to get checked for bipolar (before COVID). My partner confessed to me that she absolutely has had suspicions for the majority of our 10 year relationship. 

So anyway, I asked my therapist what I should do and he said he has the ability to screen me and label me as bipolar 2, but wants me to go to my PCP for a referral to a psychiatrist/psychologist (?) for a bipolar 1 diagnosis so I can get medication. 

So as I write this I apparently have an official bipolar 2 diagnosis and I didn't even know that was a thing.

I don’t know if I will ever find someone who loves me, for all of me, including my bipolar. 😓","**TL:DR** I’m in a few Bipolar/Mental Health subreddits and what I see bothers me. People say the same things all the time. It’s *always* about relationships failing due to someone with Bipolar. Recently, I’ve finally began to start working with my Bipolar and not against it - due to *the best relationship of my life* ending from the challenges I faced. I’m devastated with what has happened, the conversation at the end was the *saving grace* to actually force me to get the help I need and *be the change* I want to see in the world. I can’t help but sit and wonder though: even if I get the help I need, will there ever be a person similar to my ex who comes into my life and stays despite the challenges I will face from time to time? 😓

———

For *years* now I’ve been wondering why my relationships have continually fallen apart and have never lasted more than 2 months. I constantly questioned everything, (I got answers), but never truly listened and heard what was being said back. 

As time passed, I *very slowly* started to pick up on little things and better understand myself with what I was facing and doing to others around me.

It wasn’t until recently that everything *FINALLY* clicked into place... but unfortunately… it all clicked a little bit too late. 

This click derived from the person I’ve literally been searching for and waiting over the past 7 years of my life. This person was everything I could have ever wanted and more. I was quite literally handed a golden goose on a literal god d a m n silver platter. Everything to be right was right. Timing, similarities, interests, relationship style, even the graduation date were all the same and had no complaint ever about anything! There was literally nothing wrong with the relationship, it was the healthiest and best relationship I have ever been in… but I literally chose to self sabotage and find problems that did not exist because I absolutely refused to believe someone so amazing could come into my life. 

After losing this (I swear) once in a lifetime opportunity (that’s how *crazy amazing* it was), I am ripped to shreds, screaming in agony, with my heart shattered in a million pieces all over the floor.

This was the relationship that taught me I needed to change and actually finish what I started working on a while back.

It wasn’t until 7 weeks ago that I *REALLY* started working on it though… it was 7 weeks ago my heart took such an emotional beating and 6 weeks since the official break up. (During that breakup they expressed all the concerns about me and everything they said were the challenges I knew I was facing and actually admitted to doing wrong.)

———

I would like to *emphasize* that I am *ADMITTING* to all of my actions, accepting my failures, and growing from the mistakes I made through the challenges I was facing. 

I would only hope that through the amount of personal growth I have been experiencing over the past 7 weeks, that if I continue to work hard to overcome and understand this terrible mental illness, that someone will love me for me.

I only hope that someone that resembles my ex will hopefully come back into my life at some point as I continue to grow as an individual and give me the second chance I deserve after going through some very intense self reflection. 

———

I just see so many failed relationships in all these subreddits it’s making me lose hope that I will ever find someone who ultimately lives up to my standards will accept me for everything I am. 

I’ve done my wrongs and admitted to them and I hope someone isn’t afraid to face them with me and is understanding if I slip up in the future.",22,0
2765,13xhwsb,My (F23) boyfriend (M23) told me he can't take another two months of our relationship because of my mental health,"Hi all, 

Ive been with my boyfriend for over two years now, and he has been aware of my mental health struggles and we talk about them frequently. 

He went on a weekend long trip to New York City with his guy friends to party and relax and have a good time. I have no issue with this, but when i was driving him to the airport he was being rude and irritable, and i ended up crying on the way home. The day before we were driving and I was holding in a panic attack and he said he thinks im 'begging for attention' and really just didn't understand or support. It made my feelings even worse, as I genuinely wasn't asking for attention, quite the opposite really. 

He comes back and we didn't talk for a couple of days, but he called me last night. Apologized for how he treated me on the way to the airport, but told me he doesn't know how long he can take of this, said he couldn't do it for another two months, and called me 'dead' multiple times. He says his desire is dwindling and he can't handle my mental health unless things get better within two months. 

I have a feeing in New York he talked to his friends for advice (which i am completely fine with and encourage) but they are all single 'players' who brought him out to clubs where he probably got a taste for what could be. I dont even blame him as i know ive been distant lately. 

Im really struggling and very alone as it is, I have no support system other than him as we moved cross country and have struggled to make meaningful friendships. I have been extremely depressed for months and had a trip to the ER two months ago. I genuinely do not see myself getting better in two months, honesty worse after this phone call and i just need advice as I don't know what to do.",49,0

I love people, but people don’t love me beneath the surface.

2771,13xcg6q,Can anyone explain what the hell happened?,"I'm not even sure if this was a bipolar symptom at all, but it started out like one, so... Would just love some insight!
I'd been depressed for about five weeks and have developed a bit of a drinking problem as well. I had a hangover yesterday, so I didn't drink at all, but was feeling pretty crap the whole day. 
I had been up watching a show until past midnight, which after I told myself I had to try and sleep now—I had the prospect of going to work tomorrow, so I didn't want to sleep (I'd taken a few weeks off and was trying to force myself back—idek why because I didn't have to) but as I went to bed, I didn't feel so tired (even though I only had around six hours of sleep that day, which is not enough for me typically) and then I started talking to myself. A lot. I ended up talking about whether I'd prefer a dishwasher or a dry cleaner and all of the pros and cons to both and many other things I don't remember. Naturally, I'm thinking I'm coming out of my depressive episode and into hypomania. 

I think I fall asleep eventually for a while, but I wake up at some point feeling super anxious and seeing loads of flashes of very gruesome images. One haunting one is me laughing maniacally as my face begins to distort. I also saw a dead baby, incomprehensible bloody parts and a lot of creepy faces. I wasn't asleep at this point, I guess they were daydreams? I get the flashing scary faces when I'm trying to sleep sometimes, but this was particularly intense. 
My mind was cycling so fast through all of these images, and whenever I heard talking in these ""daydreams"" what was said never made sense at all. 

 I fall asleep and wake up many times during the night, and once, I'd gotten up in a panic from an unpleasant dream I was having with my heart racing. All the dreams I had were not nice. 

I've been awake and up about an hour now—I'm working from home, thank god—but I can't really read how I'm feeling right now, only that I'm quick to anger and get frustrated today. 

Anyone have any idea what the last ten hours were about? I wouldn't even know how to Google it.",5,0

I attempted in March and was hospitalized for a week. Was met with so much verbal hostility from my husband when I came home. It hurts so much.

I think I’m in a mixed episode right now. Extremely agitated, paranoid that people are watching me and taking notes to get me involuntarily committed. Not really able to eat, unable to sleep but not tired, nothing feels real. Feels like if I die in this life I’ll just finally wake up from the dream and I’ll be normal. Since nothing matters anyway….. it’s been really hard to not do anything stupid. 

Feels like I’m drowning, slowly. During the big recent depressive episode, I would label the thoughts as coming from my “depression parasite.” That’s what it feels like, after all. Some foreign body in my brain trying to kill me. 

That parasite keeps nagging at me. Some days it is louder than others. Been really loud lately. I’m emotionally and physically exhausted. I hate standing at the sink trying to wash my face in hopes it’ll take away the suicidal thoughts. Feel so damn weak. 

People say it won’t always be this way, that it gets better, to have hope. I’m sure I’m just being delusional, but I truly can’t see a way out. This doesn’t go away. I don’t want this.

Then it just got too hard for him when things got hard and I went into depression. After feeling miserable for at least 2 years, he decided he deserved a chance at happiness and left me. Now he’s in a new house, promoted, has a new girlfriend and all is right in his world. He found his happiness in 4 months. I’m left wondering how he could leave me at my worst knowing my struggles. I also have massive guilt from thinking he went without happiness bc he loved me that much. Is this what we’re destined for? Is this selfish?

2791,13x51o6,Feeling lost and frustrated with myself,"I'm  sure there are many threads like this, so I'll try my best to keep  things brief. But we'll see how that pans out, as the situation is a bit  of a doozy. Or perhaps, the much-feared combination of doozies. A  multi-doozy epoch, if you will.

At  the outset of the pandemic, I got laid off from a job where I had some  decent opportunities and great, supportive colleagues. I had a tough  time finding work after that - quotidian lockdown stressors, job  hunting, and maladaptive coping strategies sent me spiralling into a  manic episode where I had to be hospitalized... Obviously this was  world-shattering and terrifying.

I  spend the following year-and-a-half working a job where I feel totally  underemployed and useless. Once my contract runs out, I find myself in a  near-identical situation to 2020 after my contract expires.

Out of work -> bored -> depressed -> pot/alcohol -> funny farm for a few days.

This  time was much worse and I successfully scared the living shit out of my  partner and friends, only bolstering my sense of alienation further.

This  time, my manic behavior was so awful, that I had to move back home with  my parents due to the way I was treating my partner. The immediate  month out of the hospital I felt totally estranged from reality and  living back home brought to surface many reminders of why I moved out at  such a young age.

Some key things to note.

One,  I am aware that I am a fucking idiot - if insanity is making the same  mistake twice and expecting different results, then the shoe does indeed  fit well.

Two, my partner after  both episodes has chosen to stay with me. I am confused, yet eternally  grateful for that, but I will eternally feel guilty. So that's a healthy  dynamic, especially when talks of marriage are on the table (I have  suggested couple's therapy and she's amenable).

Three,  my experiences with my industry (biotech) have left me completely jaded  towards the field. Yet, I am at the moment pigeonholed by my  experience. I want to switch careers (IT/lab automation/data  science...I'm open to options), but I am completely at a loss for a path  forward. A master's degree seems most sensible, but where is the money  for that coming from when I'm currently unemployed and still saddled  with undergrad debt?

Four, I do  have a psych and therapist. Still unsure if the meds I'm on are right  for me though (wellbutrin+celexa: been equally interested and repulsed  by the idea of ketamine therapy or my skin potentially falling off via  lamictal).

Despite these  experiences, I am still at my core an ambitious person. I love learning  and desparately want to improve my circumstances, however as I get older  (28 now...) my preoccupation with past failures and acute awareness of  limitations set forth by Time (and how I've routinely mispent it)  hampers my motivation. Too many of my figs have gone black as I sit  paralyzed with regret and self-loathing.

I  have no schedule right now and every fiber of my being seems to resist  creating and adhering to one. Why? I can only guess, but as with other  failed attempts at self-improvement, it's most likely distrusting that I  will actually follow through with whatever my new goal might be. I  usually stick to a new habit for three days or so then just say 'fuck  it' and return to complacency.

7 Habits of This Highly Ineffective Person:

1. Eating/drinking alcohol out of boredom (for the record I completely quit pot, at least)
2. Joylessly masturbating multiple times a day and then self-flagellating over porn usage
3. Waking up to a 'PM' on the clock
4. Chronic procrastination vis-a-vis video games, half-assed engagement with hobbies, scrolling
5. Refusing to exercise and taking minimal action towards self-care
6. Engaging  with the world in such a negative, critical light and almost believing  that those who don't (aka those who are happy, or at least content) are  ignorant...
7. Leaving the door and windows unlocked for Comparison to come and go, looting happiness as it pleases

Awareness  of these issues obviously isn't enough, but I feel like I have so much  to overcome that overwhelm just pushes me from one shitty habit to the  next, creating the illusion of activity.

I  want to give up (or more realistically...severely limit my usage of)  alcohol, pornography, sugar, social media - essentially all those common  Opiate of the Masses types of things. And start exercising, reading the  hundred or so books on my backlog, reengaging with hobbies in a  thoughtful way. However, I just find a litany of excuses. Or in the case  of something like choosing a book from my library, I'm greeted with the  doubt that I'll finish it and even if I do, when's the next time I'm  going to find the motivation to read another one? Surely it's a futile  effort...(\*eyeroll reacts only\*)

I  want to exercise, oh but my bike is too small and I don't have the  money for a new one...What about body weight exercises? Yeah, I  guess...I don't have a yoga mat though... How about going for a walk  then? My neighborhood isn't very walkable and I don't want to drive  somewhere just to walk, seems silly.

I  want to improve my coding skills, but oh there are so many languages  and I'm too dumb to remember syntax and vocabularly, let alone  logic...Well you can just do what everyone else does and google those  things as need, plus didn't you take many advanced math courses in  undergrad? Yeah... but ever since my hospitalizations, I feel stupid and  incapable of remembering things.

I  want to be more intentional with my art, but well there are so many  more talented writers/musicians/artists out there and what are the odds  of getting exposure? Shouldn't the primary goal of art be to nourish the  soul or whatever? Yeah...but, I should be using that time to job hunt.  Yeah, I suppose, but you aren't, you're just in bed, playing Tetris 99  ad infinitum and listening to shitty podcasts...

I  just want to find the motivation to get back to work. Having income, a  place to go, a slight sense of purpose would improve my overall  situation greatly.  I have been searching for months and have landed  interviews, a handful going to final rounds, only to get ghosted at the  offer stage...I just feel less and less resilient with each setback. I  used to be strong and iron-willed - I would like that back.

Unsure  what the end goal of this post is, I could really go on for hours.  Perhaps it was just to force myself to get some of this bile out of my  body and onto paper. That said, I'm always open to thoughtful  suggestions and enjoy the comfort of shared experiences.",3,0

But what about this in-between feeling? Like you're feeling sort of okay and you're functioning, but you get those waves of sadness that come and go? It's like I don't know what to do with myself. I guess that's how I'm feeling now. I don't feel manic or depressed, and I'm so used to feeling one or the other. It's almost easier. I think I was manic last week or the last few days, but today it's like I'm fighting to stay in a good mood and be productive but I have this niggling feeling of desperation like I'm starting to crash.

I upped my lamotrigine dose two weeks ago (150mg/day now) - I think it does work for me and I don't hit the super low catastrophic depressive episodes, but perhaps that's what is making me feel weird? Otherwise, maybe it's me becoming more self-aware of my mood cycles and I feel like I'm going to enter a depressive episode. But in that case, it's not a good thing because I'm paying too much attention to my moods? I don't know, it's driving me up the wall.

2795,13x3t5v,I think my job is trying to push me out. What do you think?,"Hey friends. I want to make sure I’m not having a severe emotional reaction by having fresh eyes view my situation. I tend to think people are rejecting me a lot, so I want to be sure I’m in the right…

I am recently employed with a full time job as of 3 months ago.

This was a big win for me and I’ve been so proud of myself.

I went in with bright eyes and ready to learn. I have made it a point to be social (within reason) with my new department. I’ve been kind. I’ve been eager to learn. 

So now we’ve hit 3 months. My training has been here and there. There’s no specific person in charge of training me. A lot of what I’m learning was either quickly explained in passing or even worse, I’ve self taught myself. 

Despite this, I’ve still kept a great attitude and have worked hard. Even more important, I think I’ve performed wonderfully despite the circumstances. My supervisor and I have discussed this at my weekly check in and she tells me the department is going through a big transformation and that they’ll get me fully trained “soon.” 

Then this past Friday at my check in she tells me two coworkers came to her about two mistakes I made. Well guess what? It was two things I wasn’t trained on. Who woulda thought!! She tells me it’s either sink or swim and “we’re a family” and she wants me to swim. The plan was to have me with a coworker this week pretty much sitting at her desk daily getting intensive training. 

Well this week has come and I’ve politely told this coworker that I’m ready to train and appreciate her time and to email when she’s ready and that i’d head over to her desk.
Guess what? She never got back to me either time. 

Then today, to top it off, a coworker decided to LOUDLY talk about me to another coworker saying Friday is going to suck because a few employees that work the same role as me will be out of town and she doesn’t believe I’m capable of holding down my end of the work and that she’s going to have to do it all for me and she was very upset. She vocalized this very kid it just around the corner from my desk. I have never once asked her or required her to do my work? It was a weird, rude, and passive aggressive comment. Plus she didn’t talk to me about it, she talked about ME to other people about it. I don’t behave like that. 

Lastly, the two coworkers that reported my tiny two mistakes I’ve made since starting are now giving me the cold shoulder. 

This isn’t fair. I wasn’t properly trained, have still performed exceptionally, and I’m being punished for THEIR lack of training. 

Anyway. I’m going to talk to my supervisor tomorrow. I’m upset and I don’t think I’m overreacting.

Mild thing happens->get upset->start thinking about suicide/hurting myself

I am doing a good job in not actually hurting myself over thoughts 

I do actually hate myself and I do think the world would be better if I didn't exist and that I deserve to suffer and I wouldn't have to struggle so there's benefit that way BUT I cannot actually kill myself because that would fuck up my family and I understand it's just a depression and it comes in cycles I get like this so.

I can't really avoid all triggers. Some I can like my boyfriend yelling during road rage set me off once, but then there's saying something awkward in a social interaction that'll set me off and like I don't really have the socializing skills I need and it's worse for me to be alone so.

Question is: how do I change my brain's response to stress to something like ""oh I'm so sad that happened"" instead of suicidal Ideation or wanting to hurt myself?

I am going to therapy and I have been on psychiatric medication for about 8 years. Unfortunately because I have been on these meds for so long they no longer work as well as they use to and I've essentially been told that I need to find other ways to regulate. We tried changing the meds a lot and they help but they don't help as much as they use to. Sometimes they even make it worse. Currently on zoloft 25mg and seroquel 226mg.

I also can't stay asleep throughout the night and it's been like that since November.

3) Go about my day (getting increasingly anxious)
4) About 4-5 hours later and my Vyvanse has worn off, but I still feel really, really anxious
5) Try to be productive; doesn’t work
6) Go back to my room, ruminate, and sulk; think depressed thoughts of varying degrees
7) Get a second wind later on, at night (sometimes after 3-4 beers or so)
8) Go to bed “happy” (at least not depressed)

I have been depressed, hypomanic, and manic before. This feels almost like I am getting a taste of hypomania and depression.

Vyvanse has been a lifesaver (started in January), but recently I’ve been running into this problem. My main issue is that it’s hard for me to be productive. It’s like my anxiety constantly sharpens its teeth to scourge me with increasingly biting remarks.

When I feel “depressed,” it’s easier to snap out of it than when I’ve ACTUALLY been depressed in the past. But, when I’ve ACTUALLY been hypomanic in the past, I have so much energy that I don’t even have time to think depressed thoughts. I feel like I’m bouncing back and forth.",5,0

I’m a stay at home mom and it seems like my only friends are my kids. I honestly think I’m a functioning alcoholic and it makes sense because it does run in my family. 


I don’t even know why I’m posting this I guess just to see if anyone else can relate. It would be nice to have friends to talk to because I already struggle with my bipolar and BPD. It seems like nobody can relate to what I’m going through like not even my husband understands it’s hard to relate to anybody honestly.


My husband doesn’t want me working because of stuff that has happened in the past when I was not medicated. Basically, I ran away for three months and did some not so smart things so he really doesn’t feel comfortable with me working which I mean I don’t blame him. I was a piece of shit before I was medicated.


Sometimes it just gets to me that this disease I have. I don’t mean to whine about it but it truly sucks. I look at my family members and I see them thriving and doing so good in life not saying that people with bipolar don’t do good in life, but in my situation I’ve been terrible.

I am dying of end stage heart failure and today I was officially transferred from my regular cardiologist to a palliative care team. According to theories about death and dying, I should be depressed, grieving, something. But I'm in an up phase of my cycle (I'm effectively medicated, but I still know whether I'm slightly up or slightly down.), so I'm pretty serene. If anything, I'm happy.

So my theory is that the only thing that supposedly triggers an episode up or down is internal BP processes that come from the illness. The illness causes our episodes, nothing outside of us. So I don't need to worry about this sub triggering anything. What do you think?",31,0

I was diagnosed with depression, ocd, and social anxiety disorder at 15. Started taking seroquel and hallucinated all throughout high school, which mainly started after I was in a traumatic car accident where a kid died in front of me.

I got worse and was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at 19 after my boyfriend at the time assaulted me. I was put on one antipsychotic after another and developed psychosis so bad that i was hospitalized and put on latuda which caused tardive dyskinesia. Pill roulette ensued, and I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder at 21, told I couldnt have children (ever) because the meds would harm the fetus, and it would be impossible to stop them even for 9 months.

At this point, im 23, devastated, cannot keep a job, previously on the deans list ive now dropped out of college and go to vocational rehab for job training. 

There, my boss who was 11 years older wore me down and we start dating. Unbeknownst to me he was a heroin addict, so he becomes increasingly more abusive, assaulting and stealing from me regularly. He supports me so i feel i cannot leave and get pregnant at 25. I finally realize i need to protect our unborn child when he assaults me while pregnant and when i leave, he overdoses and dies. I have a miscarriage a couple days later

6 months later, I develop qt prolongation and have to get off my current antipsychotic. My psych says i dont have schizoaffective disorder. She apologized and says i have bipolar. I still dont get better years pass, still cant keep a job and meet a man who i date at 28 who pays for me to see a new psych finally.

New psych is appalled ive tried over 30 diff medications and says there is really nothing left to try. He says i show no signs of either schizoaffective or bipolar disorder and that the medication is clearly hurting not helping since i have so many side effects. He said to stop taking my mood stabilizer immediately and instead get intensive trauma informed therapy for emotional dysregulation. Thats my new diagnosis after 13 years of switching meds & never getting better. 

Im still taking cymbalta for depression and chronic pain, and im on the lowest dose of tegretol so he said i wont experience withdrawal (doubtful..)

Last night I decided to not take it as I have a lot to do today and didn’t want to sleep through the day or be drowsy. I thought I’d be able to fall asleep  eventually but I wasn’t able too, I was just so paranoid and skittish over every noise and movement. I had assumed that the seroquel was just making me sleep fast and that’s what helped with my sleeping habits but I’ve noticed that throughout the day I wasn’t quite as paranoid. Is it possible the seroquel has tuned down my paranoia and this early on it?

I can’t seem to get my shit together despite my numerous efforts and trying to go back to university and dropping out many times, I also have severe relationship issues and basically zero support system because I have locked myself in my apartment for the last 2 years. I have constantly moved around my life so I have no real close friends who I can trust and feel comfortable with other than my partner and she has major depression and I feel guilty dropping any issues on her because of how it can be really impactful on her mental health.

I’m starting to realise I’m just an asshole with zero empathy and after all the crazy shit I do I have minimal remorse, like spending all my money on drugs and not considering how that will impact my partner or going off at someone for the slightest bit of criticism even if it’s more so just intended to be advice.

2839,13wlo1b,"Recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, struggling to process all that’s happened now that I’m discharged","I (22F) was diagnosed with bp1 after a psychotic/mixed episode landed me in the mental ward. It was a really confusing and terrifying experience because no one in the ward would explain to me why I was there and I didn’t know what psychosis meant on my intake form. I guess I was put on a hold? Or committed by the psychiatrist at the ER? The details are still really murky to me because this was the first time I had ever been full blown manic and I was like that for the week I was committed. Only when I was coming down did I realize that half of the people I thought I saw were visual hallucinations. To think I could be so detached from reality was traumatizing. I never experienced mania or psychosis before the hospitalization and only got a bipolar diagnosis when I was discharged and went to a psychiatrist unaffiliated with that hospital.

My whole life I thought I was just clinically depressed like most of my peers (I was diagnosed at 18 but didn’t pursue medication for my depression due to unsupportive parents). My life was going relatively well before my first manic episode; I was making new friends, living alone in a dream city, interviewing for a dream job, seeing a guy I really liked. Then my manic self just bulldozed everything. While most of my friendships and other practical parts of my life remain intact, the thing I regret most is how I spammed and totally creeped out the guy I was seeing with deranged texts and photos because I was convinced that God had chosen us to be the next Virgin Mary and Joseph (I still cringe over this). I’ve already apologized to him but I recognize that I cannot salvage things. It’s really hard to move on because I was having such a great time getting to know him. I understand I need to focus on myself right now by taking my medication, cultivating healthy habits, sleeping well. I just can’t help but mourn all the things that could have been, especially because those actions weren’t in my control. It’s hard to accept that everything is somehow different now, even if that hospitalization and everything leading up to it felt like a horrible dream.

If anyone has any positive relationship stories, or ways they navigated this illness in their twenties/when they were first diagnosed, I’d really appreciate it. Just need something to look forward to.",20,0

2847,13wftn7,I finally feel happy,"I’ve been describing the past week as “the third worst week of my life.” I started feeling low and put myself into a really unsafe situation more than once.

Yet when I went to therapy today, I started telling my therapist about how I actually feel good. Sure it’s been a rough last few days, but I still feel happy. I am capable of feeling happy.

For a long time, I couldn’t feel happy. I always felt low or numb. I never got the euphoria that some get with mania. Just feeling out of control and panicking. I thought I would never feel better. That I was doomed to always feel bad.

Two years ago I finally started getting on the right meds. I’m now on a good combo that works for me. I’m sitting in bed right now after baking bread and watching a movie with my sister just smiling.

She doesn’t even think I have bipolar disorder but I’ve been diagnosed bipolar by 3 separate psychiatrists!!! She said I have cyclothymia instead. So now I’m questioning everything. Also I have debilitating adhd and the main reason I was going to her is bc I need adderall re-prescribed. She said I need to start a mood stabilizer to be on stimulants which I understand and agreed to. She wouldn’t prescribe the adderall until I’ve been on that for a month. So after a month I’m thinking she will prescribe the adderall and she’s like “well I need to see all of ur documentation from ur past psychiatrist and a full panel of labs and a urine drug screen”. So I sign a release of information form and get all the blood work and drug screen. But idk I feel like it’s kinda weird that she is refusing to prescribe me a medication that I literally need + helps me a lot until she sees these documents. I honestly don’t know why she needs to see them lmao, I think it’s bc she doesn’t believe I’m bipolar but whatever. Also my past psychiatrists never asked for a drug screen for adderall before. And ofc my labs and drug screen came back normal and negative for everything so I sent them to her last week and made sure she received them but she still hasn’t wrote the prescription for adderall like she said. I’m just frustrated it’s been a long 2 months trying to accomplish things without adderall and I’m debating just finding another psych because she is being so weird.",3,0

i was diagnosed pretty young and started taking medication for anxiety, depression, and bipolar in middle school. i have bipolar 2 and because of medication and therapy, i have been able to manage for the most part. i have recently started a new job, finished my first year of college with a 4.0 GPA and i’m going outside and hanging with my friends more often. these are supposed to be good things right?


i don’t know why the swings are back. i’m trying so hard to hide it as i really don’t want to worry my parents (especially my mom as if i look even a little bit upset she freaks out). i’m doing everything i’m supposed to do. i have more bursts of mania and more depressive episodes than i’ve had in a long time. i don’t know if it’s the stress from school and my new job or if something just isnt working. i’m afraid that it’s going to ruin everything again like my relationships, school, or my job.


anyways, i just wanted to get some feelings out and get some insight from others who may be going through the same thing.

2856,13wcylw,My parents took away my car two days ago and now I'm losing my mind,"My parents just took away my car, I'm 22 so I feel like I'm being treated like a teenager. I left the house for a semester to stay at college and get away from them. I just moved back about 2 weeks ago and they're already doing this to me. I'm not trying to play victim, so I'm sorry if it sounds this way. This is just very important to me because I have no money currently since I was overwhelmed at school when I got a job. They wanted me to do 40 hours of online training. That mixed with school, I ended up doing neither because it overwhelmed me too much and because of that I only did one shift at the job because they wanted me to complete the training sooner and I only started it the day before my shift. After that unraveled I started looking for a new job but only just now found one. I start mid june so I most likely will have money 3-4 weeks after I start it. My parents won't allow me to use the car for anything other than work and since I won't have money I'm either trapped at home or anywhere I can bike or walk to since I have no money for train or anything. Unless my friends pick me up to do something which I won't have any money for. There is only one bar near me my friends go to and that's the only thing within my distance. The reason they took away the car was because I ran a red light, I was following a big truck I guess slightly too close so I didn't see the red in time to stop. I've learned to space myself better. They are doing this because they are mad I have been doing doordash in between looking for jobs. I've only been doing it for pocket money for gas and to see my friends, go to a small $15 show. Things like that. 

I feel very trapped and I already tried hurting myself and I cut holes into my wall. It is so hard for me to overreact. I know this seems like something so small, but seeing my friends and going to a show, these are the only things that make me happy and keep me alive. I am constantly suicidal and struggling, but my family does not see that at all. They say that I am faking along with other things. And before you ask if I'm diagnosed, I am. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and a multitude of other mental illnesses that I'm pretty sure were just wrong diagnoses and I only have the bipolar. But yes, I am on medication, I'm diagnosed, but this medication does not help with everything. Any drastic changes in my life can overpower the medication helping me. 

I want to move out, but I feel trapped. I don't know how to move out, I feel like I lack all life knowledge. My dad even refuses to teach me how to change my tire. I told them I will pay the insurance once my new job starts paying me. I struggle in every job, it is so hard for me to keep a job because of my illness and instead of support they just constantly put me down, even my sister who is 19. I feel like this is all my fault and I should've just forced myself somehow to do the online training for the other job and maybe I could've had some money saved by now, but I constantly ruin everything. I feel I never have any real support and I feel alone and hopeless in what to do. I can't even take more classes. I dropped my classes down to 2 and I couldn't even do those, I had to withdraw towards the end of the semester since I didn't want F's. I haven't told my parents this and don't plan to, if anything I would be paying it back, I have full financial aid so all of my school has been covered. 

I just wish I had done everything and figured out how to leave by now, but every small problem that happens in my life crushes me so badly I want to take my life or hurt myself and then nothing matters to me and I feel like I can't accomplish anything. I know that once I move out I'll be able to finish school over time and feel better, but at this moment it is so hard for me in this house. My dad is a very mean person, my parents are both polish immigrants so they think I have it easy. I have so much trauma because I was always labeled a bad child and meanwhile I had bipolar the whole time and instead of therapy and help and understanding I just would get yelled at and hit. They have such a bad image of me and my dad says horrible things to me everyday. Any single thing he can think of to hurt me, make me feel like a loser, anything to get his internal anger out. Then they both want me to praise them. Paying for my car insurance and letting me live in the house to finish college doesn't equal emotional abuse being okay. He constantly gaslights me, manipulates me, and accuses me. Today he accused me of stealing hundreds of dollars from him which I didn't do and wouldn't ever. 

I can't express any emotion ever or they threaten to call the police or take things away from me. I already feel like I have so little to live for and I feel embarrassed that something as stupid as not being able to use my car and having no money for 2 months is hurting my mental health this badly. I'm still trying to get over losing two friends over them thinking I was flirting with their boyfriend which I btw didn't do and wouldn't do to my friends. I entrusted my parents with this information still during the semester and since I've been home my dad has used it as another thing to hurt me. He says I can't keep any friends and that I have new friends every month which isn't even true. He expects me to have the same friends from high school just because my sister does but my friends from high school did horrible things to me and for that reason they are not my friends anymore. I am just over being hurt so much when I'm already struggling so much.

And now because all of this I have so many bad thoughts on my mind because of the depression creeping in. I'm starting to feel like my friends don't like me and they don't want to talk to me and now I want to ignore them and not talk to anyone. I feel like I'm only a crybaby and just bother them, I try not to say anything about how I'm feeling but I think sometimes I need to for them to know why I'm acting a certain way etc.

I'm sorry this is so long. I just really need help. I don't know how I'm going to make this plan and don't know where to start, I'm just a broke college student. I have 2 1/2 years of schooling finished only and in my major I have to get a masters in order to make decent money. The only amount of money I really want is to have somewhere to live and enough money to go out with my friends. I'm trying to become a social worker, but with how horrible my mental health keeps getting I have no idea how I will finish all that schooling. 

Can anyone help and tell me any advice? How do I get through this period of time staying somewhat okay? I am going to call therapists tomorrow, but my last therapist only ever made me angry after every session so I have no idea if only having a therapist will do much. I'm just very scared of hurting myself badly and I don't want it to be over something like this, something so dumb.",3,0

I don’t really visit this subreddit that much because I really have no questions to ask. I’m doing really well so my mind is on other things and any bipolar-related issues I have, I have plenty of experience now and know pretty well what to do. So you don’t hear from me at all.

I just wanted to say that it’s important to realize that many people are like me. Scrolling through posts, it may seem like a horrific prognosis and endless problems, but in reality, *only those who need support post here*. The people who are stable don’t typically regularly browse Internet forums so there is really zero representation of people like me.

I have a few different diagnoses and it can seem like life is hell, based on the Internet forums. The majority of subreddit forum members are seeking support because they are having a difficult time. Those that are stable and well managed don’t post because they are off living their life and don’t need advice.

The worst part is never truly knowing who you are. I look back at myself (text messages, Facebook messages, memories if I have any) when I was in an episode (depressive or manic) and I literally don't recognise that person. I find myself saying ""Am I really like that? Who is that person?""

Combine that with the dissociation (not being in my own body for the majority of the time) and I don't feel like I know myself or ever will. Does anyone else get this or is it just me?",1005,0

3440,3tzvqo,Things I wish I'd known about bipolar,"I wrote this up to process my experiences this year with the thought of maybe sharing it online. I already bugged everyone on facebook about what I was going through when I was going through it though, so maybe not. I thought I'd post it here anyway. Maybe it's helpful to some people.

**Mania feels like enlightenment**

Mania brought out huge emotions that I never knew were in me. I felt deep feelings of love some days, anger others and an all-over general disregard for consequences. It doesn’t matter what I did, I felt validated.

The thoughts I had were all-important. I had a right to whatever good thing life threw at me and I was convinced I could get along with everyone and if I couldn’t, well it was their fault.

Having such a big shift in your thought feels spiritually important when you’re in it. I’m not the only person who's suddenly found their spiritual side out of nowhere.

You see madness coming as you approach it and then suddenly, *wham*, you’re Neo and you have to save the world. This is different, you’re not mad, you have purpose. Life isn’t a confusing march to death after all!

**Depression taught me there isn’t a *real* me**

I thought I was someone who enjoyed exercise, but one day my body felt heavy and I couldn’t go to the gym any more. I thought I was someone who was intelligent, but one day my brain was like treacle and I couldn’t do my job. I thought I was someone with a sense of humour, but one day I couldn’t even come up with words. I thought I was someone with friends and family who I loved, but then I trusted no-one.

You get back to this blank state of nihilistic solipsism and have to rebuild one block at a time.

**Normality is the bit that feels unstable**

I’m fairly convinced most people go through life feeling a little bit fragile and unsure of themselves. They know an unkind word could send them into a pit or a kind word in the right place could make them feel on top of the world.

A mood disorder is the negation of all of that. You feel one way. Manic, it doesn’t matter what someone says to you, you are on a mission. Of course they’re telling you you’re crazy, you’re doing something no-one has done before. People thought every great person was crazy. But soon you’ll prove them all wrong.

People humour me when I’m depressed. Or if they’re not humouring me it’s only because they don’t know my deep, terrible secrets. And they’re all terrible too. I'll remember every little thing they ever said or did to me. They feel obligated to me as a friend, of course, but I know they’d rather be with anyone else.

**Mood swings make me dumb**

I like to think I’m reasonably intelligent, but trying to do my job whilst going through a depressive episode was hopeless. I had a system where I’d have evernote open and write timestamped notes as I was working. I’d lose focus every minute and have to look at the list of things I’d been doing. Even then my brain was like treacle.

And amnesia is a huge side-effect too. At the deepest depression, your entire mental vision is filled with your regrets. You can’t remember the joy you felt on your childhood holidays or even what you were doing that morning.

Strangely, you can remember everything negative. Not just about you either, about everybody.

I hope I never take my life, but knowing I get to a place where I'm retarded; can’t remember anything positive; where my body feels heavy and I feel generally like a worthless, unattached piece of shit with no sense of identity scares me. It’s not a game. I know what I value about my life now, but when I’m in that pit, those memories aren’t available to me any more.

**You have to learn trust**

Losing touch with reality and having a brain that didn’t work meant I had to trust other people to think for me. Whether it was nurses, doctors, family or friends. I have been severely retarded for months this year and I am infinitely grateful to everyone who put up with that.

You can’t judge how mad you are yourself. Your brain’s entire internal logic changes. All the time you’ll feel like whatever you’re doing is the most natural thing in the world. I have done bizarre stuff, but it all seemed normal, at the time.

There’s a point when you have to toss your life’s keys to someone else if you want to be safe.

**Apologies are complex**

Do you apologise for what you said manic?

Do you apologise for being bad at your job depressed?

Do you apologise for making inappropriate advances, losing your cool, getting in fights?

Do you apologise for not answering calls, not tidying up after yourself, being surly?

Do you apologise knowing that if people can’t put up with you being unreliable sometimes, you’re going to have to apologise again and again?

It’s fair to say I regret a huge portion of my life. There are people I’m probably never going to talk to again. And all through the episodes, it’s still me, but what do I do with that? I know what I did, I know why I upset people. And I know I’ll probably do similarly stupid things again.

**Mental illness is fundamentally lonely**

At a certain point in mania, I got frustrated that no-one thought I was telepathic like I knew I was and depression told me that no-one out there cared or understood. In deepest depression I can’t even vocalise what I’m feeling, so what use is a hotline?

It was actually helpful to be sectioned whilst manic. Being around other people who were uncertain about the nature of reality was somewhat comforting.",917,0

A couple days ago I learned that my grandma is getting pretty sick and that there isn't a whole lot that anyone can do. Obviously we can't visit because of COVID. So it's a sad time. (She's had a long and good life. I've been lucky to have her in my life. It's natural and everyone eventually dies, but it's still sad, you know?)


Anyway, at the risk of sounding like I have a heart of stone, the sadness I feel about the situation with my grandma is a lot easier to deal with than depressive episodes. It's an emotional reaction to an event. I'm sad, but I'm still myself. 


Depressive episodes are *nothing* like this sadness. During those episodes it feels like black tar is oozing through my veins instead of blood. I've never felt happiness before and I never will. Everything is dark and there isn't an escape. 


Then when the pendulum swings the other way it feels like my body is on vibrate, but *just* fast enough to be at a high-pitched hum. It's like I'm watching the part of my favorite movie that comes *right before* the climax but the climax never comes. I *want* to do everything but if I sit down to do anything I'll explode.


Normal happiness? Nothing like that.


It seems like happiness and sadness are *reactions*. They're the effect, not the cause. Depression and mania are the opposite for me. They occur by themselves and affect other parts of my life. I'm not feeling happy because I'm listening to a good song, I'm playing the first 10 seconds of 15 different songs because I'm looking for a way to externalize the intense energy I'm feeling. 


Happiness and sadness change the way I feel, but depression and mania change the way I see.",772,0

3861,lb1ouw,My semester GPA is 4.00!,"My hands are shaking and I am in complete disbelief. I had been diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder I prior to starting college. I struggled with the med changes and was really unmotivated. 

After I had a breakdown because of not being able to focus on the exam, my meds finally started to work together. 

My mood stabilizers made it really hard for me to adjust the stimulant dosage and I developed a pill taking phobia but I am finally stable.

I don't have many people around me to celebrate my GPA because of my destructive manic episodes and I know it isn'y much since it is only semester GPA but I feel proud of myself. 

Thank you guys for the community! I would feel so alone and lost otherwise.",756,0
